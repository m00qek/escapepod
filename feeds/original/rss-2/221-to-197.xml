Practically the first thing she did when she took in the alien was to give him a new name. He looked at her outstretched hand long enough to annoy her, and then grasped it with his four opposable fingers and hung on limply until she wrenched her hand out of his moist and over-jointed grip.

She said, "I'm Sarah," and he said his name, or what she assumed was his name, in return, rolling the syllables around in his mouth like so many rough pebbles. His name was too long, something like Shperidth with extra grunting noises in the middle, like a car backfiring very far away. She tried to repeat it and couldn't, while he stood on her doorstep sweating and folding his fingers around each other. She frowned at him.

"I can't say that," she said.

Rated PG-13 for some adult situations and coarse language.

Violet frowned. "You were supposed to dig up the backstory on the dress."

"Well, you can't blame me for getting a little distracted. Besides, isn't it bad luck for me to see?"

"That's only for weddings, not prom."

First appeared at Robin Sloan's blog, June 8, 2009.

ITrsquo;S 2:02 A.M. ON A COLD SUMMER NIGHT.

Irsquo;m sitting in a book store next to a strip club.

Not that kind of book store. The inventory here is incredibly old and impossibly rare. And it has a secretmdash;a secret that I might have just discovered.

I am alone in the store. And then, tap-tap, suddenly Irsquo;m not.

And now Irsquo;m pretty sure Irsquo;m about to snap my laptop shut, run screaming out the front door, and never return.

Rated G. May contain creepy imagery and disturbing data visualizations.

<p><em>He was in Piet&#8217;s Number Seven, a bar-cum-caravanserai in an illegal orbit trailing far enough behind Vesta to be ignorable.

You could store entire cities in Piet&#8217;s cubage, which made for a somewhat attenuated bar experience.

When I met Skinhorse, my first thought was old.  Which was weird.  Nobody gets old these days.  We all die young, some of us after living a long time, if we're lucky.

He was in Piet's Number Seven, a bar-cum-caravanserai in an illegal orbit trailing far enough behind Vesta to be ignorable.  Piet's had been instantiated in an old volatiles bladder that had done the Jovian run a few too many times before falling into the surplus circuit.  You could store entire cities in Piet's cubage, which made for a somewhat attenuated bar experience.  Plus the place had one of those gravity cans -- yes, those gravity cans -- which meant your drink stayed stuck down long as you were near a Higgs carpet.

So there I was annoying myself with three perfectly disrespectable rock jocks, each of us out to fleece the others, when this cadaver starts to stand over me.  We're all forever young or forever dead, but this armstrong looked like he'd shaved about half a cent too deep across his whole body, then restored his dermis with spray-on thermal insulation.

Rated R for strong language, strong violence, and world-spanning tumors.

Wren Hex-Yemenni woke early. They had to teach her everything from scratch, and there wasnrsquo;t time for her to learn anything new before she hit fifty and had to be expired.

ldquo;Watch it,rdquo; the other techs told me when I was starting out. ldquo;You donrsquo;t want a Hex on your hands.rdquo;

By then we were monitoring Wren Hepta-Yemenni. She fell into bed with Dorado ambassador 214, though I donrsquo;t know what he did to deserve it and she didnrsquo;t even seem sad when he expired.

Closing song by Andrew Richardson

We've got robotic arms to put the eyeballs in. Metal clamps to pulldown the eyelids. Tony, on Four, keeps the grease vats filled. Oil squirts nineteen times a minute to keep the eye sockets from squeaking. Tiny slick needles stitch on the lashes, while millions of different irises get stamped in magenta and yellow and cyan, so no two will ever be alike, just like us.

All that, and they can't engineer anythingmdash;or anyonemdash;to take over my job. People in Organs go home coated with grease and vinegar; people in Bones have lost fingers to the machines, and still nobody wants the job where a hundred half-live cyborgs line up in rows, twitching when your back is turned. Waiting for someone to talk to them, feel for them. Transcend them to life.


There are safety signs around the factory. "Scrub Up." "Know Thyself." "Don't Blink." That last is the best piece of advice, here on the eyeball floor.

Rated PG for for angry awakening sentience and some swearing.

Previously appeared in Asimov's.

In January, there will be an annular solar eclipse, with the path of annularity moving through the Indian Ocean and into Sumatra and Borneo. Two days later, aliens will invade Earth.

No spaceships will loom large in blue skies, nor hover over our cities. At night, though, when we see blinking dots of light near the horizon, as small and pale as any star, we'll think they're planes or satellites of human origin. They won't be. These are alien ships, come for conquest.

That is all we can see. What we hear is just as faint and difficult to resolve: we hear rumors. Or rather, one persistent rumor: "the aliens want volunteers."

Naturally, I and my junior faculty friends need to drink quantities of beer to discuss this in detail. I expound that it's a hoax.

Rated PG-13 for adult concepts and alien recruiters.

"Buggerit, I don't have time for this," Joe muttered. The stable waiting for the small herd of cloned spidercows cluttering up the north paddock was still knee-deep in manure, and the tractor seat wasn't getting any warmer while he shivered out here waiting for Maddie to come and sort this thing out. It wasn't a big herd, but it was as big as his land and his labour could manage ndash; the big biofabricator in the shed could assemble mammalian livestock faster than he could feed them up and sell them with an honest HAND-RAISED NOT VAT-GROWN label.

"What do you want with us?" he yelled up at the gently buzzing farm.

"Brains, fresh brains for baby Jesus," crooned the farm in a warm contralto, startling Joe half out of his skin. "Buy my brains!" Half a dozen disturbing cauliflower shapes poked suggestively out of the farms' back then retracted again, coyly.

"Don't want no brains around here," Joe said stubbornly, his fingers whitening on the stock of the shotgun. "Don't want your kind round here, neither. Go away."

Kevin switched the audio over to the projector. The lecture hall was filled with outdoor noises. Wind hummed softly over the microphone, cattle lowed nearby, a truck accelerated in the distance.

A roan steer staggered around a concreted yard, its mute distress accompanied by clattering hooves and the fleshy slap of its thigh striking the ground when it fell. A new sound was introduced - incongruous, but familiar to Kevin's audience.

Whale song.

Gradually, the cow's shaking stilled, until it could stand securely. Its muscles continued to tremble, but not enough to upset its equilibrium while it listened.

Rated PG-13 for violence and mad cow disease.

Zhi 4's scream pierces the Siberian night. 



My spiked metal boots crunch through the snow as I race towards him, with Zhi 6 running at my side. The nanochip in my brainstem clicks on, and I reach out with my mind, but I can't sense even a trace of Zhi 4. A few seconds earlier his form had been outlined by the dark turquoise glow of the force field.



We stop twenty feet short of the field's perimeter. Beyond it, the hazy silhouette of the colossal Stalk looms, its millions of cilia undulating.


My bodysuit hums as it transmits data back to Xiang Xu Base, situated behind the Rusanov ice cap half a mile away.



My pulse flutters in anticipation and I take a deep breath to try to rein in my excitement. I -- like all Zhis -- have been designed with an insatiable curiosity about the Stalk's origins and vulnerabilities. Knowing I've been bred to feel this way doesn't make me feel it any less. Where did the Stalk come from? Why is it here? How can it thrive in these temperatures? I see the same questions reflected in Zhi 6's expression.

Rated PG-13 for cloning and some adult themes.

 "You're a disgrace to your calling and your species." The Cardinal's words were at odds with the verging-on-seductive voice of the translator embedded in the Anturean's Chlor-tank. From beneath lowered lashes Ignatz O'Reilly, D.D. Inter-Species, watched his superior's mouth-tendrils vibrate, a gesture he knew denoted extreme lust or mounting rage.

 Lust was out of the question, he supposed.

 "Falling-down drunk at Mass. Passing out in Confession. And don't think your little black-market dealings go unnoticed." The Cardinal's posterior spines flushed blue. Ignatz averted his eyes even further, studying the faint brown lines crisscrossing each other on a slate floor the color of dried blood. The mutant squid bastard really was mad this time. 

 "If I might be permitted to explain, Your Eminence..." Ignatz's tongue tasted like last night's liquor. "I indulge for purely medicinal reasons...a slight asthmatic condition...any allegations that I would engage in illegal..."

Rated R for religious themes, carousing, and transubstantiaton of a different sort.

<p>There are a number of good writers now breaking into the big leagues through podcasting.  My friend <a href="http://jchutchins.net">J.C. Hutchins</a> is one of them.  I loved his <a href="http://www.7thsonnovel.com">7th Son</a> trilogy, and I jumped at the chance when he asked me to read an advance copy of his horror novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312383827?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=escapepod-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0312383827">Personal Effects: Dark Art</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=escapepod-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=0312383827" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> and record a reaction for him.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my initial reaction (Hutch liked it enough that he added the background music and bumper titling and such):</p>

<p><object width="360" height="207"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4947110&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00adef&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4947110&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00adef&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="360" height="207"></embed></object></p>

<p>And here&#8217;s the big group &#8220;vlurb&#8221; project that my piece was a part of:</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/5070261">J.C. Hutchins&#8217;s &#8220;Personal Effects: Dark Art&#8221; - SuperVlurb</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/sfeley">Stephen Eley</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>(The folks in that vlurb are all awesome and you should check out their sites: <a href="http://PJBallantine.com">Philippa Ballantine</a>, <a href="http://scottsigler.com">Scott Sigler</a>, <a href="http://sethharwood.com">Seth Harwood</a>, <a href="http://wordsushi.com">Mark Yoshimoto Nemcoff</a>, <a href="http://christianaellis.com">Christiana Ellis</a>, <a href="http://Matt-Wallace.com">Matt Wallace</a>, <a href="http://jamesmelzer.net">James Melzer</a>, <a href="http://maxquickseries.com">Mark Jeffrey</a>, <a href="http://murverse.com">Mur Lafferty</a>, <a href="http://crescentstation.net">Phil Rossi</a> and <a href="http://mattselznick.com">Matt Selznick</a>.)</p>

<p>I read the book in PDF form.  And then I pre-ordered it on Amazon, because it&#8217;s just that good.  (Also because the little goodies that come with the physical copy sound like fun.)  This is an unusual horror novel: it brings in a lot of conventional settings and tropes, but the characters break from formula in some surprising ways.  And it&#8217;s a <i>smart</i> horror novel.  Silliness in hats aside, I highly recommend it.</p>

There are a number of good writers now breaking into the big leagues through podcasting.  My friend J.C. Hutchins is one of them.  I loved his 7th Son trilogy, and I jumped at the chance when he asked me to read an advance copy of his horror novel Personal Effects: Dark Art and record a reaction for him.

Here's my initial reaction (Hutch liked it enough that he added the background music and bumper titling and such):

<p><em>Mr. Wayne was taking his daily exercise, walking Arthur around the lake in Nevley Park, when the sky darkened and a light snow began to fall. A few flakes fluttered against his cheeks. He could feel the cold through his heavy topcoat. He enjoyed the park when it was deserted, but at his age he couldn&#8217;t afford a chill. He thumbed the control in his pocket. Arthur turned left onto a bridge that would cut their return journey by a good half mile. Mr. Wayne followed.</em></p>

<p>Rated <strong>K9</strong> for dogs at the cutting edge.</p>

Mr. Wayne was taking his daily exercise, walking Arthur around the lake in Nevley Park, when the sky darkened and a light snow began to fall. A few flakes fluttered against his cheeks. He could feel the cold through his heavy topcoat. He enjoyed the park when it was deserted, but at his age he couldn't afford a chill. He thumbed the control in his pocket. Arthur turned left onto a bridge that would cut their return journey by a good half mile. Mr. Wayne followed.



Rated K9 for dogs at the cutting edge.

<p><em>The biggest rocket ever was the Saturn V.  On the launch pad it was taller than a 30-story building.  Today&#8217;s rockets are smaller and lighter.  Today&#8217;s rockets can be launched more than once.  They have wings and can come back to earth and land like airplanes.</em></p>

<p><em>When a rocket launches, it&#8217;s like an earthquake. The ground is shaking! There is flame and smoke. It&#8217;s like an explosion!</em></p>

<p><em>Antonio is strapped into his seat.  He is about to ride to a space station.  Because there is no air in space, Antonio must wear a space suit.  In the suit, Antonio can breathe and talk over radio.  He wears a helmet with a special faceplate that protects him from the sun.  The fingers of his gloves have tiny claws that help him work with small objects.</em></p>

<p><em>What&#8217;s all that noise? It must be a rocket! Astronauts are traveling to space!</em></p>

Kegelman-Ballston Corporation is proud to announce the first public release of its new drug, Halitex, which cures Ulbarton’s Flu completely after one ten-pill course of treatment.  Ulbarton’s Flu, as the public knows all too well, now afflicts upwards of thirty million Americans, with the number growing daily as the highly contagious flu spreads.  Halitex “flu-proofs” the body by inserting genes tailored to confer immunity to this persistent and debilitating scourge, whose symptoms include coughing, muscle aches, and fatigue.  Because the virus remains in the body even after symptoms disappear, Ulbarton’s Flu can recur in a given patient at any time.  Halitex renders each recurrence ineffectual.</em></p>

Some of them you’ll have seen, some you won’t, some you’ll agree with me on and some you’ll wonder what I was drinking when I watched them but that’s half the fun.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>Just a quick note that Escape Pod episode 200 will <em>probably</em> not be going out on our usual Thursday schedule this week.  We&#8217;ve been negotiating for the rights to a Major Story by a Major Author.  We&#8217;re dealing with the literary agency for the author&#8217;s estate, which is always a slower process than working with living authors directly.  Everything appears to be a green light and the story production is moving ahead at speed, but we&#8217;re waiting on final signatures.  It&#8217;s my expectation that we&#8217;ll have the episode out within a few days.  (Certainly before next week&#8217;s regularly scheduled EP201!)</p>

<p>And it&#8217;s worth it.  When you hear the story I think you&#8217;ll agree.  Thank you for your patience.</p>

<p>&mdash; Steve</p>

Her boyfriend put a slim hand to his forehead, as though shielding his eyes
from sunlight, even though the sun had set some minutes before. Where the
