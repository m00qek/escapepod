“Go to hell, idiot,” I said, using an astringent tongue he’d understand. “I
am but a monumental slab of granite, and you, mortality, are like one of
the droppings of a fairly large corpulent deity–an ephemeral honor I would
rather pass me by.”

“And yet, you speak to me, mountain,” said the mote of humanity. “Why is
that?”

I considered that for a moment.  The creature had a point.

“I don’t know,” I replied honestly.

Rated PG.  Contains some profanity.  Paradigms may shift without warning.

When the floods came, all us kids climbed into bed and pulled the covers up over our heads while our parents rushed about trying to do something to stop it.  As the water level rose we could feel the beds lift off the floor, floating through our houses, bumping down our hallways and out our front doors.

We sat up in bed waved to one another as our beds merged onto the canal that now flowed between our houses.  We shrieked and giggled as our beds spun and bumped along with the swirling water.  Waves lapped at our boxsprings, but our covers were still warm and dry.

Rated G.  It’s apocalyptic fantasy — for kids!

<li>The new <a href="http://podcasts.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Podcasts</a> directory launched on Monday.  What&#8217;s more, they&#8217;ve chosen to feature Escape Pod as one of their &#8220;New &#038; Noteworthy&#8221; podcasts for their debut week!  This is the first time we&#8217;ve had prominent front-page status on any major podcast portal, and we&#8217;re just tickled about it.  If it suits you, feel free to visit <a href="http://podcasts.yahoo.com/series?s=7ba2408f95e9e6e8c6a29c763c044603">our page</a> there and rate us or leave us a review.  And to everyone who just found us via Yahoo!, welcome.</li>
<li>I had the pleasure of speaking with Mur Lafferty for her <a href="http://shouldwrite.blogspot.com/2005/10/show-8-late-and-long.html">I Should Be Writing</a> podcast, a resource specifically for beginning writers.  We had a good conversation, talking about Escape Pod, the <a href="http://www.sff.net/paradise">Viable Paradise</a> workshop, and perspectives on writing and persistence.  If you&#8217;re writing and still working to get published, you really should be listening to Mur&#8217;s show.  Check it out!</li>
<li>Fan art!  FNH sent us this fun little piece from the <i>inside</i> of our logo:<br />

      <itunes:summary>It’s been a busy week for Escape Pod.  I’ve got a few shoutouts accumulated over the past few days, so let’s get to them all:


The new Yahoo! Podcasts directory launched on Monday.  What’s more, they’ve chosen to feature Escape Pod as one of their “New &amp; Noteworthy” podcasts for their debut week!  This is the first time we’ve had prominent front-page status on any major podcast portal, and we’re just tickled about it.  If it suits you, feel free to visit our page there and rate us or leave us a review.  And to everyone who just found us via Yahoo!, welcome.
I had the pleasure of speaking with Mur Lafferty for her I Should Be Writing podcast, a resource specifically for beginning writers.  We had a good conversation, talking about Escape Pod, the Viable Paradise workshop, and perspectives on writing and persistence.  If you’re writing and still working to get published, you really should be listening to Mur’s show.  Check it out!

<p><i>We don&#8217;t have our own priest, or even our own church, so someone has to drive in a pickup truck to get the priest from El Puentecito.  But don&#8217;t be fooled by what you may hear in Malpasa or in Palpan de Baranda.  Here we remain Catholic.  Yes, we make pots in the old way.  That&#8217;s why tourists come here.  And it&#8217;s true, as is sometimes whispered, that we have restored certain other practices from the past.  But not as they were done back then.  Those were bloody and terrible times, the times of the Mejica.  They say that the sacrificial blood covered the sun pyramids from top to bottom.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I just mentioned in the <a href="http://www.escapepod.info/2005/09/27/ep-metacast-1/">Metacast</a>, we&#8217;ve got the opportunity to give away some collectibles related to the Neil Gaiman movie <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/mirrormask/">Mirrormask</a>, opening in limited release on September 30.  Not exactly sure yet what the stuff&#8217;s going to be, but I was told &#8220;Several large posters, a couple sets of action figures.&#8221;  Works for me.</p>

<p>So what can you do to win this stuff?  Just <a href="mailto:editor@extraneous.org">drop me a line</a> or <a href="http://www.escapepod.info/forum/viewforum.php?f=10">post in our forum</a> with your personal answers to the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What was your favorite story on Escape Pod so far?</li>
<li>How did you first hear about Escape Pod?</li>
<li>Is there anything you&#8217;d like to see more of or less of?  Any new features you&#8217;d like us to offer?  Anything we should do differently?</li>
</ol>

<p>Be honest.  Be creative.  After a couple of weeks (let&#8217;s say Sunday, October 9) I&#8217;ll randomly pick some of the people who responded and contact them for their addresses.  Not sure how much stuff we have to give away yet, so I can&#8217;t tell you how many winners there will be.  But you&#8217;ll be helping us make Escape Pod better, so it&#8217;s worth it regardless.  Right?</p>]]></content:encoded>

I did the sensible thing.  I screamed and ran to the bathroom, where I started tossing cups of water on my crotch in the hopes of extinguishing the flames.  My boyfriend ran in behind me, started the shower up, and tossed me into the freezing water.  But the fire continued to rage, despite the dousing.

At that point, I realized that I wasn’t actually in any pain.  I stepped out of the stream of water, teeth still chattering, and held my hand in the blue flames.  “This should hurt,” I said.

Rated X.  For blasphemy and anatomy.  Really.

      <itunes:summary>This won’t be news for the many of you who listen to it, but Escape Pod was featured yesterday on Rob Walch’s excellent Podcast411 podcast.  That my interview with him sounded decent is a tribute to his masterful editing skills.  And if you’re not familiar with his podcast, I highly recommend you check it out — it’s most often described as “Inside the Actor’s Studio” for podcasts.  I’ve learned something from every guest he’s had on.

Creator set him gently into his angel&#8217;s hand.  Her hands, much smaller than
the Creator&#8217;s&#8211;which was fitting since who among the angels had such power

<p><b>Rated PG</b>.  Contains explicit existentialism and violence of the soul.  (The intro contains minor profanity and frank discussions of current events, and is likely to be more offensive than the story.)</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I should have mentioned this before, but time&#8217;s been sneaking up on me:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to be a guest at <a href="http://www.dragoncon.org">Dragon*Con</a> this weekend in Atlanta, along with <a href="http://www.geekfuactiongrip.com">Mur</a>, <a href="http://www.dragonpage.com">Michael &amp; Evo</a>, <a href="http://www.skepticality.com">Derek</a>,  and many other fun folks in the podcasting world.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re all going to putting up a panel on podcasting in the Electronic Frontiers track, at the utterly insane time of <b>11:30 PM Friday</b>.  Yeah, I know that&#8217;s the time most people are hunting for bodypainted elves on the hotel party floors, but if you&#8217;re around we promise our panel will be <i>almost</i> as much fun.  I&#8217;m also running a panel for the Science track at <b>10 PM Sunday</b> called &#8220;Burn, Hollywood, Burn!&#8221; and will be generally flitting around the rest of the time looking to socialize.</p>

<p>One thing I&#8217;d like to do is have at least one lunch or bar meet-up with podcast listeners.  I don&#8217;t have concrete plans yet, unfortunately, since I haven&#8217;t scouted out the lay of the land.  But if you&#8217;re going to be at D*C and you&#8217;re so inclined, <a href="sfeley@gmail.com">drop me a line</a> with your contact info (preferably cellphone, and let me know if your phone can do SMS) and I&#8217;ll give you mine, and if there&#8217;s at least one of you we&#8217;ll figure it out.  If there are several responses I&#8217;ll actually organize a real event and post it here, so keep checking this space if you get a chance.</p>

<p>Thanks very much.  Next year we&#8217;ll be a lot more organized about con presence: I&#8217;m already making plans to hit <a href="http://www.laconiv.com/">Worldcon</a> <i>and</i> <a href="http://www.dragoncon.org">Dragon*Con</a> in consecutive weeks on both coasts.  Meanwhile, I hope I&#8217;ll get a chance to see some of you this weekend!</p>]]></content:encoded>
