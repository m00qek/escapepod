Nobody wanted to see the meanies anyway.  They had us Made and then hated us afterwards, which wasn&#8217;t fair.  All arties know you love the things you Make no matter what.  But Elderfolk were just-plains all grown up and they didn&#8217;t make any sense at all.  Some of the younger arties started to talk about going back, but we older arties who knew Niles better said no, that we&#8217;d wait.</i></p>

<p><i>Three days passed before Niles came back.  It was dark and everyone was sleeping but me, because little Boo&#8217;s music itched in my brain.  He came in carrying big boxes, and I cried big tears of happy at that.  He&#8217;d brought some new supplies, and we&#8217;d be Making again in no time flat.  I watched him for a while, carrying in box after box, and finally I fell asleep.  It felt good knowing he was back.</i></p>

down when we were together, and back up when we were apart, he&#8217;d return
his consulting fee to the city.&#8221;  The shake made a satisfying plopping

Read by Frank Key (of Hooting Yard).

Humans laid the foundation for the sixth apocalypse in much the same way they'd triggered the previous ones. Having recovered their ambition after the Apocalypse of Serotonin and rebuilt their populations after the Apocalypse of Grease, they once again embarked on their species' long term goal to wreak as much havoc as possible on the environment through carelessness and boredom. This time, the trees protested. They devoured buildings, whipped wind into hurricanes between their branches, tangled men into their roots and devoured them as mulch. In retaliation, men chopped down trees, fire-bombed jungles, and released genetically engineered insects to devour tender shoots.


The pitched battle decimated civilians on both sides, but eventually -- though infested and rootless -- the trees overwhelmed their opposition. Mankind was forced to send its battered representatives to a sacred grove in the middle of the worldrsquo;s oldest forest and beg for a treaty.


Rated PG.  Contains war, invasion, exodus, mass extinction, religious revival, and a lot of mud.

<p><i>I just swab my arm and administer the cocktail, a booster for my
radiation immunization. The taste of brass fills my mouth in seconds,
and I know that the cocktail has flooded my system. With this stuff
burbling inside, I can stare down three sieverts without blinking, or,
more importantly, losing my immune system, teeth, hair, and intestines.</i></p>

<p><i>When I finish with my dose, I grab the skin on the newbie&#8217;s arm, swab
her and shoot her up, too. &#8220;Ow!&#8221; She jumps and rubs her arm. I watch
carefully to see her smack her lips at the taste. &#8220;You could&#8217;ve warned
me.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>&#8220;No time,&#8221; I say, doctoring Ken and the others just as abruptly. We&#8217;re
pressed, and they know it.</i></p>

<p><i>We&#8217;re all nice and anodized on the inside at 8:12. We&#8217;re waiting for
8:16, or thereabouts. There aren&#8217;t any atomic clocks in 1945, so all
times are approximate, internally speaking. And from here on in, there&#8217;s
no point speaking any other way.</i></p>

<p><b>Rated PG</b>.  Contains mass destruction and graphic descriptions of the wounded.</p>

I just swab my arm and administer the cocktail, a booster for my
radiation immunization. The taste of brass fills my mouth in seconds,
and I know that the cocktail has flooded my system. With this stuff
burbling inside, I can stare down three sieverts without blinking, or,
more importantly, losing my immune system, teeth, hair, and intestines.

When I finish with my dose, I grab the skin on the newbie's arm, swab
her and shoot her up, too. "Ow!" She jumps and rubs her arm. I watch
carefully to see her smack her lips at the taste. "You could've warned
me."

"No time," I say, doctoring Ken and the others just as abruptly. We're
pressed, and they know it.

We're all nice and anodized on the inside at 8:12. We're waiting for
8:16, or thereabouts. There aren't any atomic clocks in 1945, so all
times are approximate, internally speaking. And from here on in, there's
no point speaking any other way.

Rated PG.  Contains mass destruction and graphic descriptions of the wounded.

Every now and then we strike it rich. Usually we make a profit. Once in a while we just break even. There's only been one world where we actually lost money; I still remember it -- Greenwillow. Except that it wasn't green, and there wasn't a willow on the whole damned planet.

There was a robot, though. We found him, me and the Baroni, in a barn, half-hidden under a pile of ancient computer parts and self-feeders for mutated cattle. We were picking through the stuff, wondering if there was any market for it, tossing most of it aside, when the sun peeked in through the doorway and glinted off a prismatic eye.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been in e-mail contact today with Jeffrey DeRego&#8217;s wife Cindy.  She tells me that he had open heart surgery yesterday to bypass five blocked arteries.  The surgery was successful and he&#8217;s expected to go home sometime next week.</p>

<p>If anyone cares to know for purposes of sending cards or flowers, etc., he&#8217;s at the Catholic Medical Center in Manchester, New Hampshire.  You&#8217;re also welcome to send cards via us (<b>Jeffrey DeRego, c/o Escape Artists Inc., PO Box 1538, Stone Mountain GA  30086</b>) and I&#8217;ll see that they get forwarded to him.</p>

<p>I asked if any financial assistance would be useful, and without getting into overly personal details, the answer is &#8220;yes.&#8221;  The DeRegos aren&#8217;t in a good position right now in terms of employment, and while they&#8217;re applying for state assistance, surgery of this magnitude is still certain to have a very harsh impact.  Escape Artists will be making a contribution, and with Cindy&#8217;s permission, I&#8217;m asking the Escape Pod listenership to help out.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve set up a PayPal address just for this purpose under our corporate account.  If you&#8217;d like to help Jeff out, please send your contributions via PayPal to <b>derego@escapepod.org</b>.  (I hope to have a better link on the sidebar by tonight.)  We&#8217;ll cover PayPal fees, so 100% of funds donated will go to defray Jeff&#8217;s and Cindy&#8217;s medical expenses.  I&#8217;ll keep that PayPal address open through September.</p>

<p>Please follow your conscience on whether to help.  Jeff&#8217;s given us some of our favorite EP stories, and I&#8217;m happy to do whatever I can for him.  If you see fit to help him out too, I&#8217;m sure he and his wife would be very grateful.  Thanks for your attention.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First: my apologies for recent delays in getting Escape Pod out; in the last couple of weeks it&#8217;s hit the feed Friday afternoons rather than late Thursday.  It&#8217;s <em>probably</em> going to happen again this week.  Personal business lately has included me losing my day job, finding a new and much better day job in the space of a couple of weeks (I start Tuesday), and taking on some short-term obligations to fill in the gaps.  Expect more on that in an upcoming metacast In the meantime I&#8217;m realizing I&#8217;m having to get <em>much</em> better organized with a lot of Escape Artists work, not for efficiency but for necessity.  So yes, things are late; but I still don&#8217;t expect to miss any weeks, and I hope that the lateness will be short term.</p>

<p>Now to the news: once again, Escape Pod and Minx&#8217;s <a href="http://polyweekly.com">Polyamory Weekly</a> will be hosting a joint meetup at Dragon*Con.  Just like last year, we&#8217;ll be doing a group brunch on <b>SUNDAY, AUGUST 31 AT 11:30 AM</b>, at the <a href="http://gordonbiersch.com/restaurants/index.php?pg=location&#038;sub=loc&#038;location_id=28">Gordon Biersch Brewpub</a>.  It&#8217;s about a mile north from the hotels, but an easy walk or cab ride.  This time we have the restaurant&#8217;s upper mezzanine reserved, so it&#8217;s like having the place to ourselves.  Ask at the front for the Escape Pod meetup.</p>

<p>Generally, I expect to hit very little programming at this year&#8217;s D*C.  My intent for almost the entire con is just to hang out at the bars or parties, and socialize and relax.  If you&#8217;d like to join me, follow my <a href="http://twitter.com/SFEley">Twitter feed</a> to find out where I am or <a href="mailto:sfeley@gmail.com">drop me a line</a> to met me know where you are.  And if you know where the <i>good</i> parties are &#8212; let me know too!</p>

<p>Thanks, and we&#8217;ll have the next EP up as soon as possible.  (It&#8217;s a Union Dues story, if that helps with the waiting.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Fenneman?&#8221;</p>

<p>The studio audience laughed loudly, as it always did when Groucho 
turned, in mock desperation or annoyance, to his long-suffering, 
hopelessly square announcer.  Groucho&#8217;s voice slightly increased in 
pitch whenever he said Fenneman’s name, as if he were just at the edge 
of losing his celebrated cool.  This half-squawk had been funny in the 
stateroom scene of <strong>A Night at the Opera</strong> (&#8221;Steward!  Steward!&#8221;), and 
it was still funny on <strong>You Bet Your Life</strong> twenty-five years later.  He 
was a pro, Groucho was, and I did right by him; I modulated that pitch 
myself.</p>

<p><b>Rated R</b>.  Contains profanity, and real and simulated persons behaving badly.</p>

"Fenneman?"

The studio audience laughed loudly, as it always did when Groucho 
turned, in mock desperation or annoyance, to his long-suffering, 
hopelessly square announcer.  Groucho's voice slightly increased in 
pitch whenever he said Fennemanrsquo;s name, as if he were just at the edge 
of losing his celebrated cool.  This half-squawk had been funny in the 
stateroom scene of A Night at the Opera ("Steward!  Steward!"), and

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sorry folks.  I know that EP is getting to the point where it&#8217;s <em>usually</em> late these days, but today it&#8217;s going to be a bit later than usual.  There are a few good reasons for it &#8212; some related to the content itself, and some related to things going on with me &#8212; but it would be inappropriate for me to go into all of it right this moment.  We&#8217;re <em>not</em> skipping a week, and I&#8217;m fairly certain EP170 will be posted by noon today.</p>

<p>In the meantime, by way of apology and spurred by some demand for it in the forums, here&#8217;s a minor bonus for those interested: the raw, mostly unedited recording session from Dr. Bowie&#8217;s and my reading of &#8220;How I Mounted Goldie, Saved My Partner Lori, and Sniffed Out the People&#8217;s Justice&#8221; last week.  If you enjoy knowing how the sausage gets made, this particular file is a slightly more entertaining example than most.  This isn&#8217;t going into the feed, because it isn&#8217;t really an Escape Pod episode; you&#8217;ll have to either listen in the browser, or right-click on it and download it yourself if you want to hear it.</p>

another man&#8217;s child to the World. She acidified the pores in her

his disc-shaped body.</i></p>

<p><i>He didn&#8217;t look bad, but he wasn&#8217;t as comely as Senator Wu. Her body

<p><em>They try everything. Cellular toxins. DNA replication inhibitors. Anti-sense nucleic acids. Artillery. Great bolts of lightning. Nothing stops him, it only makes the monster angrier. They try mutagens, teratogens, carcinogens, neurotoxins, hemotoxins, genotoxins — they think that toxins in the environment created the monster, and maybe toxins can kill it. Maybe two wrongs can make a right.</em></p>

<p><em>They don&#8217;t, apparently. I worry about the residues left in the ground after the monster&#8217;s moved on. He&#8217;s going up and down the eastern seaboard. Janie talks about flying out there to help, but she doesn&#8217;t want to get stomped on. Who would? A team of guys from work drive across the country to do whatever they can. They figure that patent annuities can still get paid in their absence. I want to go, but I have to stay to help my mom. That&#8217;s my fight.</em></p>

They try everything. Cellular toxins. DNA replication inhibitors. Anti-sense nucleic acids. Artillery. Great bolts of lightning. Nothing stops him, it only makes the monster angrier. They try mutagens, teratogens, carcinogens, neurotoxins, hemotoxins, genotoxins mdash; they think that toxins in the environment created the monster, and maybe toxins can kill it. Maybe two wrongs can make a right.

They don't, apparently. I worry about the residues left in the ground after the monster's moved on. He's going up and down the eastern seaboard. Janie talks about flying out there to help, but she doesn't want to get stomped on. Who would? A team of guys from work drive across the country to do whatever they can. They figure that patent annuities can still get paid in their absence. I want to go, but I have to stay to help my mom. That's my fight.

Rated PG.  Contains violence on a grand scale and illness on a human scale.

<p><em>First, there’s the pressure.</p>

<p>A special kind of pressure, high under Tara’s chin, that makes her feel heavy and light all at once. She kneels by the chair and leans across the edge, because if she faints, the chair will roll away and she won’t choke. She’s always careful.</p>

<p>After the pressure she gets dizzy, and her vision gets kind of… narrow, dark around the edges. It’s hard to breathe, and it feels like there’s something stuck in her throat. Prickles run up and down her back, down her arms where the pain used to be, and a warm fluid kind of feeling sloshes around inside her. She slides down, as things get dark, and then she starts to dream.</p>

<p>But not like night time dreams. These are special.</em></p>

<p><strong>Rated R.</strong> Contains children engaging in extremely dangerous practices. Parental guidance STRONGLY recommended.</p>

I tilted my head slightly to see if some sense might roll downhill from his words. "Correct me if I'm wrong," I said, sucking on the wedge of flesh-colored fruit, "But isn't God Juice the stuff that caused your civilization to collapse?"

First appeared in Bruce Coville's Book of Aliens II, ed. Bruce Coville.

Jenny was silent for a while. "Promise me something?" she finally asked. "If they ever come for you, promise you'll let me know?"

"Why?" I had trouble believing Jenny really wanted to leave. Maybe this was all some sort of joke.

"Just promise," Jenny said.

"No." Even if she was serious, Jenny was the last person I wanted following me into space.

Jenny took a deep breath. "I'll tell you, too. If they ever come for me."

Rated G.  This is a young adult SF story.

First appeared in The New Space Opera, ed. Gardner Dozois #38; Jonathan Strahan.

When you're as old as I am, you'll find your memory's not what it was. It's not that you lose memories. That hasn't happened to me or anyone else since the Paleocosmic Era, the Old Space Age, when people lived in caves on the Moon. My trouble is that I've gained memories, and I don't know which of them are real. I was very casual about memory storage back then, I seem to recall. This could happen to you too, if you're not careful. So be warned. Do as I say, not as I did.

Some of the tales about me contradict each other, or couldn't possibly have happened, because that's how I told them in the first place. Others I blame on the writers and tellers. They make things up. I've never done that. If I've told stories that couldn't be true, it's because that's how I remember them.

Here's one.

First appeared in <a href="http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0805/Distantreplay.shtml">Asimov&#8217;s Science Fiction</a>, April/May 2007.</p>

<p><i>That Winter, Will le Fey held down a job working for a haint politician named Salem Toussaint. Chiefly, his function was to run errands while looking conspicuously solid. He fetched tax forms for the alderman’s constituents, delivered stacks of documents to trollish functionaries, fixed L&amp;I violations, presented boxes of candied John-the-Conqueror root to retiring secretaries, absent-mindedly dropped slim envelopes containing twenty-dollar bills on desks. When somebody important died, he brought a white goat to the back door of the Fane of Darkness to be sacrificed to the Nameless One. When somebody else’s son was drafted or went to prison, he hammered a nail in the nkisi nkonde that Toussaint kept in the office to ensure his safe return.</i></p>

<p><i>He canvassed voters in haint neighborhoods like Ginny Gall, Beluthahatchie, and Diddy-Wah-Diddy, where the bars were smoky, the music was good, and it was dangerous to smile at the whores. He negotiated the labyrinthine bureaucracies of City Hall. Not everything he did was strictly legal, but none of it was actually criminal. Salem Toussaint didn’t trust him enough for that. </i></p>

<p><b>Rated PG</b>.  Contains dark, seedy places and dark, seedy characters, only a few of them alive.</p>

I nodded.

<p><i>As far as I know I am the only Union member who works outside the system, the only one tasked specifically with fighting crime, secretly, of course.

First appeared in <a href="http://baens-universe.com/articles/The_Big_Guy/">Jim Baen&#8217;s Universe</a>, June 2007.</p>

<p><i>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; said Fishbait. He tossed a ball to the Big Guy. 
&#8220;Let&#8217;s try a little one-on-one. Ralph, let&#8217;s see what you can do 
against Jacko here.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>The Big Guy took a look at me, his face totally 
expressionless. I moved forward to lean on him a little, just 
enough to make contact and see which way he was going to move 
when he began his drive to the basket, but before I got close enough

First appeared in Jim Baen's Universe, June 2007.

"Okay," said Fishbait. He tossed a ball to the Big Guy. 
"Let's try a little one-on-one. Ralph, let's see what you can do 
against Jacko here."

The Big Guy took a look at me, his face totally 
expressionless. I moved forward to lean on him a little, just 
enough to make contact and see which way he was going to move 
when he began his drive to the basket, but before I got close enough 
to touch him he'd already raced by me and stuffed the ball through 
the hoop.

"Again," said Fishbait.

Rated R.  Contains strong language and testosterone.
