So there you have him, Frederick Bannister, tripping across the highways and byways of of life, stubbing a toe here, bruising an elbow there, spilling this, dropping that, and managing to make it to the halfway point without too many major accomplishments or disasters.

And what of Wilma?

She possessed massive storage capacity, and no fourth-level equation, no matter how complex, was beyond her, but whether she was bright or merely well programmed is a moot point. Or at least it was in the beginning.


Rated X.  Contains explicit sex of several kinds.  Not recommended for younger audiences.

<p><i>My mother left us on a slate-gray evening when I was five, with her namesake falling from the sky and piled high around the windows and doors.  Awakened by raised voices, I watched through a tear in the curtain that shielded my sleeping mat as my mother wrapped her limbs in a shining, white kimono.  As far back as I could remember, she had always worn the dark wool shifts that all mountain people wear, spun from the hair of the half-mad goats that give us milk and cheese.  In her kimono she looked like a princess, or a queen.  Her skin was paler than mine, and I am thought quite fair.

<p><i>Seated on a bollard, the man contemplatively removed his pipe, as if to tamp
it down or relight it. Instead, he placed it stem down in the top pocket of
his shirt, then reached up and pressed his fingers against his cheekbone and
forehead. His face came away from his hairline, round behind his ears, down
to a point just above his Adam’s apple. The inside of his mouth and much of
his sinus were also part of the prosthesis, so only bare eyeballs in the
upper jut of his skull remained – the rest being the black spikes and plates
of bio-interfaces.</i></p>

<p><i>Cheel gaped. From another pocket, the man took some sort of tool and began
to probe inside the back of his detached face. He put the prosthesis in his
lap, then took up his pipe and placed it in his throat sphincter. Smoke bled
from between the interface plates of his cheeks. His bare eyeballs swivelled
towards Cheel then back down to the adjustments he was making. She suddenly
realised who this must be. Here was the veteran who worked on the ferry.
Here was one of the few survivors from a brutal war between factions of
dense-tech humans. Not understanding what was impelling her, she walked out
on the jetty and approached him.

"I read an interesting forum post last night," my electric toothbrush told me over its low burr.

"Thiff ouff thew be thood," I said through my mouth of foam.

ldquo;It was!rdquo; he replied. "Using readily available components, Monkeymonkey turned his Intellibrush into a milk frother."

I spit into the sink and set my toothbrush in its white ceramic charger. "What would I do with a milk frother?"

"Make cappucinos," my toothbrush said, with a hint of resignation, as I rinsed and spit again.

"I donrsquo;t drink cappucinos," I said.

"You could start!"

<p><i>I was a child when the sky changed. I can still remember days when it was endlessly blue, the clouds passive and gentle. The change occurred without warning: one morning we awoke and the sky was a pale, blushing rose. We began to see intention in the slow, ceaseless movements of the clouds. Instead of floating, they swam spirals in the sky. They gathered in knots, trailing wisps like feet and tails. We felt them watching us.</i></p>

<p><i>We adapted. We had never taken more than we needed from the land, and we always kept our animals far from water. Now we moistened wild cotton and stretched this across our smoke holes as filters. Sometimes the clouds would gather over fires that were out in the open. A tendril would stretch down, weaving like a snake&#8217;s head, opening delicate mist jaws to nip the plume of smoke. Even the bravest warriors would quickly put such fires out.</i></p>

I beseech compassionate members of H. sapiens to speak favorably of me to her.  I am loyal, trustworthy, reliable, devoted, and extremely intelligent.  I would endeavor to give her stimulating companionship and emotional fulfillment ["happiness"] in all respects within my power.

Permit me to explain the pertinent circumstances.

The reflection of what appears to be a girl of eleven looks back at me from the full-length mirror in the bedroom that was my mother's. Together we spit out yet another baby tooth, which reminds me I need to drink another calcium-enriched protein shake. Either that, or eat what remains of my mother.

She's the pile of coarse dust scattered across the bedsheets. Some of my kind swear by mother dust, the way certain factions among the rest of the population swear by breast feeding. And there are benefits, whether you're still a kid with growing bones or an adult woman facing osteoporosis by the end of the week.
