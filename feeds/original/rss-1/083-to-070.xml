			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As promised in the past couple of episodes, our online storefront for selling podcast archive CDs is (finally!) up and running at <a href="http://poddisc.com">PodDisc.com</a>.  This is your chance to get all of your holiday shopping done in one place &#8212; provided everyone you know wants over 45 hours of science fiction short stories on CD.</p>

<p>What do the discs look like?  I&#8217;m glad you asked.  They look like this:</p>

<p><img src='/media/EP_Collection3.jpg' alt='Escape Pod Collection 3' width='350' height='350' /></p>

<p>Beautiful, isn&#8217;t it?  And for a very slight fee, you can have your own personal message put on the CD.  You can buy each disc for $10 or a bundle of all three collections for $25.  Shipping is a cheap flat rate in the U.S. (and tolerable everywhere else), and satisfaction is guaranteed.</p>

<p>Right now only Escape Pod CDs are available, but once the business model proves viable I plan to open this up to producing archive discs for other podcasters.  If that&#8217;s a service you&#8217;d be interested in, <a href="mailto:eley@escapeartists.info">drop me a line</a> and I&#8217;ll give you more details.  </p>

<p><i>And remember:</i> If you&#8217;ve donated $20 or more to Escape Pod this year, or if you&#8217;re a subscriber, don&#8217;t buy yet!  I&#8217;ll be sending details to you in e-mail on how you can get this stuff for free.  </p>

<p>&#8230;Right after I get some sleep.</p>

<p><i>&#8220;Which one are you?&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>The kid fans out a small stack of super hero trading cards, but it&#8217;s not a Union deck. Figures. &#8220;Lemme see what you got there.&#8221; I flip through and remember my old baseball card collection. I knew there was something special about me, when at nine-years-old, I accurately calculated the probable batting stats of each player, on every team, in the 1996 season after opening only one pack. The Union recruited me five years later after my dad beat a couple of Atlantic City casinos for ten million bucks. I was caught on security camera tape telling him when and how to bet at the roulette wheel.</i></p>

<p><i>&#8220;These don&#8217;t look like you.&#8221;</i><i></p>

<p></i><i>The card displays a blue-costumed man leaping between buildings. I hand it back to him. &#8220;Those guys aren&#8217;t real, but I am.&#8221; Wow. Did I just say that? Maybe I&#8217;ll tell the kid that Santa and the Easter Bunny aren&#8217;t real either. He&#8217;s staring at me now, I can almost see his little brain struggling to make sense of my answer.

“Which one are you?”

The kid fans out a small stack of super hero trading cards, but it’s not a Union deck. Figures. “Lemme see what you got there.” I flip through and remember my old baseball card collection. I knew there was something special about me, when at nine-years-old, I accurately calculated the probable batting stats of each player, on every team, in the 1996 season after opening only one pack. The Union recruited me five years later after my dad beat a couple of Atlantic City casinos for ten million bucks. I was caught on security camera tape telling him when and how to bet at the roulette wheel.

“These don’t look like you.”

The card displays a blue-costumed man leaping between buildings. I hand it back to him. “Those guys aren’t real, but I am.” Wow. Did I just say that? Maybe I’ll tell the kid that Santa and the Easter Bunny aren’t real either. He’s staring at me now, I can almost see his little brain struggling to make sense of my answer. I should tell him to buy Union Cards but, you know, he’s five.

Rated R.  Contains profanity, some violence involving children, and retail corporate exploitation.

        <itunes:summary>(Update 9/24:  Many of you will probably get a duplicate download.  This time it’s deliberate.  I had requested permission to play Janis Ian’s song, “God and the FBI,” but she was touring Europe and didn’t get my e-mail in time.  She just responded and graciously gave me permission, so I’m revising the file and including it at the end.  If you don’t want to hear the whole story again, just skip forward 41 minutes.  Thank you, Janis!)

By Harry Turtledove.
(Inspired by the song “God &amp; the FBI” by Janis Ian, published by Windham Hill.  Song included with Janis Ian’s permission.)

Two men left.  Franklin D. Roosevelt.  D for Delano, mind.  Governor of New York.  Cousin to Teddy Roosevelt.  Already ran for Vice President once.  Didn’t win.  Cigarette holder.  Jaunty angle.  Wheelchair.  Paralysis.  Anguish.  Courage.  As near an aristocrat as America grows.  Franklin D. Roosevelt.  D for Delano.

And Joe Steele.

Joe Steele.  Congressman from California.  Not San Francisco.  Not Nob Hill.  Good Lord, no.  Fresno.  Farm country.  That great valley, squeezed by mountains east and west.  Not a big fellow, Joe Steele.  Stands real straight, so you don’t notice too much.  Mustache, a good-sized one.  Thick head of hair just starting to go gray.  Eyelids like shutters.  When they go down and then come up again, you can’t see what was behind them.


Rated R.  Contains profanity and strong political themes.  Not happy politics, like we have today.  1930s politics.

Squonk lived with his mother, who was definitely not a dragon–she was a small blue bird named Mrs. Tweedle-Chirp.  Now, it is true that birds generally cannot lay dragon eggs, and Mrs. Tweedle-Chirp was no exception.  But, they can care for dragon eggs that they happen to find lying untended in the middle of the forest, assuming they are suitably ambitious.

Rated G.  This is a children’s story.  Have Fun.
