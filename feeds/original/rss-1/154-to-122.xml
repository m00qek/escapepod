Closing Music: &#8220;Juzt Mizunderztood&#8221; by <a href="http://www.normansherman.com/">Norm Sherman</a>.</p>

<p><i>My head throbs. I think about the mess in the fridge, the heaps of crap in the flat while I force the clumps of wet clothes into the dryers.</i></p>

<p><i>As far as I know I am the only Union member who works outside the system, the only one tasked specifically with fighting crime, secretly, of course. Darksider put the program together with one of the Luminaries as a way to explore expanding our role in the maintenance of Normal society. He chose me specifically because I am the only super-agile who is also an orphan. Therefore, I won&#8217;t be tempted to throw my costume in a dumpster and make a break for mom and dad.</i></p>

<p><i>Communication with the Union ended seven months ago. Darksider was supposed to make sure that a stipend was deposited into a bank account under my phony name every month. But that stopped too. I don&#8217;t know why. I tried everything to make contact short of walking up to the Boston Pyramid and knocking. Not that it would have done any good since none of the regular Union knows I even exist. </i></p>

This much is reality: Schwartz sits comfortably cocooned -- passive, suspended -- in a first-class passenger rack aboard a Japan Air Lines rocket, nine kilometers above the Coral Sea.  And this much is fantasy: the same Schwartz has passage on a shining starship gliding silkily through the interstellar depths, en route at nine times the velocity of light from Betelgeuse IX to Rigel XXI, or maybe from Andromeda to the Lesser Magellanic.

Rated R.  Contains some sex, some drug use.  It's a Silverberg story.

Closing music: &#8220;I Crush Everything&#8221; by <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com">Jonathan Coulton</a>.</p>

<p><i>I spent the longest five weeks of my life in that tank and in a deeper pool, healing, testing, practicing.  My feet and toes had been augmented much like my hands, my thighs shortened to maximize the available muscle.  I was damned quick.  Relearning construction techniques with my new fingers was sometimes frustrating, yet my progress was real and those periods of solitary labor became important to me.</i></p>

<p><i>At the surface, in the shallows, doctors poked and prodded and put me through redundant tortures.  I had been warned that the study of my new body would be extensive and did my best not to fear or hate them, but I&#8217;d never imagined such intense scrutiny.  During my years as a SEAL, I had been like a bug under a microscope, constantly evaluated and scored.  Here I was the microscope, my body the only lens through which they could measure their work.  Stenstrom tried to be my buddy, as he had always tried, joking and asking what I&#8217;d do with the money, yet his possessiveness was obvious.  &#8220;We&#8217;ll be famous,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll change the world.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>I wasn&#8217;t a slave or a pet, exactly, but I was anxious to get started.  To get away from them.</i></p>

"Do you know what's happened to the children?"

Edward swallowed.  Suddenly, he wanted to cry.  "Yes.  They're...sleeping?"

He hoped and hoped and hoped and hoped, grimacing as he did.  He looked

Makeshift beds lined the room.  Small hands gripped blankets, small eyes

"No."  The boy frowned.  "They've died."

"Because of Something Very Bad?"

"Yes.  And I need you to be a Very Brave Bear.  Can you do that?"

Rated PG.  Contains strong images of death and violence.  Almost certainly not appropriate for small children.

Read by Jared Axelrod (of <a href="http://planetx.libsyn.com/">The Voice of Free Planet X</a>).<br />
First appeared in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0972054774/escapepod-20">All-Star Zeppelin Adventure Stories</a> (ed. David Moles &amp; Jay Lake).</p>

<p><i>We are somewhere among the tallest mountains of the world. When we arrived, I was locked away in a cargo hold, so I don’t know exactly where. Our home is a small, drafty castle and a separate laboratory. Dr. Octavio had the locals construct the lab before he tested the new death ray on their village. There&#8217;s very little left there. In my little bit of spare time, I try to bury the bodies and collect anything useful to the doctor’s experiment.</i></p>

<p><i>My primary duties consist of keeping the castle&#8217;s furnace running and clearing the never-ending snow from the path between the two buildings. Sometimes, it falls too fast for my slow treads and shovel attachment to keep up with and I find myself half-buried in the snow. It is horrible on my gears when this happens, but I use heavyweight oil now and it helps.</i></p>

<p><i>It is one of the few benefits of my metal frame that I appreciate. Life in this contraption is like being wrapped in swaddling clothes. I wonder if I would feel anything if my casing caught on fire? I need to ask the doctor when he isn’t in one of his moods.</i></p>

<p><i>Gruen was on the sixty-first master, and while his wisdom had
grown steadily, he had worn very little.  He was incredibly
well-preserved&#8211;the palms of his three-fingered hands still sported the
deep, swirling ridges that had worn to nothing in most people before
they&#8217;d lived thirty years.  Indeed, all of the myriad folds and ridges
in his thick maroon skin were for the most part intact.  His eyes were
still housed in tight sockets, surrounded by thickly-ridged cheeks.
Besides the feet, the eyes were the greatest point of weakness for those
who aspired to read the works of the masters.  Ceaseless up-and-down eye
movement caused the sockets to wear out, and eventually the reader&#8217;s
eyes fell out.  At that point they were forced to trace the carved words
with their fingers.  Friction quickly took its toll on the hands;
readers rarely made it through one master&#8217;s teachings this way before
their hands were ground to the wrist, and they were finished.</i></p>

First appeared in Andromeda Spaceways Inflight Magazine, Issue #29.

There was no doubt that the femur was that of a modern human.  Not a proto-human, or some previously unknown dinosaur.  Joel and Renee had arrived at the same answer.  It was demonstrable, provable.  When they finally did release news of the discovery, people might argue about it, but they'd be unable to refute it.

But how did they answer the next question?  How did the bone come to be embedded in solid rock millions and millions of years before such a bone could have existed?

It had to be a time traveler.  There was no other answer.  Or was that just what he wanted to believe?

<p><i>Survivors isn&#8217;t exactly the word. What they found were sixteen bodies without arms, legs, and most organs. What remained were essentially heads hooked up to life support and fueled by oxygenated glucose pumps.  There were a couple hundred strands of glass fibre running from the ship&#8217;s walls into each skull, into each brain, into each soul. Four of the sixteen were still functioning&#8211;alive is not a word to describe their condition.</i></p>

<p><i>There was no hesitation on the part of Command.  They ordered everyone, except combat types like us, from the most likely targets.  Humanity couldn&#8217;t allow any more people to become components for the Shardie offense.</i></p>

<p><i>But civilians never listen.  Farmers were the worse, hanging onto their little plots and crops until somebody dragged them away, kicking and screaming at the injustice of it all.  That&#8217;s why we were here.  Forty settlers had stupidly refused to be evacuated from New Mars. Forty we didn&#8217;t know about until we got that one brief burst.</i></p>

<p><i>My mission was to make certain that they didn&#8217;t become forty armless, legless, gutless, screamless weapon components.</i></p>

<p><b>Rated R</b>.  Contains strong violence and heavy moral themes.</p>

There were a couple hundred strands of glass fibre running from the ship's walls into each skull, into each brain, into each soul. Four of the sixteen were still functioning--alive is not a word to describe their condition.

There was no hesitation on the part of Command.  They ordered everyone, except combat types like us, from the most likely targets.  Humanity couldn't allow any more people to become components for the Shardie offense.

But civilians never listen.  Farmers were the worse, hanging onto their little plots and crops until somebody dragged them away, kicking and screaming at the injustice of it all.  That's why we were here.  Forty settlers had stupidly refused to be evacuated from New Mars. Forty we didn't know about until we got that one brief burst.

My mission was to make certain that they didn't become forty armless, legless, gutless, screamless weapon components.

Rated R.  Contains strong violence and heavy moral themes.

He told me then of the antiquity and superiority of Martian

Tina tugs on Kindred's bullet-tattered red cape. "What kinda tricks do you do?"

Kindred shakes her head as if bewildered by the question. "Tricks?" She glances back at Megaton, who now juggles three Jersey barriers about a hundred meters out in the devastation.

"Let it go Kindred. We've been through a lot."

"Well that's good. So now you're free to put on a carnival. Get everyone together and onto the jet now. And I mean now!" Her voice is so loud it draws everyone's attention away from the show.

Megaton drops the Jersey barriers and the ground shakes.

Kindred lowers herself to one knee beside the little girl. "My trick is special," she says, "I can make the whole circus disappear. Abracadabrasbquo;Auml;icirc;"

Rated PG.  Contains superhero violence and organizational politics.

<p><i>She should have called her folks last night.  They paged her three separate times after the test.

Old enough to make her own mistakes.</i></p>

<p><i>Her parents thought the testing was mistake number one.  It certainly was expensive enough, but the doctor said he advised it for any couple about to get married. If they&#8217;re genetically incompatible, he&#8217;d said, they have the choice of terminating the relationship, planning for an expensive future, or tying tubes ‚Äî practicing irreversible infertility, as one of her friends called it.</i></p>

<p><i>Options.  That&#8217;s what her parents don&#8217;t get.  It&#8217;s all about options.</i></p>

Her parents thought the testing was mistake number one.  It certainly was expensive enough, but the doctor said he advised it for any couple about to get married. If they're genetically incompatible, he'd said, they have the choice of terminating the relationship, planning for an expensive future, or tying tubes sbquo;Auml;icirc; practicing irreversible infertility, as one of her friends called it.

Options.  That's what her parents don't get.  It's all about options.

And results.

Rated PG.  Contains serious themes involving family planning and childbearing.

The whole class cheers and Liona's smile doesn't leave her face for the rest of the evening.

Rated R.  Contains sexual innuendo, some strong language, and an R-rated bit of podcast feedback at the end.
