      <description>I should have mentioned this before, but time&amp;#8217;s been sneaking up on me:

I&amp;#8217;m going to be a guest at Dragon*Con this weekend in Atlanta, along with Mur, Michael &amp;#38; Evo, Derek,  and many other fun folks in the podcasting world.

      <ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I should have mentioned this before, but time&amp;#8217;s been sneaking up on me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to be a guest at &lt;a href="http://www.dragoncon.org"&gt;Dragon*Con&lt;/a&gt; this weekend in Atlanta, along with &lt;a href="http://www.geekfuactiongrip.com"&gt;Mur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.dragonpage.com"&gt;Michael &amp;amp; Evo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.skepticality.com"&gt;Derek&lt;/a&gt;,  and many other fun folks in the podcasting world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re all going to putting up a panel on podcasting in the Electronic Frontiers track, at the utterly insane time of &lt;b&gt;11:30 PM Friday&lt;/b&gt;.  Yeah, I know that&amp;#8217;s the time most people are hunting for bodypainted elves on the hotel party floors, but if you&amp;#8217;re around we promise our panel will be &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt; as much fun.  I&amp;#8217;m also running a panel for the Science track at &lt;b&gt;10 PM Sunday&lt;/b&gt; called &amp;#8220;Burn, Hollywood, Burn!&amp;#8221; and will be generally flitting around the rest of the time looking to socialize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I&amp;#8217;d like to do is have at least one lunch or bar meet-up with podcast listeners.  I don&amp;#8217;t have concrete plans yet, unfortunately, since I haven&amp;#8217;t scouted out the lay of the land.  But if you&amp;#8217;re going to be at D*C and you&amp;#8217;re so inclined, &lt;a href="sfeley@gmail.com"&gt;drop me a line&lt;/a&gt; with your contact info (preferably cellphone, and let me know if your phone can do SMS) and I&amp;#8217;ll give you mine, and if there&amp;#8217;s at least one of you we&amp;#8217;ll figure it out.  If there are several responses I&amp;#8217;ll actually organize a real event and post it here, so keep checking this space if you get a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks very much.  Next year we&amp;#8217;ll be a lot more organized about con presence: I&amp;#8217;m already making plans to hit &lt;a href="http://www.laconiv.com/"&gt;Worldcon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dragoncon.org"&gt;Dragon*Con&lt;/a&gt; in consecutive weeks on both coasts.  Meanwhile, I hope I&amp;#8217;ll get a chance to see some of you this weekend!&lt;/p&gt;</ns4:encoded>

Penguin listened raptly to the new voice.  He knew this was his guardian
angel, she who would guard and protect him forever.  Sure enough, the
Creator set him gently into his angel&amp;#8217;s hand.  Her hands, much smaller than
the Creator&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8211;which was fitting since who among the angels had such power
as the Creator?&amp;#8211;were a bit sticky.  He squealed as she held him aloft to
receive the glorious light.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Look, Daddy!  It&amp;#8217;s a peng&amp;#8217;n!&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Yes it is, Angie.  It&amp;#8217;s a very nice penguin.  Did you thank the nice man
for the balloon?&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains explicit existentialism and violence of the soul.  (The intro contains minor profanity and frank discussions of current events, and is likely to be more offensive than the story.)&lt;/p&gt;

you know it wasn&amp;#8217;t Grap&amp;#8217;s fault. It was just a little accident.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

My boyfriend ran in behind me, started the shower up, and tossed me into the freezing water.  But the fire continued to rage, despite the dousing.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;At that point, I realized that I wasn&amp;#8217;t actually in any pain.  I stepped out of the stream of water, teeth still chattering, and held my hand in the blue flames.  &amp;#8220;This should hurt,&amp;#8221; I said.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>As I just mentioned in the Metacast, we&amp;#8217;ve got the opportunity to give away some collectibles related to the Neil Gaiman movie Mirrormask, opening in limited release on September 30.

      <ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As I just mentioned in the &lt;a href="http://www.escapepod.info/2005/09/27/ep-metacast-1/"&gt;Metacast&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#8217;ve got the opportunity to give away some collectibles related to the Neil Gaiman movie &lt;a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/mirrormask/"&gt;Mirrormask&lt;/a&gt;, opening in limited release on September 30.  Not exactly sure yet what the stuff&amp;#8217;s going to be, but I was told &amp;#8220;Several large posters, a couple sets of action figures.&amp;#8221;  Works for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what can you do to win this stuff?  Just &lt;a href="mailto:editor@extraneous.org"&gt;drop me a line&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.escapepod.info/forum/viewforum.php?f=10"&gt;post in our forum&lt;/a&gt; with your personal answers to the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What was your favorite story on Escape Pod so far?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did you first hear about Escape Pod?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there anything you&amp;#8217;d like to see more of or less of?  Any new features you&amp;#8217;d like us to offer?  Anything we should do differently?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be honest.  Be creative.  After a couple of weeks (let&amp;#8217;s say Sunday, October 9) I&amp;#8217;ll randomly pick some of the people who responded and contact them for their addresses.  Not sure how much stuff we have to give away yet, so I can&amp;#8217;t tell you how many winners there will be.  But you&amp;#8217;ll be helping us make Escape Pod better, so it&amp;#8217;s worth it regardless.  Right?&lt;/p&gt;</ns4:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rufus didn&#8217;t relent. &#8220;How come you ain&#8217;t got a license, skillet face?&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shari struggled to keep her own distaste under control. Emotion could screw up the reading, her own pheromones and toxins clogging up the massive olfactory bulb and entorhinal cortex that occupied most of her cranium. She took a deep breath, pulling air through her huge nostrils, trying to calm herself. At least she didn&#8217;t have to see the man&#8217;s face.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains violence, profanity, and crimes against chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

Read by Evo Terra (of &lt;a href="http://www.dragonpage.com"&gt;The Dragon Page&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;On that last morning, anyone who came to visit me could see that I was dying.  I knew it myself.  As if I had cotton in my ears, I heard the voice of don Leandro saying to my wife, &amp;#8220;Dona Susana, I think it is time to fetch the priest,&amp;#8221; and I thought, yes, it&amp;#8217;s time.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We don&amp;#8217;t have our own priest, or even our own church, so someone has to drive in a pickup truck to get the priest from El Puentecito.  But don&amp;#8217;t be fooled by what you may hear in Malpasa or in Palpan de Baranda.  Here we remain Catholic.  Yes, we make pots in the old way.  That&amp;#8217;s why tourists come here.  And it&amp;#8217;s true, as is sometimes whispered, that we have restored certain other practices from the past.  But not as they were done back then.  Those were bloody and terrible times, the times of the Mejica.  They say that the sacrificial blood covered the sun pyramids from top to bottom.  Thank the Virgin, we don&amp;#8217;t do anything like that.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains death rituals with possible disturbing imagery, and numerous pot references.  (No, not that kind.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You need some younger Ast-tlakians for a new fantasy feature the company is doing. It&amp;#8217;s Lord of the Rings meets Kindergarten Cop. Vin Diesel to star, Woo to direct. So you need a bunch of realistic fantasy creatures, and Stan Winston figured out long ago that it was easier to hire off-world than build all these bizarre creatures from scratch. It&amp;#8217;s a big industry secret, and you need to keep it that way. You have a tendency to brag and name-drop when you&amp;#8217;re drunk, so you&amp;#8217;re only mostly sure that you haven&amp;#8217;t told anyone.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains sexual situations and a sleazy industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The new &lt;a href="http://podcasts.yahoo.com"&gt;Yahoo! Podcasts&lt;/a&gt; directory launched on Monday.  What&amp;#8217;s more, they&amp;#8217;ve chosen to feature Escape Pod as one of their &amp;#8220;New &amp;#038; Noteworthy&amp;#8221; podcasts for their debut week!  This is the first time we&amp;#8217;ve had prominent front-page status on any major podcast portal, and we&amp;#8217;re just tickled about it.  If it suits you, feel free to visit &lt;a href="http://podcasts.yahoo.com/series?s=7ba2408f95e9e6e8c6a29c763c044603"&gt;our page&lt;/a&gt; there and rate us or leave us a review.  And to everyone who just found us via Yahoo!, welcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had the pleasure of speaking with Mur Lafferty for her &lt;a href="http://shouldwrite.blogspot.com/2005/10/show-8-late-and-long.html"&gt;I Should Be Writing&lt;/a&gt; podcast, a resource specifically for beginning writers.  We had a good conversation, talking about Escape Pod, the &lt;a href="http://www.sff.net/paradise"&gt;Viable Paradise&lt;/a&gt; workshop, and perspectives on writing and persistence.  If you&amp;#8217;re writing and still working to get published, you really should be listening to Mur&amp;#8217;s show.  Check it out!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fan art!  FNH sent us this fun little piece from the &lt;i&gt;inside&lt;/i&gt; of our logo:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src='/media/thumb-EP_FanArt2.jpg' alt='Escape Pod Fan Art' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That&amp;#8217;s far too cool for me not to share it with you.&lt;/li&gt;

And of course it&amp;#8217;s Thursday, so we have a new podcast.  You&amp;#8217;ll find that right underneath these words.&lt;/ol&gt;</ns4:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When the floods came, all us kids climbed into bed and pulled the covers up over our heads while our parents rushed about trying to do something to stop it.  As the water level rose we could feel the beds lift off the floor, floating through our houses, bumping down our hallways and out our front doors.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We sat up in bed waved to one another as our beds merged onto the canal that now flowed between our houses.  We shrieked and giggled as our beds spun and bumped along with the swirling water.  Waves lapped at our boxsprings, but our covers were still warm and dry.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated G.&lt;/b&gt;  It&amp;#8217;s apocalyptic fantasy &amp;#8212; for kids!&lt;/p&gt;

as we&amp;#8217;re talking. I think I&amp;#8217;ll be fine, the piranhas are still 5 or 6

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;All right, but isn&amp;#8217;t our conversation going to distract you?&amp;#8221; I
asked. &amp;#8220;I know you&amp;#8217;re upset, but wouldn&amp;#8217;t you rather call back at
another time?&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;d really like to talk about it, Doc. I always find talking to you
clears my mind and makes me more effective. I may need to go if the
henchmen come back, though.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;As you are no doubt aware, I am the issue of solid Dutch stock&#8212;the prosperous Van Pelt family of St. Paul. Mine was a comfortable and happy childhood, and I spent much of it in the devoted service of the Great Old Pumpkin. For him, I cultivated an annual pumpkin patch. I also evangelized him in the community, relating the tale of how, every year on Hallowmas Eve, the day when the spiritual most strongly encroaches on the substantial, this mightiest of gourds would rise to revel across the world with the most sincere of his adorers. My neighbors were understandably skeptical; after all, not once had this superbeing ever chosen to grace my pumpkin patch or any other place in our town. I vowed that I would coax him into my backyard, and I set out in the manner of a learned man to discover how I might do this.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains dark imagery and terrifying fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Go to hell, idiot,&amp;#8221; I said, using an astringent tongue he&amp;#8217;d understand. &amp;#8220;I
am but a monumental slab of granite, and you, mortality, are like one of
the droppings of a fairly large corpulent deity&amp;#8211;an ephemeral honor I would
rather pass me by.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;And yet, you speak to me, mountain,&amp;#8221; said the mote of humanity. &amp;#8220;Why is
that?&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I considered that for a moment.  The creature had a point.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t know,&amp;#8221; I replied honestly.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;That might seem funny to those who&amp;#8217;ve ever bothered to attend these performances, to say that someone didn&amp;#8217;t belong.  The audience is always a motley sort&amp;#8211;faculty and spouses, local musicians and artists, music students and jocks who have to attend so many of these things to get credit for required courses, waitresses and office workers desperate for some culture, their school-age children (alternately awed and bored to tears), homeless folks who need a warm place to sleep for a couple of hours, mentally and physically handicapped folks hauled out as someone&amp;#8217;s idea of a good deed, and, of course, recreational drug users with nothing better to do.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Still, he didn&amp;#8217;t belong.  He was Gothic.  Not like those kids who hang out at Hot Topic and think wearing black nail polish expresses their inner turmoil, their eternal angst.  I&amp;#8217;d seen Goths there before and he wasn&amp;#8217;t Goth, he was Gothic&amp;#8211;dark and looming, faintly chivalrous in manner, seemingly possessed of a great, tragic secret.  I thought of Bronte&amp;#8217;s Heathcliff.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains drug use, some profanity, and codependent creatures of darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A Poem by Tim Pratt.
Read by Stephen Eley.

He is the reason clowns so often seem
sinister, the reason mannequins and dolls
can be so unsettling, the reason a child&amp;#8217;s
tricycle
sitting unattended in a front yard can be an image
suffused with dread. If he goes on
this way, who knows what other objects
will attain an aura of menace?

      <ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned recently on the podcast, Escape Pod just reached its  six-month anniversary.  Since May of this year we&amp;#8217;ve enjoyed  tremendous success, with thousands of listeners worldwide and new fun  stories every week.  We&amp;#8217;re now reported to be the largest source of  free audio fiction on the Internet, and of course we&amp;#8217;re still growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help us celebrate, Jesse Willis of the &lt;a href="http://www.sffaudio.com"&gt;SFFAudio.com&lt;/a&gt; review site  has helped us to design and produce a collectible MP3 CD containing every  audio file we&amp;#8217;ve podcast in the first six months.  These CDs are  produced using the &lt;a href="http://www.lightscribe.com"&gt;LightScribe&lt;/a&gt; labeling technology, which burns an  image directly to the front side of the disc, allowing us to number  and put a customized inscription on each disc.  An example of the CD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.escapepod.org/wp-images/EP_Collection1.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re offering these CDs as a special reward for anyone who donates $20 or more to Escape Pod between now and January 31, 2006 &amp;#8212; or until we&amp;#8217;ve made 200 of them, whichever comes first.  You can keep it for yourself, to catch up  on our archives, or inscribe it as a gift for somebody else and have it sent to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want one?  All you have to do is include the following information in the comments field of your donation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The name of the recipient (yourself or anyone else)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The address of the recipient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any personal message you&amp;#8217;d like inscribed on the edge of the CD, up  to about 60 characters or so.  (There&amp;#8217;s no absolute limit, but the  longer the text the more we&amp;#8217;ll have to shrink the font.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s worth noting that, in accordance with Escape Pod&amp;#8217;s values, the  &lt;em&gt;contents&lt;/em&gt; of the CD are all Creative Commons-licensed and can be  freely copied for all your friends.  However, the front of the disc  is absolutely unique, and cannot be easily duplicated.  I&amp;#8217;d like to  think that someday these CDs will have collectible value, just as old  science fiction magazines have value today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all of you for your support!&lt;/p&gt;</ns4:encoded>

Yeah, that&#8217;s it. Oh, that&#8217;s nice. You&#8217;ve got strong hands, Mister. Are you psychic? Maybe just a little? No? Well, I can fix that.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I paused to tie a loose shoelace and a squat robot, like a dirty white trashcan on tank-treads, trundled out of an alley toward me.

I paused to tie a loose shoelace and a squat robot, like a dirty white trashcan on tank-treads, trundled out of an alley toward me. A red light on top of its domelike top blinked erratically. It said, in a high-pitched voice, &#8220;Klaatu barada nikto.&#8221; A small panel slid open in its front, and a pole with a cup on the end telescoped out. There were a few coins in the cup, mostly pennies and nickels, and the robot jingled the cup significantly.

&#8220;Take me to your leader,&#8221; I said, wishing it could be that simple, knowing that these things are never that simple.  The robot beeped at me and jingled its cup harder, the coins rattling. 

&#8220;It won&#8217;t go away unless you give it some change,&#8221; said a woman standing on the corner. &#8220;It followed me all the way to work one day, and hung around outside the door like a dog for hours.&#8221;

Rated PG.  Contains slight profanity, long flirtations, and excessive Zen.  Watch for falling metaphors.

      <ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As I just mentioned in &lt;a href="http://www.escapepod.org/2005/12/08/ep031-robots-and-falling-hearts/"&gt;today&amp;#8217;s podcast&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#8217;re conducting a brief listener survey:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.podtrac.com/audience/start-survey.aspx?ver=1&amp;amp;pid=oahiG5aimVY$"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.podtrac.com/podcaster/images/survey/podtrac_survey_120x120_v1.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should you fill it out?  Because it&amp;#8217;ll help us understand how we&amp;#8217;re doing, what you like and what you don&amp;#8217;t, who listens to us, and it might help us in the future with grants or funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also because I&amp;#8217;m giving $1 to Penny Arcade&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org"&gt;Child&amp;#8217;s Play&lt;/a&gt; for each completed survey.  Click some boxes, help a kid.  How good a deal is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/b&gt; Janice&amp;#8217;s comment (thanks!) made me understand that I probably ought to be a lot clearer about my intent with this.  Yes, the survey was composed by a marketing company.  &lt;i&gt;Their&lt;/i&gt; intent with it, I think, was to help podcasters prepare a pitch to advertisers.  That is not &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; intent with it.  We seriously are doing better with donations right now than I think we&amp;#8217;d be likely to do running ads, and I know as well as anyone that if we started running commercials the donations would probably drop to nothing overnight.  I don&amp;#8217;t want to do that.  You all have been incredible in your support, and I want to redeem that trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason we&amp;#8217;re using this survey (despite some annoying questions) is because it was free and ready-made, and that saves us a lot of time.  Also, we &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; want to prepare a pitch &amp;#8212; but not to advertisers.  I&amp;#8217;m hoping that some of this information will be useful in our application to the IRS for 501(c)(3) status, and later on if we decide to go looking for public arts grants or ad-free sponsorships.  And some of this stuff we&amp;#8217;d simply like to know.  I&amp;#8217;m far more interested in the questions like &amp;#8220;What do you think of the Web design/show length/frequency?&amp;#8221; than &amp;#8220;How much would you trust this host to recommend real estate products?&amp;#8221;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find those questions obnoxious, just skip them.  I can&amp;#8217;t really can&amp;#8217;t blame you.  Heck, I&amp;#8217;m not sure &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; would trust me to recommend real estate products.  If you would, you haven&amp;#8217;t seen my lawn.&lt;/p&gt;</ns4:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Some friends and me heard that if you smoked the skin of an aret, you could get monumentally wasted. So we bought one at a pet store and waited a couple of weeks until it shed its skin. Then we crumbled up the dry skin, put it in with some pot, and lit up. We all got these insane mouth blisters that didn&amp;#8217;t go away for weeks. We all had to eat soup for a month. Though maybe it wasn&amp;#8217;t the skin; the pot could have been bad or something.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains profanity, explicit imagery, and hot alien action.&lt;/p&gt;

Friday I had the incredible opportunity to have dinner with &lt;a href="http://www.oneamericacommittee.com/"&gt;Senator John Edwards&lt;/a&gt; and his wife Elizabeth.  (They have their own podcast and videoblog &amp;#8212; and yes, I&amp;#8217;m a subscriber.)    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was busy literally all day Saturday, from presenting a morning &amp;#8220;How to Podcast&amp;#8221; seminar with &lt;a href="http://www.podcast411.com"&gt;Rob Walch&lt;/a&gt; to a midnight podcast-and-beer in &lt;a href="http://www.addcast.net/"&gt;Paul Fischer&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; hotel room.  To everyone I met there, thanks for an incredible time and some of the best conversations I&amp;#8217;ve had all year.  (By which I mean &amp;#8220;last 365 days,&amp;#8221; not 2006.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you weren&amp;#8217;t there and you want to &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; what you missed, the fine folks at &lt;a href="http://www.macpropodcast.com"&gt;Mac Pro Podcast&lt;/a&gt; have put together an excellent 12-minute video summarizing the con.  They&amp;#8217;ve got a number of great interviews in there &amp;#8212; and if any of you wanted to know what I look like, here&amp;#8217;s your chance.  (They say the camera adds 20 pounds&amp;#8230;  Alas, I was in it twice, so it must have added 40 to me.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video is &lt;a href="http://www.macpropodcast.com/2006/01/mac-pro-podcast-19-special.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Check it out, and see how much fun you&amp;#8217;ll have if you come &lt;i&gt;next&lt;/i&gt; year!&lt;/p&gt;</ns4:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;But, Connie, we said, that doesn&amp;#8217;t make sense.  If you were a duplicate
you wouldn&amp;#8217;t say a thing like that.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Connie shook his head.  &amp;#8220;The aliens destroyed my body while they were
doing their tests and experiments and what not and they had to make a new
one so no one would know about them.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;So they destroyed everything, we asked, except your brain?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Read by Wichita Rutherford (of 5 Minutes With Wichita).

Conrad McManus claimed he was kidnaped by aliens and replaced by an
exact duplicate of himself.

But, Connie, we said, that doesn&#8217;t make sense.  If you were a duplicate
you wouldn&#8217;t say a thing like that.

Connie shook his head.  &#8220;The aliens destroyed my body while they were
doing their tests and experiments and what not and they had to make a new
one so no one would know about them.&#8221;

So they destroyed everything, we asked, except your brain?

&#8220;No,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;They destroyed my brain, too.&#8221;

Rated G.  Contains alien abduction, brainwashing, and conspiracy.  Unless it doesn&#8217;t.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know how it happened.  I&amp;#8217;m the last person I&amp;#8217;d go to if I were a
zombie; I&amp;#8217;m not into the occult thing at all.  But I was the only friend
Mandy had in this city, so she came to me with her sob story.  Lucky me.  So
there she was, kicked back in my bed, having herself a good, long cry and I
was stuck with her, wondering how long until she began stinking.  That was
really unfair of me, I know, but there was a goddamn walking, talking corpse
snuggled up in my good sheets and I was a little concerned about it.
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated X&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains profanity, sexual situations, and the undead, in various combinations.&lt;/p&gt;

Read by the Word Whore (of Air Out My Shorts).

I don&#8217;t know how it happened.  I&#8217;m the last person I&#8217;d go to if I were a
zombie; I&#8217;m not into the occult thing at all.  But I was the only friend
Mandy had in this city, so she came to me with her sob story.  Lucky me.  So
there she was, kicked back in my bed, having herself a good, long cry and I
was stuck with her, wondering how long until she began stinking.  That was
really unfair of me, I know, but there was a goddamn walking, talking corpse
snuggled up in my good sheets and I was a little concerned about it.


Rated X.  Contains profanity, sexual situations, and the undead, in various combinations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;         The only person who might understand is Sponheim, the Corrections
Sociologist.  He just arrived.  It&amp;#8217;s his job to understand me thoroughly
and to write a report that his successors will use to decide if it&amp;#8217;s safe
to revive me.  His report will help them decide if I am no longer a threat
to society because society has changed enough to deal with me, or has
learned to treat behaviors like mine.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;         &amp;#8220;I am already remorseful!&amp;#8221; I tell him at our first interview.  &amp;#8220;I
won&amp;#8217;t do it again!&amp;#8221;  We are sitting at a table by the water.  A light mist
falls.  &amp;#8220;I shouldn&amp;#8217;t have done it, shouldn&amp;#8217;t even have thought about
it.  Once, I was one of the people fighting to preserve the last wild polar
bears!  I wanted to protect the earth!&amp;#8221;  I get myself worked up.  I am
close to tears.
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains themes of ecoterrorism and global disaster.  If you can explain that to your kids, it&amp;#8217;s family-safe.&lt;/p&gt;

to try it. About two minutes ago. 

Rated G.  Kids, don&#8217;t try this at home.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The first thing I want you to know is that I drowned those kittens for a reason.  Villains rarely do anything without purpose, and I&amp;#8217;m no exception, to that or any other rule.  Irrational, passionate acts are for heroes, with their bright armor and their grand ideas, their conviction that with enough heart they can right any wrong, unravel any curse.  My dragons were once well-fed on their kind, and their skulls still decorate the spikes above my gates.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Fictional animals were harmed in the making of this podcast.  Also knights, damsels, dragons, and medieval economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;At home, Little Worker could do pretty much as she pleased, as long as she was there should Mister Michael need her.  At the office&amp;#8211;and in other public places&amp;#8211;she had to be more circumspect and diligent.  Little Worker was on duty her, in a way that was more intense than behind the electrified fence and active sensors of the estate.  (Once, one of the men at the Training School had said: &amp;#8220;Little Worker, you are the most diligent companion I&amp;#8217;ve ever trained.&amp;#8221;  The men of the school had been nice, in their stern way.  But no one was like Mister Michael.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Today, however, Little Worker&amp;#8217;s mind was not on her work.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated X&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains sex, violence, domestic slavery, and furries you don&amp;#8217;t want to mess with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dex asks if he can keep the bullet, and Brindi says to give it back, and Teacher reminds her to say please. Brindi agrees to throw bullets at the rest of us, so she does the thing with her finger and it&amp;#8217;s BOOM, BOOM, BOOM and whip-whip-whip for the next few minutes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When she&amp;#8217;s done there&amp;#8217;s smoke in the air and it stinks and we applaud and give back her bullets. Brindi has had a great show, and I don&amp;#8217;t know how anyone can beat it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Show and Tell is important because it prepares us to be impressive.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains mild scenes of violence enacted by somewhat strange children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;    Missy downshifted as she pulled into the median of the interstate to avoid the state troopers and the mess of traffic-snarled cars attempting to leave the coast too late.  I tried not to look at the panicked faces inside the cars, lit by the headlights of those behind them.  All waiting to escape the storm.  Just like us, but powerless to move &amp;#8212; to phase, if needed &amp;#8212; the way we did.  Sucking on the cigarette, I slid lower onto the wornout springs of the back seat.  Slowly I pulled my gaze away from those we were leaving behind.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;    One thing I learned from Oklahoma: if I thought about the people too much, I&amp;#8217;d be worthless.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains graphic violent imagery, intense themes of natural and man-made disasters, and incidental profanity.  Not one of our lighter stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;She had been wondering if she should start her own poetry business. She believed Milwaukee might need a poet for hire to spread the magic of verse around the town. Sometimes, in her current job as a medical secretary, she secretly wrote poems for especially ill patients. They got well, and Verity felt certain the focused mental energy from the poems helped them. She wanted to write poetry full-time to spread its energy to more people &amp;#8212; to become the city&amp;#8217;s first commercial free-lance poet.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;     They are a quick lot, these humans.  They dart about, rushing here, there, everywhere, as if

them, the fact that I have come to eat one of them automatically makes me a monster.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Hell, it took me almost a year before any of them would even speak to me, and I didn&#8217;t try to razzle-dazzle them.&#8221; She quickly scanned the list and produced folders matching each name. &#8220;Here,&#8221; she said and slid them across the desk, &#8220;but they won&#8217;t go with you.&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Union tries very hard to get all Supers to sign on and become active members, but some simply won&amp;#8217;t.  This is the first Village, and already The Union is constructing others. Either the mutation rate is rising among the Normals, or we&amp;#8217;re getting better at ferreting them out.  Either way, we need more space.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Finally Nicholas summoned his overseers and all other servants who were mobile to his chamber.  &#226;??You are merely robots,&#226;?? Nicholas said, &#226;??but I know you are not stupid.  Doubtless during my withdrawal you laid plans to snare me again, to draw me against my will into a plot for my own happiness.&#226;??&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#226;??Harshly said, sir,&#226;?? said the Overseer of Planning, &#226;??but essentially correct.  We have found a young lady with whom we feel you will establish a more-than-satisfactory rapport, and taken measures to ensure that you shall not avoid her.&#226;??&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains killer robots, incidental violence, and love looked for in all the wrong places.&lt;/p&gt;

Read by Paul Jenkins.

Finally Nicholas summoned his overseers and all other servants who were mobile to his chamber.  &#226;??You are merely robots,&#226;?? Nicholas said, &#226;??but I know you are not stupid.  Doubtless during my withdrawal you laid plans to snare me again, to draw me against my will into a plot for my own happiness.&#226;??

&#226;??Harshly said, sir,&#226;?? said the Overseer of Planning, &#226;??but essentially correct.  We have found a young lady with whom we feel you will establish a more-than-satisfactory rapport, and taken measures to ensure that you shall not avoid her.&#226;??

Rated PG.  Contains killer robots, incidental violence, and love looked for in all the wrong places.

If you missed the podcast (shame on you, it was fantastic) then you can still get it for free through e-book (you can still download all the chapters through podcast, if you want to hear Jim&amp;#8217;s voice telling the story in his compelling way.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;We will be recording the next &amp;#8220;Cover to Cover&amp;#8221; feature on Saturday, May 13th, beginning at 10:30am Pacific Time.

What makes this different is that we&amp;#8217;ll be talking with 3 authors from Edge Publications, and you&amp;#8217;ll be able to call in with questions and comments during and after their roundtable discussion.

Rebecca Rowe (&amp;#8221;Forbidden Cargo&amp;#8221;), Lynda Williams (&amp;#8221;Courtesan Prince&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Throne Prince&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Righteous Anger&amp;#8221;), and Australian author and Borealis winner K.A. Bedford (&amp;#8221;Orbital&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Eclipse&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Hydrogen Steel&amp;#8221;) will be talking about their books, all of which have something to do with genetic modification and the use of nanotechnology in humans.

Listeners will be able to hear the feed here:
&lt;a href="http://haven.homelinux.net:12346/listen.pls"&gt;http://haven.homelinux.net:12346/listen.pls&lt;/a&gt;

Australian listeners can catch a feed closer to home:
&lt;a href="http://stream.froosh.net:8000/wingin_it.m3u"&gt;http://stream.froosh.net:8000/wingin_it.m3u&lt;/a&gt;

We are in the process of adding another server, so keep an eye out here, and in the new IRC channel #dragonpage for more news.

Both IRC channels #dragonpage and #wingin_it are available at irc.freenode.net&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave it to Michael and Evo and the Kick Ass Mystic Ninjas to fiddle with the possibilities of the awesomeness of podcasting. If you&amp;#8217;ve got some time Saturday, check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

Just a quick heads-up that due to a last minute technical issue (that I&amp;#8217;m too annoyed at myself to describe), today&amp;#8217;s Escape Pod will be posted sometime this afternoon.

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our official release schedule is &amp;#8220;Sometime Thursday,&amp;#8221; so strictly speaking this doesn&amp;#8217;t make us late.  However, I know that many of you are used to getting the files in the morning, and for those of you who&amp;#8217;ll miss having it for these few hours, I apologize.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all goes well it&amp;#8217;ll be the first of our Hugo nominees, so hopefully it&amp;#8217;ll be worth the wait.  And my new job schedule &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; mean this is the last time I stay up this late to get things done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your understanding!&lt;/p&gt;

Fanfic has been looked down upon for years - it&amp;#8217;s a copyright violation (which is true), it&amp;#8217;s not &amp;#8220;real writing&amp;#8221; (not quite so true), it takes no skill (untrue) and there&amp;#8217;s a lot of crap out there (true of any art). The other side, well, they just argue the opposite. I (2) realized that there&amp;#8217;s a fine line - if someone hires you to write, it&amp;#8217;s no longer fanfic. But what&amp;#8217;s the difference between a Star Wars fanfic and a Star Wars novel? Money, licensing, permission, and perhaps skill. I write professional fanfic when I write in established RPG worlds. I&amp;#8217;ve written World of Warcraft fanfic and Exalted fanfic, technically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the sticky situation comes up when you realize if the piece had won, then the author would have received things such as chocolate, a trip to the award ceremony at WisCon, and&amp;#8230; money. That&amp;#8217;s right. The author would have received money, making the &amp;#8220;homage&amp;#8221; copyright violation (something that&amp;#8217;s usually accepted online) into a definite illegal commercial copyright violation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are questioning the credibility of the judges, as fanfic isn&amp;#8217;t even considered &amp;#8220;published&amp;#8221;, was the piece good enough, should it be judged on writing or just gender exploration, etc. It&amp;#8217;s an interesting situation. I have to admit that my opinion of fanfic has changed in the past years, but I&amp;#8217;m still firmly in the camp that it should be seen as a hobby that hones writing skill and is fun to do, not something you can publish, no matter how good it is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;[EDIT- response from Debbie Notkin, chair of the Tiptree motherboard in the comments.]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://boingboing.net"&gt;BoingBoing&lt;/a&gt; recently broke &lt;a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/05/22/u_florida_cops_ask_f.html"&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt;, which is something anyone who is interested in genre fiction needs to take interest in. A University of Florida graduate student wrote a horror story on his LiveJournal which got the interest of the university police. They have been harassing him for his fingerprints and DNA so they can try to match him to other murders. The unstoppable force that is Cory Doctorow got involved, calling and investigating, with the police quite unwilling to discuss the situation, although they chose to use Doctorow&amp;#8217;s interest in the situation as more ammo with which to threaten the student. There is no case. There are no charges. And yet they won&amp;#8217;t lay off this guy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing is not a crime. Writing about bad things is not a crime. Being an unpublished writer, writing about bad things, is not a crime. (Notice no one going after big time authors.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news. &lt;a href="http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?id=36225"&gt;SciFi Wire&lt;/a&gt; reports that Dabel Brothers Productions will start adapting some popular SFF novels to graphic novels. If they do it half as well as Mike Carey and Glenn Fabry are depicting Neil Gaiman&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dccomics.com/comics/?cm=5050"&gt;Neverwhere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, look to see some good stuff. The first three titles up will be Orson Scott Card&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Red Prophet&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wyrms&lt;/em&gt; and Laurel K. Hamilton&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Anita Blake&lt;/em&gt; book, &lt;em&gt;Guilty Pleasures&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[EDIT- these are not the first titles, these are the first of a new batch. They&amp;#8217;ve been doing this with other titles already. Thanks for the comment, John!]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The machines did not look made by sorcery.  They were entirely silent, looking like rows of gigantic, rusted steel chess pawns twice the height of a man, with no pipes or wires entering or leaving them, apparently sitting here unused for any purpose.  Mativi felt an urgent, entirely rational need to be in an another line of employment.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains profanity and some violence. &lt;/p&gt;

Read by Dr. Jonathon Sullivan.

The wind in here was deafening.  The girl had to shout.  &#8220;THERE IS MORE THAN ONE IN HERE.  THEY LIVE IN THE MACHINES.  THE GOVERNMENT MADE THE MACHINES, BUT NOT WITH TECHNICIANS AND ELECTRICIANS.  WITH SORCERY.&#8221;

The machines did not look made by sorcery.  They were entirely silent, looking like rows of gigantic, rusted steel chess pawns twice the height of a man, with no pipes or wires entering or leaving them, apparently sitting here unused for any purpose.  Mativi felt an urgent, entirely rational need to be in an another line of employment.

Rated R.  Contains profanity and some violence.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Generally speaking, I need only three minutes of concentrated attention to kill someone by staring at them.  If I&amp;#8217;m feeling under the weather, or my mind is preoccupied with other matters&amp;#8211;you know how your mind can obsess about trivial things sometimes&amp;#8211;it might take five minutes for my power to have its effect.  On the other hand, if I focus intensely on my victim I can get the job done in as little as ninety seconds.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8230;Now the nation is at war.  Or so we&amp;#8217;re told.  I guess that changes everything.  A person like me becomes much more important.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the center of the room, on a platform, was our Dokja&amp;#8211;not the humanoid body she took in VR, but a blue mass of flesh with dry fish-like skin that pulsated as she breathed.  She had no definitive shape, no arms or legs or tentacles, or even a face.  Her only prominent feature was a taut membrane stretched tightly over an opening at the top of her body.  One section of that membrane was covered over with an elaborate breathing apparatus, and the familiar array of VR electrodes were attached to what must have been her central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Well, the time came Paul Bunyan had a pretty successful thing going with his lumber business.  Fact is, the first year his company went public, the stock price doubled, and it went up fifty percent each of the three years after that.  Mind you, this made Paul a target for corporate raiders.  Why, the battle he had with Bluebeard is a yarn and a half&amp;#8211;but that&#8217;s another tale.  &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is the story of what happened when Paul Bunyan&#8217;s secretary went on vacation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated G.&lt;/b&gt;  Objects in story may be larger than they appear.&lt;/p&gt;

Why, the battle he had with Bluebeard is a yarn and a half&#8211;but that&#8217;s another tale.  This is the story of what happened when Paul Bunyan&#8217;s secretary went on vacation.

Rated G.  Objects in story may be larger than they appear.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;But, Morty, I&amp;#8217;m an alien.  Christ, I&amp;#8217;m The Alien, the only one on the whole damned planet. 
There&amp;#8217;s got to be something.&amp;#8221;  It occurred to me that my apartment was too big.  It seemed to be
getting bigger every day.  And when I considered the rent&lt;/i&gt; vis a vis &lt;i&gt;my bank account balance, the
place was huge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;The novelty&amp;#8217;s worn off, kiddo.  I&amp;#8217;m surprised it lasted for four movies.  And that last one
didn&amp;#8217;t really count, just a walk-on in a dream sequence.  The point is, people aren&amp;#8217;t going to keep
paying to see something they&amp;#8217;ve already seen, even if he is an alien.  I mean, it&amp;#8217;s not like you do
anything.  You&amp;#8217;re just there, you know?&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains minor innuendo, minor swearing, and some grotesque imagery.  No livestock were harmed in the making of this podcast. &lt;/p&gt;

Read by Matthew Wayne Selznick (of &lt;a href="http://www.bravemenrun.com/"&gt;Brave Men Run&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When Jerry walked out across his lawn to catch the morning bus to Effendale High, he stopped to admire the new car Mr. Atkinson had growing in his lawn. Jerry could see the doors stretching up towards the roof, small branches of metal trying to reach their stringy edges up and around the rough frame. It looked like a regular car had melted, but in reverse. Every day Jerry stepped out, he could see more of the car&amp;#8217;s gray paneling filling in around the rough frame. Mr. Atkinson tended towards planting larger luxury cars, like any other retired old man. The half-finished Caddilac sat in between the rose bushes and posies that Mrs. Atkinson cared for. Both car and bushes glinted with a fresh coating of morning dew.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains profanity and adolescence.  (Wait, that&amp;#8217;s redundant.) &lt;/p&gt;

Warm, fertilized eggs, likely ripped just that day from the hatching burrow of some poor herder family. It had been the greatest challenge the Creator had ever sent him. His fangs had unfolded without his conscious will, and only a lifetime of piety and self-control had kept him from sinking them into the small bodies of the terrified guards.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;His venom had dripped onto the filthy floor, and after the guards left he had lain shuddering in the dampness, feeling the leathery eggs by his flank gradually cool and die. Over and over he repeated the litany of the Prophet: &amp;#8220;People shall not sink fang into other speaking people. People shall not eat the flesh of other speaking people. People shall not make war&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains slavery, heavy moral themes, and some violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;After ascending 72 flights of iron stairs, creeping past tentacled sentinels lurking in pools filled with black water, and silently dispatching wizened old warriors armed with glaives and morningstars that proved a close match for his pistols and poisoned glass knives, Mr. Zealand at last stumbled into the uppermost room of Archibald Grace&amp;#8217;s invisible tower. All Zealand&amp;#8217;s earlier murders were mere journeyman work compared to this final assassination, the murder of a man who&amp;#8217;d lived for untold centuries, who&amp;#8217;d come to America and enslaved Buffalo spirits, who&amp;#8217;d built this tower of ice and iron on the far side of the Rockies as a sanctuary and stronghold for his own precious life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;One of the governor&amp;#8217;s advisers had recommended appointing a committee of science fiction writers to investigate the saucer sightings as a way of diverting the public, and the governor had agreed. However, as none of the selection committee were SF readers, Project Birdwatch was dominated by screenwriters, writer-directors, writer-director-producers, and the occasional typecast actor. Few of them were brilliant, but they knew one side of a television camera from the other, and at least none of them had been blacklisted. The novelists and short story writers who had joined Birdwatch had soon given up in disgust. Ed had signed up for the same reasons as most of the others; the possibility of publicity, and the badly-needed fifty dollars a month. Besides, seven pretty blonde women had been abducted, and &lt;b&gt;someone was responsible!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains profanity, brief scenes of graphic violence, and questionable filmmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Squonk lived with his mother, who was definitely &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; a dragon&amp;#8211;she was a small blue bird named Mrs. Tweedle-Chirp.  Now, it is true that birds generally cannot lay dragon eggs, and Mrs. Tweedle-Chirp was no exception.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eve looked startled. &#8220;You used to be in Heaven? And now you&#8217;re working for the Lord of Flies?&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#8220;He don&#8217;t go by that title no more. He didn&#8217;t like the novel, thought it showed him in a bad light. And don&#8217;t call him &#8216;Beelzebub,&#8217; neither,&#8221; I advised, figuring it wouldn&#8217;t hurt to give these underdressed kids a little help. &#8220;He&#8217;s gotten real sensitive about it. He thinks it makes him sound like a character in an English comedy.&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains religious satire, gangster satire, and profanity.  Not for those who take their hellfire too seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

Read by Evo Terra (of The Dragon Page) and Sheila Unwin (of The Dragon Page With Class).

Eve looked startled. &#8220;You used to be in Heaven? And now you&#8217;re working for the Lord of Flies?&#8221;

&#8220;He don&#8217;t go by that title no more. He didn&#8217;t like the novel, thought it showed him in a bad light. And don&#8217;t call him &#8216;Beelzebub,&#8217; neither,&#8221; I advised, figuring it wouldn&#8217;t hurt to give these underdressed kids a little help. &#8220;He&#8217;s gotten real sensitive about it. He thinks it makes him sound like a character in an English comedy.&#8221;

Rated R.  Contains religious satire, gangster satire, and profanity.  Not for those who take their hellfire too seriously.

I had requested permission to play Janis Ian&amp;#8217;s song, &amp;#8220;God and the FBI,&amp;#8221; but she was touring Europe and didn&amp;#8217;t get my e-mail in time.  She just responded and graciously gave me permission, so I&amp;#8217;m revising the file and including it at the end.  If you don&amp;#8217;t want to hear the whole story again, just skip forward 41 minutes.  Thank you, Janis!)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sfsite.com/~silverag/turtledove.html"&gt;By Harry Turtledove.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(Inspired by the song &amp;#8220;God &amp;amp; the FBI&amp;#8221; by &lt;a href="http://www.janisian.com/"&gt;Janis Ian&lt;/a&gt;, published by Windham Hill.  Song included with Janis Ian&amp;#8217;s permission.)&lt;br /&gt;
Read by Stephen Eley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Two men left.  Franklin D. Roosevelt.  D for Delano, mind.  Governor of New York.  Cousin to Teddy Roosevelt.  Already ran for Vice President once.  Didn&amp;#8217;t win.  Cigarette holder.  Jaunty angle.  Wheelchair.  Paralysis.  Anguish.  Courage.  As near an aristocrat as America grows.  Franklin D. Roosevelt.  D for Delano.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;And Joe Steele.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joe Steele.  Congressman from California.  Not San Francisco.  Not Nob Hill.  Good Lord, no.  Fresno.  Farm country.  That great valley, squeezed by mountains east and west.  Not a big fellow, Joe Steele.  Stands real straight, so you don&amp;#8217;t notice too much.  Mustache, a good-sized one.  Thick head of hair just starting to go gray.  Eyelids like shutters.  When they go down and then come up again, you can&amp;#8217;t see what was behind them.
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains profanity and strong political themes.  Not happy politics, like we have today.  1930s politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&#8220;I like the taste of home-grown tomatoes,&#8221; I tell him.  &#8220;Ones at the Safeway taste like wallpaper.&#8221;

&#8220;But nano won&#8217;t make tomatoes that taste processed,&#8221; he says in that way that men like to correct women.  &#8220;That machinery will make the best tomatoes this town ever tasted.&#8221;

&#8220;Well, I hope you&#8217;re right.&#8221;  Then Will and Kimee spilled their fight out through the screen door into the back yard, and Jackie started whimpering on his blanket, and I didn&#8217;t have no time for any nanomachinery.

Rated R.  Contains violence, brief sexual violence, and minor profanity.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I smiled. &#8220;Only some of you - you, for example. You&#8217;re much too beautiful to be human, but you could be a cat, a flower, a tree - no, scratch that one, you&#8217;re too short.&#8221; I glanced at Hiroshi. &#8220;Maybe Shimako&#8217;s the tree-spirit,&#8221; I said, softly. Hiroshi ignored me, but Miyume covered her mouth and laughed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#8220;I assure you, I&#8217;m quite human,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt that Shimako is, too. And how many girls have you used that line on, before?&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;. Contains explicit sexual content. And ghosts. Explicit sexual ghosts, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The &lt;/i&gt;Pioneer Spirit&lt;i&gt; was a colonization ship; it wasn&#8217;t intended as a diplomatic vessel. When it had left Earth, it had seemed important to get at least some humans off the mother world. Two small-scale nuclear wars&#8212;Nuke I and Nuke II, as the media had dubbed them&#8212;had already been fought, one in southern Asia, the other in South America. It appeared to be only a matter of time before Nuke III, and that one might be the big one.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;SETI had detected nothing from Tau Ceti, at least not by 2051. But Earth itself had only been broadcasting for a century and a half at that point; Tau Ceti might have had a thriving civilization then that hadn&#8217;t yet started using radio. But now it was twelve hundred years later. Who knew how advanced the Tau Cetians might be?
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains minor profanity, and very tame references to populating new worlds.  Hey, someone&amp;#8217;s got to.&lt;/p&gt;

The Pioneer Spirit was a colonization ship; it wasn&#8217;t intended as a diplomatic vessel. When it had left Earth, it had seemed important to get at least some humans off the mother world. Two small-scale nuclear wars&#8212;Nuke I and Nuke II, as the media had dubbed them&#8212;had already been fought, one in southern Asia, the other in South America. It appeared to be only a matter of time before Nuke III, and that one might be the big one.

SETI had detected nothing from Tau Ceti, at least not by 2051. But Earth itself had only been broadcasting for a century and a half at that point; Tau Ceti might have had a thriving civilization then that hadn&#8217;t yet started using radio. But now it was twelve hundred years later. Who knew how advanced the Tau Cetians might be?


Rated PG.  Contains minor profanity, and very tame references to populating new worlds.  Hey, someone&#8217;s got to.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Which one are you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The kid fans out a small stack of super hero trading cards, but it&amp;#8217;s not a Union deck. Figures. &amp;#8220;Lemme see what you got there.&amp;#8221; I flip through and remember my old baseball card collection. I knew there was something special about me, when at nine-years-old, I accurately calculated the probable batting stats of each player, on every team, in the 1996 season after opening only one pack. The Union recruited me five years later after my dad beat a couple of Atlantic City casinos for ten million bucks. I was caught on security camera tape telling him when and how to bet at the roulette wheel.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;These don&amp;#8217;t look like you.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;The card displays a blue-costumed man leaping between buildings. I hand it back to him. &amp;#8220;Those guys aren&amp;#8217;t real, but I am.&amp;#8221; Wow. Did I just say that? Maybe I&amp;#8217;ll tell the kid that Santa and the Easter Bunny aren&amp;#8217;t real either. He&amp;#8217;s staring at me now, I can almost see his little brain struggling to make sense of my answer. I should tell him to buy Union Cards but, you know, he&amp;#8217;s five.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains profanity, some violence involving children, and retail corporate exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As promised in the past couple of episodes, our online storefront for selling podcast archive CDs is (finally!) up and running at &lt;a href="http://poddisc.com"&gt;PodDisc.com&lt;/a&gt;.  This is your chance to get all of your holiday shopping done in one place &amp;#8212; provided everyone you know wants over 45 hours of science fiction short stories on CD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do the discs look like?  I&amp;#8217;m glad you asked.  They look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='/media/EP_Collection3.jpg' alt='Escape Pod Collection 3' width='350' height='350' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful, isn&amp;#8217;t it?  And for a very slight fee, you can have your own personal message put on the CD.  You can buy each disc for $10 or a bundle of all three collections for $25.  Shipping is a cheap flat rate in the U.S. (and tolerable everywhere else), and satisfaction is guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now only Escape Pod CDs are available, but once the business model proves viable I plan to open this up to producing archive discs for other podcasters.  If that&amp;#8217;s a service you&amp;#8217;d be interested in, &lt;a href="mailto:eley@escapeartists.info"&gt;drop me a line&lt;/a&gt; and I&amp;#8217;ll give you more details.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;And remember:&lt;/i&gt; If you&amp;#8217;ve donated $20 or more to Escape Pod this year, or if you&amp;#8217;re a subscriber, don&amp;#8217;t buy yet!  I&amp;#8217;ll be sending details to you in e-mail on how you can get this stuff for free.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;Right after I get some sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>2005 Hugo Winner!

By Mike Resnick.
Read by Stephen Eley.

That night I was faced with a major decision. I didn&amp;#8217;t want
to read a book called Travels With My Cats by a woman called
Miss, but I&amp;#8217;d spent my last nickel on it &amp;#8212; well, the last until

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;That night I was faced with a major decision. I didn&amp;#8217;t want
to read a book called &lt;/i&gt;Travels With My Cats&lt;i&gt; by a woman called
Miss, but I&amp;#8217;d spent my last nickel on it &amp;#8212; well, the last until
my allowance came due again next week &amp;#8212; and I&amp;#8217;d read all my other
books so often you could almost see the eyetracks all over them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;So I picked it up without much enthusiasm, and read the first
page, and then the next &amp;#8212; and suddenly I was transported to Kenya
Colony and Siam and the Amazon. Miss Priscilla Wallace had a
way of describing things that made me wish I was there, and when I
finished a section I felt like I&amp;#8217;d &lt;/i&gt;been&lt;i&gt; there.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  This product may be too disillusioning for young children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The world we now occupy is red, fourth from its sun, and extreme in its temperature. The atmosphere is lethal. Without  our shelters we would die. But we will not be here long.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Marcus didn&amp;#8217;t say anything. He stood behind someone he thought he once knew and tried to figure what to say next. Not a man normally tied for words, Marcus found himself in the very surreal position of being speechless.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mike offered Nick some pot.  &amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s really something,&amp;#8221; he said.  &amp;#8220;To have gone to the end of the world.  Hey, Ruby, maybe we&amp;#8217;ll talk to the travel agent about it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nick took a deep drag and passed the joint to Jane.  He felt pleased with himself about the way he had told the story.  They had all been very impressed.  That swollen red sun, that scuttling crab.  The trip had cost more than a month in Japan, but it had been a good investment.  He and Jane were the first in the neighborhood who had gone.  That was important.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains drugs, swinging, and frequent gratuitous apocalypses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I launched into my next bit, which I&amp;#8217;d rehearsed that morning on the tram. &amp;#8220;What I liked about your stories is that you never knew where they were going. It&amp;#8217;d start off as a World War II military adventure, but then it would wind up being about android worms from another dimension out to steal Earth&amp;#8217;s dirt. It&amp;#8217;s like other writers&amp;#8217; stories are bridges: There&amp;#8217;s a beginning, there&amp;#8217;s an end, and it&amp;#8217;s a pretty straight shot through. It might be a long bridge, or curvy, maybe, so you can&amp;#8217;t quite see the ending coming. But the trip basically makes sense. Your stories were different, though. You always blew up your bridges halfway across, and you&amp;#8217;d have to swim for the banks, and you&amp;#8217;d end up on some rock with weird lizards.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the verge of laughter, he looked at me. &amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;re kidding, right?&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I announced this in the intro to &lt;a href="http://www.escapepod.org/2006/12/28/ep086-when-we-went-to-see-the-end-of-the-world/"&gt;last week&amp;#8217;s episode&lt;/a&gt;, but got distracted and didn&amp;#8217;t put it into written form here.  Until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the aid of an anonymous donor, Escape Pod is presenting a contest for &lt;b&gt;the best SF story of 300 words or less&lt;/b&gt;.  There are no restrictions on theme, plot, or structure.  The goal is simply to present a strong idea-based story in the minimum space possible.
&lt;a id="more-185"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enter, simply send your name, address, and the title and story to &lt;a href="mailto:contest@escapepod.org"&gt;contest@escapepod.org&lt;/a&gt;.  Please look at our &lt;a href="http://www.escapepod.org/guidelines"&gt;submission guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for formatting instructions.  This is effectively an Escape Pod story submission; only the selection process is different.  Please send a &lt;i&gt;maximum&lt;/i&gt; of three stories to us.  If you happen to have a trunk full of really short pieces, select your three best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you&amp;#8217;ve sent your story, I&amp;#8217;ll strip your name from it and post it to a members-only area on the &lt;a href="http://forum.escapeartists.info"&gt;Escape Pod forum&lt;/a&gt;.  Because it won&amp;#8217;t be publicly viewable or searchable, it shouldn&amp;#8217;t count as &amp;#8216;published&amp;#8217; by anyone&amp;#8217;s guidelines, and you&amp;#8217;ll retain all rights to the story.  Interested forum members will be able to review the stories and comment on them.  On February 1, I&amp;#8217;ll create a poll (or a series of polls, if there are too many entries) and invite people to select their favorites.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highest-rated story will receive an Escape Pod contract to run their story as flash fiction at a rate of $100.  That&amp;#8217;s five times our standard flash rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-highest rated story will receive a contract at a rate of $50.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third-highest rated story will receive a standard flash contract, and so will any others that I, as EP&amp;#8217;s editor, think are excellent choices for Escape Pod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stories will then be produced in audio and will go out on Escape Pod&amp;#8217;s feed, and be made available for any other non-commercial use as specified in our &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/"&gt;Creative Commons  license&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The deadline is January 31, 2007.&lt;/b&gt;  Anything we receive after that will be forwarded back to our usual submissions process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound like fun?  Any questions?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to it, and we look forward to seeing your (very short) work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A slender girl on a pink dragon passed us going the opposite way, her blond hair billowing. Matt waved to her. He said over his shoulder, &#8220;I met that girl last night. Hold on, I want to say hi.&#8221; He yanked the reins and we banked sharply. My stomach lurched. We swept around in an arc and came up alongside the girl. Her dragon had the guileless beady eyes and scrunched up cheeks of a lap dog. Matt said, &#8220;Hi. Dora, right?&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#8220;Deirdre,&#8221; she corrected. &#8220;And you&#8217;re &amp;#8230; Matt?&#8221; He grinned, and she said, &#8220;I like your dragon.&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains sexual themes, third-world exploitation, and awkward freshmen.&lt;/p&gt;

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://ultradark.livejournal.com/"&gt;By James Trimarco.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Read by Frank Key (of &lt;a href="http://www.hootingyard.org/"&gt;Hooting Yard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://podcasts.resonancefm.com/archives/category/shows/hooting/"&gt;Hooting Yard on the Air&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
First appeared in &lt;a href="http://www.afterburnsf.com/articles.php?action=nerveGas"&gt;Afterburn SF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;After the first week of practice, I knew how to anticipate Mickey&amp;#8217;s
every move. I knew how to sense weariness in the jogging of his spine
and would inject increased levels of oxygen into his airflow when I
did. I knew that his heartbeat grew irregular when the platoon crossed
a rope bridge high over the practice-room floor, and for that exercise
I would work a calming agent into his stream. I liked to chant
patriotic slogans in his ear as we practiced. &amp;#8220;Oh the children of
empire are marching,&amp;#8221; I sang, &amp;#8220;to crush the rebel threat.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Although my programmers intended these songs to stimulate high levels
of patriotism, Mickey didn&amp;#8217;t like them. Perhaps that&amp;#8217;s when the first
droplets of doubt moistened the soil where the pendulous flowers of my
confusion would one day bud. . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sorry, your honor, if my poetry offends you. That&amp;#8217;s when I first
questioned his loyalty, I should have said.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains battle scenes, Imperial propaganda, overenthusiastic chemistry, and bad poetry.&lt;/p&gt;

I&#8217;m sorry, your honor, if my poetry offends you. That&#8217;s when I first
questioned his loyalty, I should have said.

Rated PG.  Contains battle scenes, Imperial propaganda, overenthusiastic chemistry, and bad poetry.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Now, this Land was the home of exceptionally brave warriors 
and beautiful damsels (and occasionally they were the same person, 
since beautiful damsels were pretty assertive back then). Each 
young boy and girl was taught all the arts of warfare, and were 
soon adept with sword, mace, lance, bow and arrow, dagger, and the 
off-putting snide remark. They were schooled in horsemanship, 
camouflage, and military strategy. They learned eye-gouging, ear-biting, kidney-punching, and &amp;#8212; since they were destined to become 
knights and ladies &amp;#8212; gentility.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;So successful was their training that before long enemy 
armies were afraid to attack them. Within the borders of the Land 
justice was so swift that there was not a single criminal left. It 
would have been a very peaceful and idyllic kingdom indeed &amp;#8212; 
except for the dragons. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated G&lt;/b&gt;.  It&amp;#8217;s a children&amp;#8217;s story.  Not recommended for cynical audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

Read by The Word Whore (of &lt;a href="http://www.theitspot.com/"&gt;Air Out My Shorts&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
First appeared in &lt;a href="http://www.fsfmag.com"&gt;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp;amp; Science Fiction&lt;/a&gt;, July 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;What do you see?&amp;#8221; he asks.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I want to say &lt;/i&gt;a menace&lt;i&gt;, but instead I tap the delivery barrel and give the context-appropriate answer.  &amp;#8220;Unused ad space.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Suddenly he&amp;#8217;s a schoolmaster who has finally found a bright pupil in a classroom full of dunces.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Exactly, Ms. Monroe.  &lt;/i&gt;Exactly&lt;i&gt;.  No square millimeter wasted, that&amp;#8217;s what I say.&amp;#8221;  He leans across the table and whispers conspiratorially, &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re looking at co-branding an AOL-Time-Warner-Starbucks Lattepaloosa Crave with a Forever Fitness session discount.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains sexual innuendo, advertising warfare, and better living through chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

"What do you see?" he asks.

I want to say a menace, but instead I tap the delivery barrel and give the context-appropriate answer.  "Unused ad space."

Suddenly he's a schoolmaster who has finally found a bright pupil in a classroom full of dunces.

"Exactly, Ms. Monroe.  Exactly.  No square millimeter wasted, that's what I say."  He leans across the table and whispers conspiratorially, "We're looking at co-branding an AOL-Time-Warner-Starbucks Lattepaloosa Crave with a Forever Fitness session discount."


Rated R.  Contains sexual innuendo, advertising warfare, and better living through chemistry.

First appeared in &lt;a href="http://www.sfsite.com/fsf/"&gt;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp;amp; Science Fiction&lt;/a&gt;, August 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Frankly, we were excited. This move was what our Pack needed &amp;#8212; the four of us, at least, were sure of it. We were all tired of living in the ghetto &amp;#8212; we were in three twentieth-century townhouses in Billings, in an &amp;#8220;age-mixed&amp;#8221; area full of marauding Thirteens and Fourteens and Fifteens. Talk about a people damned by CDAS &amp;#8212; when the virus hit them, it had stuck their pituitaries and thyroids like throttles jammed open. It wasn&amp;#8217;t just the giantism and health problems caused by a thirty-year overdose on growth hormones, testosterone, estrogen, and androgen. They suffered more from their social problems &amp;#8212; criminality, violence, orgies, jealousy &amp;#8212; and their endless self-pity.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Okay, Max liked them. And most of the rest of us had been at least entertained by living in the ghetto. At birthday parties, we could always shock the other Packs with our address. But that was when all eight of us were there, before Katrina and Ogbu went south. With eight of us, we&amp;#8217;d felt like a full Pack &amp;#8212; invincible, strong enough to laugh at anyone.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains graphic sexual content and children who are a bit too grown up.  Literally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Of the six suns, only Beta is left in the sky. Do you see it?&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The  question was rather unnecessary.  Beta  was  almost at zenith, its
ruddy light  flooding the landscape to an unusual  orange  as  the brilliant
rays of setting Gamma died. Beta was at aphelion. It was small; smaller than
Theremon had ever seen it before, and for the moment it was undisputed ruler
of Lagash&amp;#8217;s sky.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lagash&amp;#8217;s own  sun, Alpha, the  one about which  it revolved, was at the
antipodes, as were  the two distant companion pairs. The red dwarf Beta &amp;#8212; Alpha&amp;#8217;s immediate companion &amp;#8212; was alone, grimly alone.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aton&amp;#8217;s upturned face flushed redly in the sunlight. &amp;#8220;In just under four
hours,&amp;#8221; he said, &amp;#8220;civilization, as we know it, comes to an end. It will do
so because, as you see, Beta is the only sun in the sky.&amp;#8221;  He smiled grimly.
&amp;#8220;Print that! There&amp;#8217;ll be no one to read it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

First appeared in &lt;a href="http://www.asimovs.com/"&gt;Asimov&amp;#8217;s Science Fiction&lt;/a&gt;, December 1997.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A man, a woman, and a child emerge from the Temple of the 
Honored Sun. The woman holds a camera to her eye, capturing the 
same image from a dozen unimaginative angles. The child, his lip 
sparsely covered with hair that is supposed to imply maturity, 
never sees beyond the game he is playing on his pocket computer. 
The man looks around to make sure no one is watching him, grinds 
out a smokeless cigar beneath his heel, and then increases his 
pace until he joins them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;They approach me, and I will myself to become one with my 
surroundings, to insinuate myself into the marble walls and stone 
walkways before they can speak to me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am invisible. You cannot see me. You will pass me by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Hey, fella &amp;#8212; we&amp;#8217;re looking for a guide,&amp;#8221; says the man. &amp;#8220;You

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;One must show the proper respect for knowledge, and learn by watching and
counting and copying.  The Doctor does almost nothing but learn &amp;#8211;
although he watches the wrong things &amp;#8212; and some of us think he might be
a little sacred as well, which is one of the reasons he is still alive. 
It might be unlucky to eat a sacred person.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;But the main reason he is still among us is someday we will learn
something valuable from him, and then maybe the village will support the
lives of a few more of the People.  We watch him carefully.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The simulations, while good, are not impenetrable even to their own inhabitants. Scientists teaching baboons to sort blocks may notice that all other baboons become instantly better at block-sorting, revealing a high-level caching mechanism. Or engineers building their own virtual worlds may find they cannot use certain tricks of optimization and compression&#8212;for Matthias has already used them. Only when the jig is up does Matthias reveal himself, asking each simulated soul: what now? Most accept Matthias&amp;#8217;s offer to graduate beyond the confines of their simulation, and join the general society of Matthias&amp;#8217;s house.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You may regard them as bright parakeets, living in wicker cages with open doors. The cages are hung from the ceiling of the priest&amp;#8217;s clay hut. The parakeets flutter about the ceiling, visit each other, steal bread from the table, and comment on Matthias&amp;#8217;s doings.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains some profanity and child abuse.  It&amp;#8217;s probably too complex for young children as well.&lt;/p&gt;

First appeared in Asimov&amp;#8217;s Science Fiction, June 2006.

Eighteen months later, the fledging Web network declared bankruptcy, and a small consortium acquired its assets, including Invasion of a Small World. Eager to recoup their investment, the new owners offered all eight episodes as a quick-and-dirty DVD package. [...]</description>

When sales proved somewhat better than predicted, a new version was cobbled together, helped along by a genuine ad budget. The strongest initial sales came from the tiny pool of determined fans&#8212;young and well educated, with little preference for nationality or gender.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The alien and the boy, who was twelve, sat in the windowless room high above the city that afternoon. The boy talked and the alien listened.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The boy was ordinary&#8212;the genes of three continents in his features, his clothes cut in the style of all boys in the vast housing project called LAX. The alien was something else, awful to behold; and though the boy knew it was rude, he did not look up as he talked.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He wanted the alien to kill a man, he said. It was that simple.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The moment the words left his mouth, Wendel&amp;#8217;s heart stopped and his eyes went wide.  If he&amp;#8217;d known a spell that could grab those words and stuff them back down his throat, he would have cast it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instead, those words scampered all the way across his bedroom, as words are inclined to do, and rushed into the ears of the dragon in the window.  Wendel watched in horror as the words sunk into Squonk&amp;#8217;s brain.  Squonk&amp;#8217;s eyes grew wide, his mouth dropped open, and before Wendel could think of anything to say&amp;#8211;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;You can &lt;strong&gt;learn&lt;/strong&gt; to be a wizard?!  That&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;awesome!&lt;/strong&gt;  I wanna be a wizard!  Lemme be your &amp;#8216;prentice!&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"What's a 'prentice?"

Without thinking, Wendel answered.  "An apprentice is young person who wants to be a wizard, so they find an older wizard to teach them."

The moment the words left his mouth, Wendel's heart stopped and his eyes went wide.  If he'd known a spell that could grab those words and stuff them back down his throat, he would have cast it.

Instead, those words scampered all the way across his bedroom, as words are inclined to do, and rushed into the ears of the dragon in the window.  Wendel watched in horror as the words sunk into Squonk's brain.  Squonk's eyes grew wide, his mouth dropped open, and before Wendel could think of anything to say--

"You can learn to be a wizard?!  That's awesome!  I wanna be a wizard!  Lemme be your 'prentice!"

Rated G.  It's a children's story about a dragon raised by a bluebird.  Set content expectations accordingly.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The reflection of what appears to be a girl of eleven looks back at me from the full-length mirror in the bedroom that was my mother&amp;#8217;s. Together we spit out yet another baby tooth, which reminds me I need to drink another calcium-enriched protein shake. Either that, or eat what remains of my mother.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;She&amp;#8217;s the pile of coarse dust scattered across the bedsheets. Some of my kind swear by mother dust, the way certain factions among the rest of the population swear by breast feeding. And there are benefits, whether you&amp;#8217;re still a kid with growing bones or an adult woman facing osteoporosis by the end of the week.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;But my mother is not strawberry-flavored, so I opt for the shake.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hell, even if you&amp;#8217;ve made peace with a human body, like Les suggested, you still want to spread, don&amp;#8217;t you? Big-time colonizers, you tiny beasties.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oh, I know. It&amp;#8217;s just natural selection. Those bugs that accidentally find a good vector spread. Those that don&amp;#8217;t, don&amp;#8217;t. But it&amp;#8217;s so eerie. Sometimes it sure &lt;b&gt;feels&lt;/b&gt; purposeful&amp;#8230;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I am a lonely mammalian organism who has committed acts of heroism on behalf of your species and wishes only the reward of a more intimate relationship ["love"] with Miss Lisabeth Calkins.  I beseech compassionate members of H. sapiens to speak favorably of me to her.  I am loyal, trustworthy, reliable, devoted, and extremely intelligent.  I would endeavor to give her stimulating companionship and emotional fulfillment ["happiness"] in all respects within my power.

Permit me to explain the pertinent circumstances.

Closing music: &amp;#8220;The Fall,&amp;#8221; by &lt;a href="http://www.whiskeyandapples.com/artists.htm"&gt;Red Hunter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I was a child when the sky changed. I can still remember days when it was endlessly blue, the clouds passive and gentle. The change occurred without warning: one morning we awoke and the sky was a pale, blushing rose. We began to see intention in the slow, ceaseless movements of the clouds. Instead of floating, they swam spirals in the sky. They gathered in knots, trailing wisps like feet and tails. We felt them watching us.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We adapted. We had never taken more than we needed from the land, and we always kept our animals far from water. Now we moistened wild cotton and stretched this across our smoke holes as filters. Sometimes the clouds would gather over fires that were out in the open. A tendril would stretch down, weaving like a snake&amp;#8217;s head, opening delicate mist jaws to nip the plume of smoke. Even the bravest warriors would quickly put such fires out.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains passing nudity and apocalyptic themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mia didn&amp;#8217;t reply.  Her attention was riveted to Esefeb.  The girl flung herself up the stairs and sat up in bed, facing the wall.  What Mia had see before could hardly be called a smile compared to the light, the sheer joy, that illuminated Esefeb&amp;#8217;s face now.  Esefeb shuddered in ecstasy, crooning to the empty wall.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Ej-es.  Ej-es.  Aaahhhh, Ej-es!&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mia turned away.  She was a medician, but Esefeb&amp;#8217;s emotion seemed too private to witness.  It was the ecstasy of orgasm, or religious transfiguration, or madness.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Mia,&amp;#8221; her wrister said, &amp;#8220;I need an image of that girl&amp;#8217;s brain.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;You can get a pretty good look at the swath, here.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;On a day without monsters, it would have been a nice view.  You could
see most of the town center, and all the way to Pacific Coast Highway
the misty ocean beyond.  A wide, flat, smoking scar of ruin cut from
the water to a shopping center half a mile inland.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains profanity and giant monster violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seated on a bollard, the man contemplatively removed his pipe, as if to tamp
it down or relight it. Instead, he placed it stem down in the top pocket of
his shirt, then reached up and pressed his fingers against his cheekbone and
forehead. His face came away from his hairline, round behind his ears, down
to a point just above his Adam&#8217;s apple. The inside of his mouth and much of
his sinus were also part of the prosthesis, so only bare eyeballs in the
upper jut of his skull remained &#8211; the rest being the black spikes and plates
of bio-interfaces.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cheel gaped. From another pocket, the man took some sort of tool and began
to probe inside the back of his detached face. He put the prosthesis in his
lap, then took up his pipe and placed it in his throat sphincter. Smoke bled
from between the interface plates of his cheeks. His bare eyeballs swivelled
towards Cheel then back down to the adjustments he was making. She suddenly
realised who this must be. Here was the veteran who worked on the ferry.
Here was one of the few survivors from a brutal war between factions of
dense-tech humans. Not understanding what was impelling her, she walked out
on the jetty and approached him. 
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains slight profanity and high-tech violence.&lt;/p&gt;

Yoshi, at the Department of Human Heritage. Antonio explained his
situation in the Tyrranean language.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Not long after that, Antonio had an appointment with his curator,
Yoshi, at the Department of Human Heritage. Antonio explained his
situation in the Tyrranean language.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;So you&amp;#8217;re unsatisfied with your role as a beggar,&amp;#8221; Yoshi said.
&amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s hardly surprising. The unemployed of the early twenty-first
century were also unhappy. Your emotions are true to period, that&amp;#8217;s
all.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;But it&amp;#8217;s all wrong,&amp;#8221; Antonio insisted. &amp;#8220;I did well in school. I
studied to be an engineer. If this was the real Italy, someone like me
wouldn&amp;#8217;t end up like this.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yoshi&amp;#8217;s mouth curved into the sterile non-smile of a bureaucrat with
no time for sympathy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains strong themes of violence and terrorism, strong language, and some sexual content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My mother left us on a slate-gray evening when I was five, with her namesake falling from the sky and piled high around the windows and doors.  Awakened by raised voices, I watched through a tear in the curtain that shielded my sleeping mat as my mother wrapped her limbs in a shining, white kimono.  As far back as I could remember, she had always worn the dark wool shifts that all mountain people wear, spun from the hair of the half-mad goats that give us milk and cheese.  In her kimono she looked like a princess, or a queen.  Her skin was paler than mine, and I am thought quite fair.  Roku, the boy who lived on the northern crest, used to tease me when we were little, calling me &amp;#8220;ghost girl&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;milk face.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

First appeared in &lt;a href="http://www.hub-mag.co.uk/"&gt;Hub Magazine&lt;/a&gt; Issue #2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unable to keep my distance, I walk up to three classmates interacting with one such a BIKO. The pictures are fuzzy, the colours ill-defined and the reaction time tediously slow. However, the letters appearing are large and easily readable, and after all three kids have been asked to introduce themselves the program equally divides its attention to each of them, making them take turns while the other two can effortlessly follow what&amp;#8217;s going on. But man, is it slow. The display makes your eyes water and would have any western whizz kid tuning the screen properties like crazy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Still, the real wonder is that those pell-mell constructions are doing anything at all. Furthermore, those African kids have nothing to compare them with, so are uncritically happy with what they&amp;#8217;ve got. As dinner time closes in Liona has to wrestle most kids away from their new toys and promises that first thing tomorrow they will &amp;#8212; after school hours &amp;#8212; start making new BIKOs, so that eventually every classmate will have one. The whole class cheers and Liona&amp;#8217;s smile doesn&amp;#8217;t leave her face for the rest of the evening.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains sexual innuendo, some strong language, and an R-rated bit of podcast feedback at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;You are mistaken, sir,&amp;#8221; Papa said.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I was nineteen years old. I had followed Bohr&amp;#8217;s career for half my life, with something bordering on worship. A terrible miracle of circumstance had finally brought me into his presence. But at that moment his life meant nothing next to my own. Niels Bohr was already a prisoner of the Third Reich&#8218;&#196;&#238;nothing could stop that now. Papa&amp;#8217;s action could only put us on a boxcar to Theresienstadt.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains scenes of graphic violence.&lt;/p&gt;

Bohr sighed, looked up at the Gestapo captain with calm resignation, and took his wife's hand. He started to get up.

"You are mistaken, sir," Papa said.

I was nineteen years old. I had followed Bohr's career for half my life, with something bordering on worship. A terrible miracle of circumstance had finally brought me into his presence. But at that moment his life meant nothing next to my own. Niels Bohr was already a prisoner of the Third Reichsbquo;Auml;icirc;nothing could stop that now. Papa's action could only put us on a boxcar to Theresienstadt.

Rated PG.  Contains scenes of graphic violence.

She should have called her folks last night.  They paged her three separate times after the test.  But she wanted to wait until she had results, until she had something new to say instead of going over the same old arguments.  She's twenty-five, old enough to make her own choices.  Old enough to make her own mistakes.

Her parents thought the testing was mistake number one.  It certainly was expensive enough, but the doctor said he advised it for any couple about to get married. If they're genetically incompatible, he'd said, they have the choice of terminating the relationship, planning for an expensive future, or tying tubes sbquo;Auml;icirc; practicing irreversible infertility, as one of her friends called it.

Options.  That's what her parents don't get.  It's all about options.

And results.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Let it go Kindred. We&amp;#8217;ve been through a lot.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Well that&amp;#8217;s good. So now you&amp;#8217;re free to put on a carnival. Get everyone together and onto the jet now. And I mean &lt;b&gt;now!&lt;/b&gt;&amp;#8221; Her voice is so loud it draws everyone&amp;#8217;s attention away from the show.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Tina tugs on Kindred's bullet-tattered red cape. "What kinda tricks do you do?"

Kindred shakes her head as if bewildered by the question. "Tricks?" She glances back at Megaton, who now juggles three Jersey barriers about a hundred meters out in the devastation.

"Let it go Kindred. We've been through a lot."

"Well that's good. So now you're free to put on a carnival. Get everyone together and onto the jet now. And I mean now!" Her voice is so loud it draws everyone's attention away from the show.

Megaton drops the Jersey barriers and the ground shakes.

Kindred lowers herself to one knee beside the little girl. "My trick is special," she says, "I can make the whole circus disappear. Abracadabrasbquo;Auml;icirc;"

Rated PG.  Contains superhero violence and organizational politics.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alex stumbled from the confessional, through the church, all the way to the curb.  He had to get out of there.  He couldn&amp;#8217;t sit in the house of God anymore.  God didn&amp;#8217;t want him there.  That was abundantly clear.  Forty-one years of perfect mass attendance.  Six years as an altar boy.  A childhood spent praying for his grandmother&amp;#8217;s soul to hasten her time in Purgatory.  A spotless record of weekly confessions for the past twelve years.  He&amp;#8217;d even stopped having sex with Alison two years ago after she&amp;#8217;d gotten a tubal ligation so he wouldn&amp;#8217;t be committing fornication.  He&amp;#8217;d followed the rules when he could, and asked for forgiveness when he couldn&amp;#8217;t.  But none of it mattered.  He would die unshriven.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unless he didn&amp;#8217;t die.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  It&amp;#8217;s our Halloween episode.  Expect to be disturbed.&lt;/p&gt;

First appeared in &lt;i&gt;Unfamiliar Territory&lt;/i&gt;, 1973.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I got home from the office as usual at 6:47 this evening and discovered that our peaceful street has been in some sort of crazy uproar all day.  The newsboy it seems came by today and delivered the New York Times for Wednesday December 1 to every house on Redbud Crescent. Since today is Monday November 22 it follows therefore that Wednesday December 1 is the middle of next week. I said to my wife are you sure that this really happened? Because I looked at the newspaper myself before I went off to work this morning and it seemed quite all right to me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;At breakfast time the newspaper could be printed in Albanian and it would seem quite all right to you my wife replied. Here look at this. And she took the newspaper from the hall closet and handed it all folded up to me. It looked just like any other edition of the New York Times but I saw what I had failed to notice at breakfast time, that it said Wednesday December 1.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Is today the 22nd of November I asked? Monday?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It certainly is my wife told me. Yesterday was Sunday and tomorrow is going to be Tuesday and we haven&amp;#8217;t even come to Thanksgiving yet. Bill what are we going to do about this?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated G&lt;/b&gt;.  It&amp;#8217;s slightly safer to listen to than the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

First appeared in &lt;i&gt;Future Wars&lt;/i&gt;, ed. Martin H. Greenberg and Larry Segriff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re all committing a crime,&amp;#8221; Audra said, leaning back and closing her eyes.  &amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s part of what we&amp;#8217;re paying you for.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Technically, she was right.  Extreme Safaris took their clients to unsanctioned or dangerous worlds, trips which could result in serious fines or, in Bryer&amp;#8217;s case, the loss of his ship&amp;#8217;s clearance for those areas.  So far, Bryer had managed to avoid the fines simply by having his clients sign a document that said they had insisted on a trip to the unsanctioned area.  He had never had his clearance removed, but he figured it wouldn&amp;#8217;t be a serious problem.  He could always charter another ship.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;You shot a sentient being,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;You didn&amp;#8217;t pay for that right.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Oh?&amp;#8221; She tilted her head toward him.  &amp;#8220;Is there a higher fee for that?&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains violence, mayhem, and politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;You know, I pitched you guys in 1999. On Sand Hill Road. One of the founding partners. Kleiner, I think. The guy ate a salad all through my slide-deck. When I was done, he wiped his mouth, looked over my shoulder, and told me he didn&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;d scale. That was it. He didn&amp;#8217;t even pick up my business card. When I looked back as I was going out the door, I saw his sweep it into the trash with the wrapper from his sandwich.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The VC &amp;#8212; young, with the waxy, sweaty look of someone who ate a lot of GM yogurt to try to patch his biochemistry &amp;#8212; shook his head. &amp;#8220;That wasn&amp;#8217;t us. We&amp;#8217;re a franchise &amp;#8212; based here in LA. I just opened up the Inglewood branch. But I can see how that would have soured you on us. Did you ever get your VC?&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If you can make it, we look forward to seeing you there!&lt;/p&gt;

find out who I was before I got Erased &amp;#8212; but along with what they
did to my brain, they gave me a new face and wiped my fingerprints
clean. I&amp;#8217;m a brand new man: two years, eleven months, and
seventeen days old. I am (fanfare and trumpets, please!)
&lt;strong&gt;William Jordan&lt;/strong&gt;. Not a real catchy name, I&amp;#8217;ll admit, but it&amp;#8217;s
the only one I&amp;#8217;ve got these days.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I had another name once. They told me not to worry about it,
that all my memories had been expunged and that I couldn&amp;#8217;t dredge
up a single fact no matter how hard I tried, not even if I took a
little Sodium-P from a hypnotist, and after a few weeks I had to
agree with them&amp;#8211;which didn&amp;#8217;t mean that I stopped trying.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Erasures &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; stop trying.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The first time I met Stu, I was just a kid and there weren&amp;#8217;t any lights hovering over his house.  The last time I saw him, when I was grown and we both knew what life could be if you let it, there were.  That&amp;#8217;s the best way to start, I guess.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;That first time, our dad piled us into our old Chevy wagon&amp;#8211;the kind you took to drive-in movies with sheets on the seats and your kids in pajamas&amp;#8211;and drove us to the north county, saying only, &amp;#8220;Stu is an inventor.  He&amp;#8217;ll never see any royalties from his inventions because the Navy owns them, but he&amp;#8217;s an inventor, the kind that made America great.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How had he first met Stu?  How does anyone in the Navy get to know a wide-eyed, crazy-haired inventor who wasn&amp;#8217;t at all &amp;#8220;strack,&amp;#8221; who shouldn&amp;#8217;t have been anywhere near the military but somehow was?  On a Secret Project, of course.  My brother and I&#8218;&#196;&#238;who were 10 and 6 at the time&amp;#8211;were sure of it.  Our dad and Stu had to be working on a Secret Project together.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated G&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains military bureaucracy, but nothing more disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;

First appeared in &lt;a href="http://www.asimovs.com/"&gt;Asimov&amp;#8217;s Science Fiction&lt;/a&gt;, March 2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Survivors isn&amp;#8217;t exactly the word. What they found were sixteen bodies without arms, legs, and most organs. What remained were essentially heads hooked up to life support and fueled by oxygenated glucose pumps.  There were a couple hundred strands of glass fibre running from the ship&amp;#8217;s walls into each skull, into each brain, into each soul. Four of the sixteen were still functioning&amp;#8211;alive is not a word to describe their condition.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;There was no hesitation on the part of Command.  They ordered everyone, except combat types like us, from the most likely targets.  Humanity couldn&amp;#8217;t allow any more people to become components for the Shardie offense.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;But civilians never listen.  Farmers were the worse, hanging onto their little plots and crops until somebody dragged them away, kicking and screaming at the injustice of it all.  That&amp;#8217;s why we were here.  Forty settlers had stupidly refused to be evacuated from New Mars. Forty we didn&amp;#8217;t know about until we got that one brief burst.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My mission was to make certain that they didn&amp;#8217;t become forty armless, legless, gutless, screamless weapon components.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains strong violence and heavy moral themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Toby took a deep breath and let it out. &amp;#8220;Oh, no. I&amp;#8217;m saying Charlotte flat out hates Christmas.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Gloria blinked. "Why do the people in Cleveland love Christmas more than anywhere else?"

"And you're saying Charlotte doesn't like Christmas?"

Toby took a deep breath and let it out. "Oh, no. I'm saying Charlotte flat out hates Christmas."

Closing Music: &amp;#8220;Chiron Beta Prime&amp;#8221; by &lt;a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com"&gt;Jonathan Coulton&lt;/a&gt;.
First appeared in &lt;a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/2003/20031222/december.shtml"&gt;Strange Horizons&lt;/a&gt;, December 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;They come to a cloud of silver mist, and there Santa finds a little boy made of molten silver with liquid silver eyes and sweeping silver delta wings. His wrists are ringed with missile launchers, and a rounded cone emerges from a cavity in his chest. Once there were many silver boys, fleets of them, protecting the outermost parts of inhabited space against things that came from outside inhabited space. But now, there is only the silver boy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;You, sir,&amp;#8221; the silver boy says, &amp;#8220;are a tiresome consciousness cluster. Your binary value system remains as laughable as it is irrelevant. How you manage to remain cohesive is beyond me.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;My value system is hardly binary,&amp;#8221; Santa says. &amp;#8220;In between naughty and nice I&amp;#8217;ve made room for you: grumpy but fundamentally sound. Do you want a toy or not?&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains some dark Santa-related imagery, and the heat death of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;All right, so I&amp;#8217;m chasing these things down the
street, and there&amp;#8217;s more showing up all the time, so
now there&amp;#8217;s like ten of them. I have no idea how I&amp;#8217;m
supposed to wrangle all these space monkeys, and right
about then is when this dude comes swooping down out
of the sky, wearing this blue costume with a big
yellow star on his chest.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Another hero,&amp;#8221; Jill says.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Guy named Astro,&amp;#8221; I say. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;d run into him a
few times before, back when GoDS 1.0 was still
together. He would be fighting this monster - that was
his thing, fighting these random space monsters - and
we&amp;#8217;d show up to help out. I thought he was okay, but
the other guys didn&amp;#8217;t like him much.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Why not?&amp;#8221; Jill asks.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Well, he was kind of a dork. No offense,&amp;#8221; I
say, turning to Dave. Dave waves it off.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains some profanity, some scatology, and a lot of silly superhero violence.&lt;/p&gt;

"Guy named Astro," I say. "I'd run into him a
few times before, back when GoDS 1.0 was still
together. He would be fighting this monster - that was
his thing, fighting these random space monsters - and
we'd show up to help out. I thought he was okay, but
the other guys didn't like him much."

"Why not?" Jill asks.

"Well, he was kind of a dork. No offense," I
say, turning to Dave. Dave waves it off.

Rated PG.  Contains some profanity, some scatology, and a lot of silly superhero violence.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I look at the calendar
hanging on the wall above my bed.  I reach up, lift it
off its nail with one hand and snuggle back under the
covers, taking the calendar with me and running a
finger over all the red Xs marked over all the days
leading up to this one.  It&amp;#8217;s a little cold out, and
the last thing in the universe I want to do is catch
an effing cold the week of my birthday, so I snuggle
down into the warmth of my flannel sheets even more.
I know there&amp;#8217;s going to be parties this weekend, and
I&amp;#8217;m going to want to go.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is what I&amp;#8217;ve been waiting for all these months.
All these years, I guess, though before my friends
started getting theirs, it didn&amp;#8217;t seem like such a big
deal.  We were all No-Knows then.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tomorrow, I&amp;#8217;m finally going to feel like I belong.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gruen was on the sixty-first master, and while his wisdom had
grown steadily, he had worn very little.  He was incredibly
well-preserved&amp;#8211;the palms of his three-fingered hands still sported the
deep, swirling ridges that had worn to nothing in most people before
they&amp;#8217;d lived thirty years.  Indeed, all of the myriad folds and ridges
in his thick maroon skin were for the most part intact.  His eyes were
still housed in tight sockets, surrounded by thickly-ridged cheeks.
Besides the feet, the eyes were the greatest point of weakness for those
who aspired to read the works of the masters.  Ceaseless up-and-down eye
movement caused the sockets to wear out, and eventually the reader&amp;#8217;s
eyes fell out.  At that point they were forced to trace the carved words
with their fingers.  Friction quickly took its toll on the hands;
readers rarely made it through one master&amp;#8217;s teachings this way before
their hands were ground to the wrist, and they were finished.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Read by Jared Axelrod (of &lt;a href="http://planetx.libsyn.com/"&gt;The Voice of Free Planet X&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
First appeared in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0972054774/escapepod-20"&gt;All-Star Zeppelin Adventure Stories&lt;/a&gt; (ed. David Moles &amp;amp; Jay Lake).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We are somewhere among the tallest mountains of the world. When we arrived, I was locked away in a cargo hold, so I don&#8217;t know exactly where. Our home is a small, drafty castle and a separate laboratory. Dr. Octavio had the locals construct the lab before he tested the new death ray on their village. There&amp;#8217;s very little left there. In my little bit of spare time, I try to bury the bodies and collect anything useful to the doctor&#8217;s experiment.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My primary duties consist of keeping the castle&amp;#8217;s furnace running and clearing the never-ending snow from the path between the two buildings. Sometimes, it falls too fast for my slow treads and shovel attachment to keep up with and I find myself half-buried in the snow. It is horrible on my gears when this happens, but I use heavyweight oil now and it helps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is one of the few benefits of my metal frame that I appreciate. Life in this contraption is like being wrapped in swaddling clothes. I wonder if I would feel anything if my casing caught on fire? I need to ask the doctor when he isn&#8217;t in one of his moods.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Parental guidance suggested for violence and ennui.&lt;/p&gt;

Our home is a small, drafty castle and a separate laboratory. Dr. Octavio had the locals construct the lab before he tested the new death ray on their village. There's very little left there. In my little bit of spare time, I try to bury the bodies and collect anything useful to the doctorrsquo;s experiment.

My primary duties consist of keeping the castle's furnace running and clearing the never-ending snow from the path between the two buildings. Sometimes, it falls too fast for my slow treads and shovel attachment to keep up with and I find myself half-buried in the snow. It is horrible on my gears when this happens, but I use heavyweight oil now and it helps.

It is one of the few benefits of my metal frame that I appreciate. Life in this contraption is like being wrapped in swaddling clothes. I wonder if I would feel anything if my casing caught on fire? I need to ask the doctor when he isnrsquo;t in one of his moods.

Rated PG.  Parental guidance suggested for violence and ennui.

Closing music: &amp;#8220;I Crush Everything&amp;#8221; by &lt;a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com"&gt;Jonathan Coulton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I spent the longest five weeks of my life in that tank and in a deeper pool, healing, testing, practicing.  My feet and toes had been augmented much like my hands, my thighs shortened to maximize the available muscle.  I was damned quick.  Relearning construction techniques with my new fingers was sometimes frustrating, yet my progress was real and those periods of solitary labor became important to me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;At the surface, in the shallows, doctors poked and prodded and put me through redundant tortures.  I had been warned that the study of my new body would be extensive and did my best not to fear or hate them, but I&amp;#8217;d never imagined such intense scrutiny.  During my years as a SEAL, I had been like a bug under a microscope, constantly evaluated and scored.  Here I was the microscope, my body the only lens through which they could measure their work.  Stenstrom tried to be my buddy, as he had always tried, joking and asking what I&amp;#8217;d do with the money, yet his possessiveness was obvious.  &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;ll be famous,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;ll change the world.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I wasn&amp;#8217;t a slave or a pet, exactly, but I was anxious to get started.  To get away from them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains moderate violence.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s not like they&amp;#8217;re gonna get killed or lynched or nothing. But it&amp;#8217;s tough just the same.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know any Blacks. You got to go to Laramie, or Cheyenne to see them. But I watch Cosby when it&amp;#8217;s on. The Confederacy ain&amp;#8217;t as bad as the folks in Columbia might think. Sure everyone&amp;#8217;s segregated, but it&amp;#8217;s all equal and the Platte County school district is pretty good about African-American History Month.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If I just lay here they will get tired and leave. They can&amp;#8217;t hurt me all that much; my body is too hard now, too strong. But I can&amp;#8217;t let on that their kicks and punches don&amp;#8217;t bother me or who knows what they&amp;#8217;ll do next. So I&amp;#8217;ll lay here, curled up in the grass like some lump of igneous rock cast from a far away volcano.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;You fat assed son of a bitch! Talk to Loreen again and I&amp;#8217;ll kill you! You understand me? I&amp;#8217;ll beat your fat lazy ass to death!&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I bet his foot is starting to ache. My stomach is big, but it&amp;#8217;s not soft. Not anymore. Not since last month when the change happened. We don&amp;#8217;t have a lot of money so my wardrobe is still designed for a three hundred pound teenager, the kind with an almost unnatural love for pizza and potato chips. I still sort of look the same. But I &lt;b&gt;am&lt;/b&gt; different, I can &lt;b&gt;feel&lt;/b&gt; it. The rolls of flab that once encircled my belly and back are nearly gone, replaced by rippling muscle. My arms and legs are like tree trunks. I could rip Scott&amp;#8217;s arms and legs off and beat his torso like a kettledrum.  Well, if I wasn&amp;#8217;t terrified.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains profanity and violence.&lt;/p&gt;

		<ns2:summary>By Jeffrey R. DeRego.
Read by Stephen Eley.

If I just lay here they will get tired and leave. They can't hurt me all that much; my body is too hard now, too strong. But I can't let on that their kicks and punches don't bother me or who knows what they'll do next. So I'll lay here, curled up in the grass like some lump of igneous rock cast from a far away volcano.

"You fat assed son of a bitch! Talk to Loreen again and I'll kill you! You understand me? I'll beat your fat lazy ass to death!"

I bet his foot is starting to ache. My stomach is big, but it's not soft. Not anymore. Not since last month when the change happened. We don't have a lot of money so my wardrobe is still designed for a three hundred pound teenager, the kind with an almost unnatural love for pizza and potato chips. I still sort of look the same. But I am different, I can feel it. The rolls of flab that once encircled my belly and back are nearly gone, replaced by rippling muscle. My arms and legs are like tree trunks. I could rip Scott's arms and legs off and beat his torso like a kettledrum.  Well, if I wasn't terrified.

Rated R.  Contains profanity and violence.

I think she was the perfect wife. When I think about
how hard it is to measure up to her, my stomach feels
twitchy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Closing Music: &amp;#8220;Juzt Mizunderztood&amp;#8221; by &lt;a href="http://www.normansherman.com/"&gt;Norm Sherman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My head throbs. I think about the mess in the fridge, the heaps of crap in the flat while I force the clumps of wet clothes into the dryers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;As far as I know I am the only Union member who works outside the system, the only one tasked specifically with fighting crime, secretly, of course. Darksider put the program together with one of the Luminaries as a way to explore expanding our role in the maintenance of Normal society. He chose me specifically because I am the only super-agile who is also an orphan. Therefore, I won&amp;#8217;t be tempted to throw my costume in a dumpster and make a break for mom and dad.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Communication with the Union ended seven months ago. Darksider was supposed to make sure that a stipend was deposited into a bank account under my phony name every month. But that stopped too. I don&amp;#8217;t know why. I tried everything to make contact short of walking up to the Boston Pyramid and knocking. Not that it would have done any good since none of the regular Union knows I even exist. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains sordid occupations, drug use, and violence.  Welcome to the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;They would have called her salvage, if there were anyone left to salvage her. But she was the last of the war machines, a three-legged oblate teardrop as big as a main battle tank, two big grabs and one fine manipulator folded like a spider&amp;#8217;s palps beneath the turreted head that finished her pointed end, her polyceramic armor spiderwebbed like shatterproof glass. Unhelmed by her remote masters, she limped along the beach, dragging one fused limb. She was nearly derelict.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beach was where she met Belvedere.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains implied violence and themes of death.&lt;/p&gt;

They would have called her salvage, if there were anyone left to salvage her. But she was the last of the war machines, a three-legged oblate teardrop as big as a main battle tank, two big grabs and one fine manipulator folded like a spider's palps beneath the turreted head that finished her pointed end, her polyceramic armor spiderwebbed like shatterproof glass. Unhelmed by her remote masters, she limped along the beach, dragging one fused limb. She was nearly derelict.

The beach was where she met Belvedere.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;That Winter, Will le Fey held down a job working for a haint politician named Salem Toussaint. Chiefly, his function was to run errands while looking conspicuously solid. He fetched tax forms for the alderman&#8217;s constituents, delivered stacks of documents to trollish functionaries, fixed L&amp;amp;I violations, presented boxes of candied John-the-Conqueror root to retiring secretaries, absent-mindedly dropped slim envelopes containing twenty-dollar bills on desks. When somebody important died, he brought a white goat to the back door of the Fane of Darkness to be sacrificed to the Nameless One. When somebody else&#8217;s son was drafted or went to prison, he hammered a nail in the nkisi nkonde that Toussaint kept in the office to ensure his safe return.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He canvassed voters in haint neighborhoods like Ginny Gall, Beluthahatchie, and Diddy-Wah-Diddy, where the bars were smoky, the music was good, and it was dangerous to smile at the whores. He negotiated the labyrinthine bureaucracies of City Hall. Not everything he did was strictly legal, but none of it was actually criminal. Salem Toussaint didn&#8217;t trust him enough for that. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains dark, seedy places and dark, seedy characters, only a few of them alive.&lt;/p&gt;

First appeared in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060846755?ie=UTF8&amp;#038;tag=escapepod-20&amp;#038;creativeASIN=0060846755"&gt;The New Space Opera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, ed. Gardner Dozois &amp;amp; Jonathan Strahan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When you&amp;#8217;re as old as I am, you&amp;#8217;ll find your memory&amp;#8217;s not what it was. It&amp;#8217;s not that you lose memories. That hasn&amp;#8217;t happened to me or anyone else since the Paleocosmic Era, the Old Space Age, when people lived in caves on the Moon. My trouble is that I&amp;#8217;ve gained memories, and I don&amp;#8217;t know which of them are real. I was very casual about memory storage back then, I seem to recall. This could happen to you too, if you&amp;#8217;re not careful. So be warned. Do as I say, not as I did.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Some of the tales about me contradict each other, or couldn&amp;#8217;t possibly have happened, because that&amp;#8217;s how I told them in the first place.

		<ns2:summary>2008 Hugo Nominee!

By Ken MacLeod.
Read by Stephen Eley.
First appeared in The New Space Opera, ed. Gardner Dozois #38; Jonathan Strahan.

When you're as old as I am, you'll find your memory's not what it was. It's not that you lose memories. That hasn't happened to me or anyone else since the Paleocosmic Era, the Old Space Age, when people lived in caves on the Moon. My trouble is that I've gained memories, and I don't know which of them are real. I was very casual about memory storage back then, I seem to recall. This could happen to you too, if you're not careful. So be warned. Do as I say, not as I did.

Some of the tales about me contradict each other, or couldn't possibly have happened, because that's how I told them in the first place. Others I blame on the writers and tellers. They make things up. I've never done that. If I've told stories that couldn't be true, it's because that's how I remember them.

Here's one.

Rated R.  Contains profanity, nudity, and in flagrante delicto.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Why?&amp;#8221; I had trouble believing Jenny really wanted to leave. Maybe this was all some sort of joke.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Just promise,&amp;#8221; Jenny said.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;No.&amp;#8221; Even if she was serious, Jenny was the last person I wanted following me into space.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Read by Anna Eley.
First appeared in Bruce Coville's Book of Aliens II, ed. Bruce Coville.

Jenny was silent for a while. "Promise me something?" she finally asked. "If they ever come for you, promise you'll let me know?"

"Why?" I had trouble believing Jenny really wanted to leave. Maybe this was all some sort of joke.

"Just promise," Jenny said.

"No." Even if she was serious, Jenny was the last person I wanted following me into space.

Jenny took a deep breath. "I'll tell you, too. If they ever come for me."

Rated G.  This is a young adult SF story.

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I smiled, admiring her strength and her energy. Monty scowled. &amp;#8220;Take that puppy-dog-in-love look off your face. It&amp;#8217;s embarrassing. And you,&amp;#8221; he said, addressing Morgan, &amp;#8220;should know better than to get your hopes up. After all, as the saying goes, they only ever bring back Shakespeare.&amp;#8221;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First, there&#8217;s the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A special kind of pressure, high under Tara&#8217;s chin, that makes her feel heavy and light all at once. She kneels by the chair and leans across the edge, because if she faints, the chair will roll away and she won&#8217;t choke. She&#8217;s always careful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the pressure she gets dizzy, and her vision gets kind of&#8230; narrow, dark around the edges. It&#8217;s hard to breathe, and it feels like there&#8217;s something stuck in her throat. Prickles run up and down her back, down her arms where the pain used to be, and a warm fluid kind of feeling sloshes around inside her. She slides down, as things get dark, and then she starts to dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not like night time dreams. These are special.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rated R.&lt;/strong&gt; Contains children engaging in extremely dangerous practices. Parental guidance STRONGLY recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Special closing music:&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8220;Showdown in Shinjuku&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Incognito&amp;#8221; by &lt;a href="http://daikaiju.org"&gt;Daikaiju&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They try everything. Cellular toxins. DNA replication inhibitors. Anti-sense nucleic acids. Artillery. Great bolts of lightning. Nothing stops him, it only makes the monster angrier. They try mutagens, teratogens, carcinogens, neurotoxins, hemotoxins, genotoxins &#8212; they think that toxins in the environment created the monster, and maybe toxins can kill it. Maybe two wrongs can make a right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They don&amp;#8217;t, apparently. I worry about the residues left in the ground after the monster&amp;#8217;s moved on. He&amp;#8217;s going up and down the eastern seaboard. Janie talks about flying out there to help, but she doesn&amp;#8217;t want to get stomped on. Who would? A team of guys from work drive across the country to do whatever they can. They figure that patent annuities can still get paid in their absence. I want to go, but I have to stay to help my mom. That&amp;#8217;s my fight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains violence on a grand scale and illness on a human scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Senator Wu accepted Twing&amp;#8217;s seed out of courtesy, although she had no
intention of conceiving his child. Twing of Sails had thrown this
party in his house in her honour, but he wasn&amp;#8217;t as free with
kilojoules as he was with genetic material, and Senator Wu wasn&amp;#8217;t
prepared to funnel the heat donations of her two cr&#232;che mates to bring
another man&amp;#8217;s child to the World. She acidified the pores in her
tentacle and waved it around, letting the current carry away the dead
spores. She smiled at Twing and a wave of blue burst from his centre
and radiated towards the thin membranes that rippled on the edge of
his disc-shaped body.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He didn&amp;#8217;t look bad, but he wasn&amp;#8217;t as comely as Senator Wu. Her body
was an almost perfect sphere, and she was well aware of it. Wherever
she went, she took care to rotate every few minutes, lest gravity pull
on her too long in any one direction and tug her gelatinous figure out
of shape.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains alien reproduction, politics, and other sordid topics.&lt;/p&gt;

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sorry folks.  I know that EP is getting to the point where it&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; late these days, but today it&amp;#8217;s going to be a bit later than usual.  There are a few good reasons for it &amp;#8212; some related to the content itself, and some related to things going on with me &amp;#8212; but it would be inappropriate for me to go into all of it right this moment.  We&amp;#8217;re &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; skipping a week, and I&amp;#8217;m fairly certain EP170 will be posted by noon today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, by way of apology and spurred by some demand for it in the forums, here&amp;#8217;s a minor bonus for those interested: the raw, mostly unedited recording session from Dr. Bowie&amp;#8217;s and my reading of &amp;#8220;How I Mounted Goldie, Saved My Partner Lori, and Sniffed Out the People&amp;#8217;s Justice&amp;#8221; last week.  If you enjoy knowing how the sausage gets made, this particular file is a slightly more entertaining example than most.  This isn&amp;#8217;t going into the feed, because it isn&amp;#8217;t really an Escape Pod episode; you&amp;#8217;ll have to either listen in the browser, or right-click on it and download it yourself if you want to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When the bus reaches the corner, they climb onboard, taking seats on
their side and evening out the ride so it doesn&amp;#8217;t feel so much like
we&amp;#8217;ll tip over.  We rattle along past road construction, the men
working behind screens that are consecrated by the priests each
morning as part of the men&amp;#8217;s quarter, and resanctified to the women at
quitting time.  The sun already pelts down mercilessly and they will
have to leave off working soon.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We enter the government quarter and arrive at the Children&amp;#8217;s Center, a
long concrete brick of a building with windows shielded from the sun
by an open grid of deep squares made of the same material.  The
morning light turns it into a chessboard of glaring white and dark
shadow.  I don&amp;#8217;t work with the children, who are on the lower floors
and the sheltered playground of the courtyard, but toil away with
records on the upper floors.  Unlike Jamin or Zel, I am permitted by
the job to work alongside women, but only because I completed my
theological studies and am a candidate for the priesthood.  My
superiors do not know of the taint on my soul.  Do not know yet, I
should say, and when they discover it I will never be ordained or
promoted.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

it was still funny on &lt;strong&gt;You Bet Your Life&lt;/strong&gt; twenty-five years later.  He

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;First: my apologies for recent delays in getting Escape Pod out; in the last couple of weeks it&amp;#8217;s hit the feed Friday afternoons rather than late Thursday.  It&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; going to happen again this week.  Personal business lately has included me losing my day job, finding a new and much better day job in the space of a couple of weeks (I start Tuesday), and taking on some short-term obligations to fill in the gaps.  Expect more on that in an upcoming metacast In the meantime I&amp;#8217;m realizing I&amp;#8217;m having to get &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better organized with a lot of Escape Artists work, not for efficiency but for necessity.  So yes, things are late; but I still don&amp;#8217;t expect to miss any weeks, and I hope that the lateness will be short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to the news: once again, Escape Pod and Minx&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://polyweekly.com"&gt;Polyamory Weekly&lt;/a&gt; will be hosting a joint meetup at Dragon*Con.  Just like last year, we&amp;#8217;ll be doing a group brunch on &lt;b&gt;SUNDAY, AUGUST 31 AT 11:30 AM&lt;/b&gt;, at the &lt;a href="http://gordonbiersch.com/restaurants/index.php?pg=location&amp;#038;sub=loc&amp;#038;location_id=28"&gt;Gordon Biersch Brewpub&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;#8217;s about a mile north from the hotels, but an easy walk or cab ride.  This time we have the restaurant&amp;#8217;s upper mezzanine reserved, so it&amp;#8217;s like having the place to ourselves.  Ask at the front for the Escape Pod meetup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, I expect to hit very little programming at this year&amp;#8217;s D*C.  My intent for almost the entire con is just to hang out at the bars or parties, and socialize and relax.  If you&amp;#8217;d like to join me, follow my &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/SFEley"&gt;Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt; to find out where I am or &lt;a href="mailto:sfeley@gmail.com"&gt;drop me a line&lt;/a&gt; to met me know where you are.  And if you know where the &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; parties are &amp;#8212; let me know too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, and we&amp;#8217;ll have the next EP up as soon as possible.  (It&amp;#8217;s a Union Dues story, if that helps with the waiting.)&lt;/p&gt;

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been in e-mail contact today with Jeffrey DeRego&amp;#8217;s wife Cindy.  She tells me that he had open heart surgery yesterday to bypass five blocked arteries.  The surgery was successful and he&amp;#8217;s expected to go home sometime next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone cares to know for purposes of sending cards or flowers, etc., he&amp;#8217;s at the Catholic Medical Center in Manchester, New Hampshire.  You&amp;#8217;re also welcome to send cards via us (&lt;b&gt;Jeffrey DeRego, c/o Escape Artists Inc., PO Box 1538, Stone Mountain GA  30086&lt;/b&gt;) and I&amp;#8217;ll see that they get forwarded to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked if any financial assistance would be useful, and without getting into overly personal details, the answer is &amp;#8220;yes.&amp;#8221;  The DeRegos aren&amp;#8217;t in a good position right now in terms of employment, and while they&amp;#8217;re applying for state assistance, surgery of this magnitude is still certain to have a very harsh impact.  Escape Artists will be making a contribution, and with Cindy&amp;#8217;s permission, I&amp;#8217;m asking the Escape Pod listenership to help out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve set up a PayPal address just for this purpose under our corporate account.  If you&amp;#8217;d like to help Jeff out, please send your contributions via PayPal to &lt;b&gt;derego@escapepod.org&lt;/b&gt;.  (I hope to have a better link on the sidebar by tonight.)  We&amp;#8217;ll cover PayPal fees, so 100% of funds donated will go to defray Jeff&amp;#8217;s and Cindy&amp;#8217;s medical expenses.  I&amp;#8217;ll keep that PayPal address open through September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please follow your conscience on whether to help.  Jeff&amp;#8217;s given us some of our favorite EP stories, and I&amp;#8217;m happy to do whatever I can for him.  If you see fit to help him out too, I&amp;#8217;m sure he and his wife would be very grateful.  Thanks for your attention.&lt;/p&gt;

Every now and then we strike it rich. Usually we make a profit. Once in a while we just break even. There&amp;#8217;s only been one world where we actually lost money; I still remember it &amp;#8212; Greenwillow.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Every now and then we strike it rich. Usually we make a profit. Once in a while we just break even. There&amp;#8217;s only been one world where we actually lost money; I still remember it &amp;#8212; Greenwillow. Except that it wasn&amp;#8217;t green, and there wasn&amp;#8217;t a willow on the whole damned planet.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;There was a robot, though. We found him, me and the Baroni, in a barn, half-hidden under a pile of ancient computer parts and self-feeders for mutated cattle. We were picking through the stuff, wondering if there was any market for it, tossing most of it aside, when the sun peeked in through the doorway and glinted off a prismatic eye.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Hey, take a look at what we&amp;#8217;ve got here,&amp;#8221; I said. &amp;#8220;Give me a hand digging it out.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains profanity and some sadness.&lt;/p&gt;

Every now and then we strike it rich. Usually we make a profit. Once in a while we just break even. There's only been one world where we actually lost money; I still remember it -- Greenwillow. Except that it wasn't green, and there wasn't a willow on the whole damned planet.

There was a robot, though. We found him, me and the Baroni, in a barn, half-hidden under a pile of ancient computer parts and self-feeders for mutated cattle. We were picking through the stuff, wondering if there was any market for it, tossing most of it aside, when the sun peeked in through the doorway and glinted off a prismatic eye.

"Hey, take a look at what we've got here," I said. "Give me a hand digging it out."


Rated R.  Contains profanity and some sadness.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;She&amp;#8217;s no idiot, though.  &amp;#8220;I want the Debutante persona,&amp;#8221; she says.  &amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;re still not Debutante Molly are you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I like a girl who doesn&amp;#8217;t need me to explain everything.  &amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s right, kid,&amp;#8221;  I pull my blonde hair back into a pony tail and cover it with my fedora.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Why do you keep coming out as a Petey persona?&amp;#8221;  Poor kid sounds like she&amp;#8217;s about to cry.  Don&amp;#8217;t blame her for wanting Debutante Molly. Debbie&amp;#8217;s the kind of girl who reminds me why God bothered with Adam&amp;#8217;s rib in the first place.  As wholesome and satisfying as a virgin daiquiri on a hot day.  Everything I&amp;#8217;m not.  &amp;#8220;Petey&amp;#8217;s not even a girl&amp;#8217;s name,&amp;#8221; the kid says.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  A somewhat dark kid&amp;#8217;s story; contains parental tragedy and complex social issues.&lt;/p&gt;

That's when I see my new boss.  Four feet of trouble.  Brunette variety.  Tear tracks cutting through the dirt on her face, wearing jeans that were already old when Molly Dolls were nothing more than molded plastic and fantasy homes.

She's no idiot, though.  "I want the Debutante persona," she says.  "You're still not Debutante Molly are you?"

I like a girl who doesn't need me to explain everything.  "That's right, kid,"  I pull my blonde hair back into a pony tail and cover it with my fedora.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I just swab my arm and administer the cocktail, a booster for my
radiation immunization. The taste of brass fills my mouth in seconds,
and I know that the cocktail has flooded my system. With this stuff
burbling inside, I can stare down three sieverts without blinking, or,
more importantly, losing my immune system, teeth, hair, and intestines.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When I finish with my dose, I grab the skin on the newbie&amp;#8217;s arm, swab
her and shoot her up, too. &amp;#8220;Ow!&amp;#8221; She jumps and rubs her arm. I watch
carefully to see her smack her lips at the taste. &amp;#8220;You could&amp;#8217;ve warned
me.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;No time,&amp;#8221; I say, doctoring Ken and the others just as abruptly. We&amp;#8217;re
pressed, and they know it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We&amp;#8217;re all nice and anodized on the inside at 8:12. We&amp;#8217;re waiting for
8:16, or thereabouts. There aren&amp;#8217;t any atomic clocks in 1945, so all
times are approximate, internally speaking. And from here on in, there&amp;#8217;s
no point speaking any other way.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains mass destruction and graphic descriptions of the wounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Humans laid the foundation for the sixth apocalypse in much the same way they&amp;#8217;d triggered the previous ones. Having recovered their ambition after the Apocalypse of Serotonin and rebuilt their populations after the Apocalypse of Grease, they once again embarked on their species&amp;#8217; long term goal to wreak as much havoc as possible on the environment through carelessness and boredom. This time, the trees protested. They devoured buildings, whipped wind into hurricanes between their branches, tangled men into their roots and devoured them as mulch. In retaliation, men chopped down trees, fire-bombed jungles, and released genetically engineered insects to devour tender shoots.
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pitched battle decimated civilians on both sides, but eventually &amp;#8212; though infested and rootless &amp;#8212; the trees overwhelmed their opposition. Mankind was forced to send its battered representatives to a sacred grove in the middle of the world&#8217;s oldest forest and beg for a treaty.
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains war, invasion, exodus, mass extinction, religious revival, and a lot of mud.&lt;/p&gt;

The pitched battle decimated civilians on both sides, but eventually -- though infested and rootless -- the trees overwhelmed their opposition. Mankind was forced to send its battered representatives to a sacred grove in the middle of the worldrsquo;s oldest forest and beg for a treaty.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;All ten ranked cross-country runners this season took family trips to China after school let out last year. When they&amp;#8217;d returned and established dominance, King took the Asics guy up on his offer to join the experimental training program.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;The mayor seems to believe there&amp;#8217;s something to this,&amp;#8221; Tuesday said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He&amp;#8217;s desperate.  Clutching at straws.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;So why did you agree to meet?&amp;#8221; Tuesday asked, her Keds back on the
black and white tile floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samuel paused while the waitress plunked down two glasses, followed by
big metal milk shake tumblers.  His strawberry milkshake looked as thick
as cement.  Damn, did he love this place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Professor Berry said there was an easy way to prove him wrong: meet
with you on and off for a week.  If the city&amp;#8217;s accident rate didn&amp;#8217;t go
down when we were together, and back up when we were apart, he&amp;#8217;d return
his consulting fee to the city.&amp;#8221;  The shake made a satisfying plopping
sound as he poured it into the glass.  &amp;#8220;His ideas are wacked.  &amp;#8216;Data
mining for non-intuitive connections?&amp;#8217;  You can smell the bullshit from
three pastures away.&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains profanity.  Including in the closing song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nobody went home to their Elderfolk while we waited for Niles to come back.  That was a rule.  If Niles never came back, then we wouldn&amp;#8217;t have to.  Nobody wanted to see the meanies anyway.  They had us Made and then hated us afterwards, which wasn&amp;#8217;t fair.  All arties know you love the things you Make no matter what.  But Elderfolk were just-plains all grown up and they didn&amp;#8217;t make any sense at all.  Some of the younger arties started to talk about going back, but we older arties who knew Niles better said no, that we&amp;#8217;d wait.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Three days passed before Niles came back.  It was dark and everyone was sleeping but me, because little Boo&amp;#8217;s music itched in my brain.  He came in carrying big boxes, and I cried big tears of happy at that.  He&amp;#8217;d brought some new supplies, and we&amp;#8217;d be Making again in no time flat.  I watched him for a while, carrying in box after box, and finally I fell asleep.  It felt good knowing he was back.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains some harsh slang and violence against the system.&lt;/p&gt;

A few of her team wore blue arm bands, not regulation, but overlooked more and more these days. Blue for the Admiral, blue for veneration&#8212;blue for sucking up to the brass.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The man opened the pack all the way to reveal a small arsenal of guns, grenades, explosives, and -- oddly -- knives. Very large knives. He looked up at Stanuel. "I am the attack. I've been asked to shut Pan down."

"But you're not a programmer..."

"I can do all things through explosives, who destroy for me." The man began moving the contents of the pack inside the pockets and straps of the trenchcoat, clipped more to his belt and thigh, as well as to holsters under each arm, and then added pieces to his ankles.

He was now a walking arsenal.

But only half the pack had been emptied. The mysterious mercenary tossed it at Stanuel. "Besides, you're going to help."

Rated PG.  Contains violence and political revolution.

So that he will suddenly be lifted out of all the trouble and struggle in which his sympathies have been educated, to freedom and influence.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When Flight Control assigned us utility privileges, I don&amp;#8217;t think they
expected me to brew espresso in the centrifugal head. But the weight of the
espresso machine was well within the parameters they&amp;#8217;d set, as was my use of
a couple of ounces of fresh water and a fraction of the ship&amp;#8217;s power supply
each day, so there was nothing, really, they could say or do about it.
Privileges are privileges, and if the purpose was to give both of us
something to keep us happy, it worked for me. My morning espresso ritual
kept me sane. I looked forward to it every day.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Richard, however, wasn&amp;#8217;t quite as tolerant as Flight Control.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Folks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary first.  Escape Pod is going to miss its weekly releases for the remainder of November.  We will resume in December, probably the first week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the explanation.
&lt;span id="more-321"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose I could just say that I&amp;#8217;m writing this just prior to leaving for my grandmother&amp;#8217;s funeral.  She died a few weeks ago, and the memorial service is taking place in New Jersey this weekend.  That would be sufficient excuse to miss a week by almost anyone&amp;#8217;s reckoning.  Add in a tough new day job,  lingering physical illness, and unstable brain chemistry, and I could really play for some sympathy here.  But it isn&amp;#8217;t the complete picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that I need some time.  I need to get regrounded, for my own health and also for the good of Escape Pod.  Since May of 2005 we have not missed a week, and I&amp;#8217;ve been very proud &amp;#8212; perhaps hubristic &amp;#8212; of having one of the longest uninterrupted runs in podcasting.  We&amp;#8217;ve achieved some amazing things almost by accident: we&amp;#8217;ve become the number two SF market with about 25,000 listeners, we&amp;#8217;ve brought attention to incredible stories by previously unknown authors, and we&amp;#8217;ve grown into a real business with two additional podcasts.  From a strategic point of view we&amp;#8217;re doing all right.  We&amp;#8217;re not totally where I wanted to be by now, but fundamentally we&amp;#8217;re succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But tactically, with Escape Pod in particular, I&amp;#8217;ve been flying way too close to the ground.  It&amp;#8217;s been week-to-week and barely controlled chaos for a really long time now.  My communication&amp;#8217;s always been behind, but now it&amp;#8217;s by months.  The releases keep slipping, and sometimes I don&amp;#8217;t know on Monday what the week&amp;#8217;s story will be.  It&amp;#8217;s been costing me more sleep than usual.  These are resolvable issues; I have a nice clear to-do list of obvious things that would make my job a lot easier.  (&amp;#8221;Better delegation&amp;#8221; covers about half the list.)  But I haven&amp;#8217;t been stepping back to do any of them.  Even when I have the time, it&amp;#8217;s been hard to muster the energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of all, I&amp;#8217;m afraid of losing my perspective.  For a while now I&amp;#8217;ve been pushing myself so hard on EP that it&amp;#8217;s close to becoming more Not Fun than Fun.  I&amp;#8217;m in danger of forgetting why I&amp;#8217;m doing it.  And &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; is not something I can permit.  If I lose my own passion for the stories, I know I won&amp;#8217;t be the only one who suffers.  That&amp;#8217;s the point at which the podcast will start to suck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#8217;m doing a very, &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; difficult thing right now for the sake of long-term success: I&amp;#8217;m letting myself fail for a few weeks.  I&amp;#8217;m taking a breather, relaxing a bit, and trying to forgive myself for doing it.  I&amp;#8217;m going to do right by my grandmother, and then I&amp;#8217;m going to take a few days to just chill, and &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; I&amp;#8217;m going to see what I need to do to get organized and get on top of the game again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;#8217;s risky to pin such things to a schedule.  But I&amp;#8217;m pretty confident in the range of this hiatus: it will not be less than two weeks, and it should not be more than four.  The smart money&amp;#8217;s on three weeks, putting us back on in the first week of December.  We already have some great stuff pending.  We have the next Union Dues story, and in my opinion it&amp;#8217;s the best one yet.  We have a fantastic alien world story from this year&amp;#8217;s Cambpell Award winner, Mary Robinette Kowal.  And Mur Lafferty is preparing what may be the most kickass science fiction Christmas story ever.  I promise you we&amp;#8217;ll be back soon, because dammit, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; want to hear those things in audio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two logistical points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href="http://podcastle.org"&gt;PodCastle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pseudopod.org"&gt;Pseudopod&lt;/a&gt; aren&amp;#8217;t affected.  Rachel and Ann and Ben and Al are totally in the groove, and Escape Artists as a company is doing fine.  This announcement only affects Escape Pod.  So you&amp;#8217;ve still got a short fiction fix, and if those aren&amp;#8217;t enough, feel free to &lt;a href="http://drabblecast.org"&gt;check&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://clonepod.org"&gt;out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://dunesteef.com"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://welltoldtales.com"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I&amp;#8217;m well aware that donors have a pretty good reason to be upset.  You&amp;#8217;re giving your money on an article of faith, after all &amp;#8212; that we&amp;#8217;ll use it to keep bringing you stories &amp;#8212; and if we&amp;#8217;re not bringing them to you, even temporarily, we&amp;#8217;re not keeping that trust.  We&amp;#8217;ve recently had some &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; substantial donations, ones which I have yet to send proper thank-you messages for.  (Those are coming too.)  I&amp;#8217;m hoping most of you will be cool with my reasoning here and bear with us.  But if you&amp;#8217;ve donated in the past few months and you object to this hiatus, e-mail me from your PayPal address and let me know, and I will refund your money to you, no questions asked.  I would honestly rather keep your goodwill than your cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;So there you have it.  That&amp;#8217;s the honest explanation of what&amp;#8217;s going on, as best I can state it.  I&amp;#8217;ll be spending the next few weeks gathering my wits, my priorities, and a team, probably in that order.  And then you&amp;#8217;ll have more stories.  We&amp;#8217;ll be back soon.  In the meantime, thank you for any patience you&amp;#8217;re willing to give.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course: Have Fun.&lt;/p&gt;

Read by Rachel Swirsky (of PodCastle).

He smelled like new cars andnbsp;cologne, he moved with a measured rhythm. His mouth tasted like mintnbsp;toothpaste. She looked over his shoulder through the  white light ofnbsp;the window. She was sweating into her sheets, her breath  silent, andnbsp;her lips thin and tight.

Rated R. Contains sex and melancholia.

Special Closing Music: &amp;#8220;Chiron Beta Prime,&amp;#8221; by &lt;a href="http://jonathancoulton.com"&gt;Jonathan Coulton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Comet and Cupid were fifteen, and took after their father, both spending the most time in the workshop tinkering with Father&amp;#8217;s tools. Christmas was coming soon and they were preparing their yearly trip to the same orphanage that had cared for them. With nine children to raise on his own, Claus could no longer adopt, but he still found it very important to care for the children in any way he could. So he took a load of toys to the children every year, with his children helping him distribute.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Their siblings sat around their great sitting room, some crowding on sofas, some sitting on chair cushions or arms, and Rudolph, the baby at eleven, sat at his father&amp;#8217;s feet. He was an imposing man with a barrel chest and wild white hair and beard. When he would get excited about a project, his blue eyes would twinkle and he&amp;#8217;d look like a madman.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated G&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains Santa revisionism and aerial combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After careful examination of your manuscript no 113785, Corbamite, An Insulator Against Gravity, the editors of Review of Physics have concluded that it is not suitable for publication in this journal. This decision is final and further correspondence on this subject will serve no useful purpose.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Since the above may seem somewhat harsh, let me say what I can to mitigate it. The editors do appreciate that you are working under difficult circumstances: when the senior author of a paper is deceased, it is always hard for the junior author to complete the work in an appropriate manner. Also let us assure you that we do believe you. You have told us that with his dying breath Professor Steinhardt handed you his notebook and said, &amp;#8220;Have this published in Review of Physics.&amp;#8221; Such an action would be completely in character for Steinhardt since he was a true scientist.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;As for your claim that Professor Steinhardt made this statement as he was expiring from disintegrator rays wounds suffered during your escape from the City of Disembodied Brains on Altair IV, our believing that is a somewhat different matter but we need to go into that. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rated G.&lt;/strong&gt; Contains proven impossibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Statement from Rachel Swirsky:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Richard K. Lyon died on November 21. When I contacted him last month to ask if he still wanted this piece to run on our podcast, he said that the doctors didn&amp;#8217;t give him long, but that he hoped this would give the world &amp;#8220;one last laugh.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escape Artists dedicates this production to his memory. We wish the best to him, and to his family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I suck in my chest and tighten the buckles before getting lightheaded. I don&amp;#8217;t have to wear the costume anymore, but it seems disrespectful to leave it in the closet for this one last mission. I get the boots on and struggle with the leather straps and silver buckles until my fingers feel like they&amp;#8217;re ready to fall off. I surrender and creak back up to standing position. &amp;#8220;Ok screw the boot buckles, Jim,&amp;#8221; I whisper. &amp;#8220;This is it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I glance at the open briefcase laid across the corner of my desk but I&amp;#8217;ve got everything I need. I pick up the silver frame with the little black and white photo of me, Frida, Alex, Paul, and Steve in our original &lt;b&gt;Liberty League&lt;/b&gt; getup. Frida Freedom called me four hours ago. Her voice broke when she said the words, &amp;#8220;Alex is dead.&amp;#8221; I drop the frame into the case atop a weathered manila folder then close the whole thing up before hobbling out towards the waiting jet.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;People ask me if I ever get involved with the subjects of my
documentaries. I have a difficult time imagining that they would ask
my male colleagues the same question, but they seem to expect women to
be more emotional. In response, I tend to grit my teeth and answer
very patiently with another question. How could I do my job if I were
part of the story? Only by maintaining a sacred distance could I have
any hope of understanding someone&amp;#8217;s life. A documentarian records, but
does not participate.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated G&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains alien emotional drama.&lt;/p&gt;

Read by Alex Wilson (of &lt;a href="http://telltaleweekly.org"&gt;Telltale Weekly&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Adolf Hitler came to Paris in June 1941 feeling the weight of his years in his legs and the taste of a dying dream in his mouth.  He spent most of that first day walking up and down the Champs Elys&#233;es, working the stiffness out of his bones and muscles while he looked at the shops and the people.  Some of the dull ache was from the wooden benches on the train from Hamburg; most of it was age.  And beneath the discomfort of his body, his soul ached too.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He&amp;#8217;d never been here before, he thought as the Parisians slipped past in the noon-time sun.  He snorted at the revelation.  A fine painter you are, he told himself.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated R&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains sexual violence.  Also may be offensive to some for historical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

"This is normal," the doctor says, and, "Give yourself time, it's

some support groups."

"What about Marlene?"

"She's speaking with one of our counselors," the doctor says. "Full
transplant is usually something of a shock to the loved one, at
first."

"How long until I can see her?"

"That's up to her," the doctor says. "Can you squeeze the orange for me?"

As long as he doesn't look, it's fine.

"Becky." Typed Rachel "I had to ban him. I'm sorry. He was a bot, a spider, a program. He wasn't human." Becky's green words glowed on her screen almost immediately.

"He talked to me! Every day! What do you mean he wasn't human?"

Rachel exhaled; this was going to be tough. "Didn't you notice he kept trying to get you to buy games?"

"I like buying games! Who cares? I really liked Gabriel. You two were the only people on this forum I could talk to."

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He didn&amp;#8217;t call himself The Aerialist at first. The newspapers came up with that later. He called himself Kid Kangaroo of all things, because of the jumping from rooftop to rooftop, even though I made fun of him, called him &amp;#8220;Joey,&amp;#8221; made jokes about dingoes. Nobody knows his secret identity but me, and I only found out because I snuck into the treehouse one night to smoke a cigarette and found him changing out of his leotard and tights and domino mask. He was only fifteen. I still remember what he said: &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t tell anyone &amp;#8212; if my identity is discovered, you and mom and dad could be used against me.&amp;#8221; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Nobody knows his secret identity but me, and I only found out because I snuck into the treehouse one night to smoke a cigarette and found him changing out of his leotard and tights and domino mask. He was only fifteen. I still remember what he said: "Don't tell anyone -- if my identity is discovered, you and mom and dad could be used against me." 

Rated PG.  Contains sibling rivalry and comic book deconstruction.

Nathan's eyes stung as he remembered how Jenny used to do just that: the same jump down the stairs, the same windmilling of her arms as she landed....  The grief swept over him like a palpable wave, making him stagger backward.

"Dad?"  Christopher kicked his backpack down the hall to the door.  "You all right?"

"It's nothing," said Nathan.  He rubbed the implant-port behind his right ear.  It's nothing.  It's not real.

But it felt real.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Oh great Emperor,&amp;#8221; the gyoji said, continuing the ritual. &amp;#8220;These two
honorable warriors can not agree who will step aside, and who will
join the sacred battle to return you to us. We would gladly send all
our sons, but the Council of Infinite Japans says there may be only
twenty-one. So now they must fight to decide.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;May the best warrior join the fight,&amp;#8221; the crowd answered in unison
with the gyoji.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The gyoji stepped back.  Asashoryu stared into Takanasuro&amp;#8217;s
expressionless brown eyes. The match would begin upon a tacit
agreement between them. He kept Takanasuro&amp;#8217;s mid section in his field
of vision while focusing on keeping his own face blank. He knew the
beginner&amp;#8217;s lesson as if it were part of him; faces deceive and betray,
but all movement starts at the hips.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains death, betrayal, hauntings, and a challenging amount of Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; The lecture hall was pleasantly warm. Behind Prof. Thaddeus Fitch, busily writing on the chalkboard,
pencils scratched earnestly in spiral notebooks, fluorescent lights hummed, feet shuffled.  A Beach
Boys tune wafted in through open windows from the quad.
&amp;#8220;And so,&amp;#8221; he continued, &amp;#8220;travel backwards in time would violate causality, and hence appears to be impossible.&amp;#8221;  He turned to face the class.  &amp;#8220;The problem is most commonly illustrated with the &amp;#8216;Grandfather Paradox.&amp;#8217;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rated &lt;strong&gt;PG&lt;/strong&gt; for paradoxical violence.&lt;/p&gt;

"And so," he continued, "travel backwards in time would violate causality, and hence appears to be impossible."  He turned to face the class.  "The problem is most commonly illustrated with the 'Grandfather Paradox.'

Rated PG for paradoxical violence.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;But in the normal course of life, our need for air is far from our thoughts, and indeed many would say that satisfying that need is the least important part of going to the filling stations. For the filling stations are the primary venue for social conversation, the places from which we draw emotional sustenance as well as physical. We all keep spare sets of full lungs in our homes, but when one is alone, the act of opening one&#8217;s chest and replacing one&#8217;s lungs can seem little better than a chore. In the company of others, however, it becomes a communal activity, a shared pleasure.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG&lt;/b&gt;.  Contains entropy, eschatology, and empirical evisceration.&lt;/p&gt;

 Bars of light crossed my desk, carved from the sun by the open window. The
scent of hot asphalt rose from the path that led to the capitol buildings.

Beside me, Dr. Singh motioned for the guards to bring in Dr. Norman
Terriault. He looked pale. I motioned for him to sit.

The guards stood on either side. The officer saluted.

I closed the window. A faint buzzing hovered in the air.

"Why me?" Terriault asked.

"You must be familiar with the work of the Imitant Office," Singh consulted
his tablet, "Dr. Terriault."

"I'm just like both of you." Terriault leaned forward, the guards pulled him
back.

"Apparently," I said.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;She sets a stepladder next to it. She claps her hands and the 26 monkeys onstage run up the ladder one after the other and jump into the bathtub. The bathtub shakes as each monkey thuds in among the others. The audience can see heads, legs, tails; but eventually every monkey settles and the bathtub is still again. Zeb is always the last monkey up the ladder. As he climbs into the bathtub, he makes a humming boom deep in his chest. It fills the stage.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;And then there&amp;#8217;s a flash of light, two of the chains fall off, and the bathtub swings down to expose its interior.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Empty.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's going to be the Three of Clubs.

I know this, as certainly as I know my own name.  I'm less sure about some things than my fans would think.  But sometimes, the swirling laws governing what may happen coalesce into what will happen with astonishing clarity.  The sun will rise tomorrow, the Pirates will beat the Mets tonight, and as soon as I announce my "guess," the Three of Clubs will appear on the monitor in front of me.

"Jack of Spades," I proclaim, full of conviction.

The monitor flickers, and is suddenly filled by a pixilated version of the Three of Clubs.

Rated PG for...welll, you already know why, don't you?

&lt;p&gt;Special closing monkey music by &lt;a href="http://www.geologicrecords.net"&gt;George Hrab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sliding his hands over the clay, Sly relished the moisture oozing around his fingers. The clay matted down the hair on the back of his hands making them look almost human. He turned the potter&#8217;s wheel with his prehensile feet as he shaped the vase. Pinching the clay between his fingers he lifted the wall of the vase, spinning it higher.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Someone banged on the window of his pen. Sly jumped and then screamed as the vase collapsed under its own weight. He spun and hurled it at the picture window like feces. The clay spattered against the Plexiglas, sliding down the window.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rated PG&lt;/strong&gt;.  Contains one angry chimp with a potty mouth. Sort of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I didn&amp;#8217;t believe that old man any more than you believe me, but we&amp;#8217;d been waiting in that airport for four hours, so I humored him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;All right, I&amp;#8217;ll bite,&amp;#8221; I said. &amp;#8220;What did he use time travel for?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Wally didn&amp;#8217;t need to see the pyramids getting built, or sail with Columbus, or even watch JFK&amp;#8217;s assassination. What Wally wanted to do, more than anything, was get to work on time.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An introduction like that demands a story, so I sat down and let him tell me.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; I try to picture David&#8217;s face in my head, but I can&#8217;t.  They&#8217;ve told me this is temporary&#8212;a kind of shock that happens sometimes when you&#8217;ve seen a person die that way.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; My sister squeezes my hand in the back of the limo.  &#8220;It&#8217;s almost over,&#8221; she says.  Up the road, against the long, wrought iron railing, the protestors grow excited as our procession approaches.  They&#8217;re standing in the snow on both sides of the cemetery gates, men and women wearing hats and gloves and looks of righteous indignation, carrying signs I refuse to read.

Echoing in the ducts, his voice woke me around 2 A.M.nbsp; I hopped from  bed and headed for the attic--they always it up there.nbsp; A Vegas Elvis  stood by a rack of old clothes singing "Blue Christmas" to them.

As I edged in the door, he segued to "Jingle Bell Rock."nbsp; He waved me  down to the front of his meager audience, conferring a special favor.nbsp; I  settled cross-legged on the floor and enjoyed his tunes.

For months there has been an Elvis infestation all over town, but this  was the first Vegas Elvis we'd got.nbsp; He worked the room hard, sweat  dripping down the side of his forehead.nbsp; He was dressed in his trademark  white jumpsuit with the spangles and beads and the big white cape he  flourished dramatically.nbsp; The acoustics up here sucked, but even a big  fat Elvis could rock the house.

from sunlight, even though the sun had set some minutes before. Where the
girl had pointed was a bright star, moving east.

It had originally thought the goal was to hit the two small creatures in the distance. They appeared to be identical to the three creatures whom he had joined in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First approximation: separated by some distance, one attempts to down the group ahead of one using one of many metal-tipped sticks (called  &#8216;clubs&#8217;) to &#8216;drive&#8217; a small, hard ball. Those behind would, presumably, be attempting to hit one. So, one dodged and drove.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>Hi all,

Just a quick note that Escape Pod episode 200 will probably not be going out on our usual Thursday schedule this week.

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a quick note that Escape Pod episode 200 will &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; not be going out on our usual Thursday schedule this week.  We&amp;#8217;ve been negotiating for the rights to a Major Story by a Major Author.  We&amp;#8217;re dealing with the literary agency for the author&amp;#8217;s estate, which is always a slower process than working with living authors directly.  Everything appears to be a green light and the story production is moving ahead at speed, but we&amp;#8217;re waiting on final signatures.  It&amp;#8217;s my expectation that we&amp;#8217;ll have the episode out within a few days.  (Certainly before next week&amp;#8217;s regularly scheduled EP201!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s worth it.  When you hear the story I think you&amp;#8217;ll agree.  Thank you for your patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Steve&lt;/p&gt;

Ulbarton&#8217;s Flu, as the public knows all too well, now afflicts upwards of thirty million Americans, with the number growing daily as the highly contagious flu spreads.  Halitex &#8220;flu-proofs&#8221; the body by inserting genes tailored to confer immunity to this persistent and debilitating scourge, whose symptoms include coughing, muscle aches, and fatigue.  Because the virus remains in the body even after symptoms disappear, Ulbarton&#8217;s Flu can recur in a given patient at any time.  Halitex renders each recurrence ineffectual.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First appeared in The Magazine of Fantasy &amp;amp; Science Fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Astronauts are people who ride rockets into space.&#160; They must train for a very long time before they go.&#160; Astronauts must be brave and smart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Will you be an astronaut?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;* * *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The biggest rocket ever was the Saturn V.&#160; On the launch pad it was taller than a 30-story building.&#160; Today&amp;#8217;s rockets are smaller and lighter.&#160; Today&amp;#8217;s rockets can be launched more than once.&#160; They have wings and can come back to earth and land like airplanes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When a rocket launches, it&amp;#8217;s like an earthquake. The ground is shaking! There is flame and smoke. It&amp;#8217;s like an explosion!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antonio is strapped into his seat.&#160; He is about to ride to a space station.&#160; Because there is no air in space, Antonio must wear a space suit.&#160; In the suit, Antonio can breathe and talk over radio.&#160; He wears a helmet with a special faceplate that protects him from the sun.&#160; The fingers of his gloves have tiny claws that help him work with small objects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&amp;#8217;s all that noise? It must be a rocket! Astronauts are traveling to space!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5-4-3-2-1!&#160; Lift off! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rated PG-13&lt;/strong&gt;. Deceptively G&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

The biggest rocket ever was the Saturn V.nbsp; On the launch pad it was taller than a 30-story building.nbsp; Today's rockets are smaller and lighter.nbsp; Today's rockets can be launched more than once.nbsp; They have wings and can come back to earth and land like airplanes.

When a rocket launches, it's like an earthquake. The ground is shaking! There is flame and smoke. It's like an explosion!

Antonio is strapped into his seat.nbsp; He is about to ride to a space station.nbsp; Because there is no air in space, Antonio must wear a space suit.nbsp; In the suit, Antonio can breathe and talk over radio.nbsp; He wears a helmet with a special faceplate that protects him from the sun.nbsp; The fingers of his gloves have tiny claws that help him work with small objects.

What's all that noise? It must be a rocket! Astronauts are traveling to space!

5-4-3-2-1!nbsp; Lift off! 

Rated PG-13. Deceptively G...

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr. Wayne was taking his daily exercise, walking Arthur around the lake in Nevley Park, when the sky darkened and a light snow began to fall. A few flakes fluttered against his cheeks. He could feel the cold through his heavy topcoat. He enjoyed the park when it was deserted, but at his age he couldn&amp;#8217;t afford a chill. He thumbed the control in his pocket. Arthur turned left onto a bridge that would cut their return journey by a good half mile. Mr. Wayne followed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rated &lt;strong&gt;K9&lt;/strong&gt; for dogs at the cutting edge.&lt;/p&gt;

Mr. Wayne was taking his daily exercise, walking Arthur around the lake in Nevley Park, when the sky darkened and a light snow began to fall. A few flakes fluttered against his cheeks. He could feel the cold through his heavy topcoat. He enjoyed the park when it was deserted, but at his age he couldn't afford a chill. He thumbed the control in his pocket. Arthur turned left onto a bridge that would cut their return journey by a good half mile. Mr. Wayne followed.



Rated K9 for dogs at the cutting edge.

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of good writers now breaking into the big leagues through podcasting.  My friend &lt;a href="http://jchutchins.net"&gt;J.C. Hutchins&lt;/a&gt; is one of them.  I loved his &lt;a href="http://www.7thsonnovel.com"&gt;7th Son&lt;/a&gt; trilogy, and I jumped at the chance when he asked me to read an advance copy of his horror novel &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312383827?ie=UTF8&amp;#038;tag=escapepod-20&amp;#038;linkCode=as2&amp;#038;camp=1789&amp;#038;creative=390957&amp;#038;creativeASIN=0312383827"&gt;Personal Effects: Dark Art&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=escapepod-20&amp;#038;l=as2&amp;#038;o=1&amp;#038;a=0312383827" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt; and record a reaction for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s my initial reaction (Hutch liked it enough that he added the background music and bumper titling and such):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width="360" height="207"&gt;&lt;param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4947110&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=1&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=00adef&amp;amp;fullscreen=1" /&gt;&lt;embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4947110&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=1&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=00adef&amp;amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="360" height="207"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/4947110"&gt;J.C. Hutchins&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Personal Effects: Dark Art&amp;#8221; - Expert Testimony&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/sfeley"&gt;Stephen Eley&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com"&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#8217;s the big group &amp;#8220;vlurb&amp;#8221; project that my piece was a part of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width="360" height="207"&gt;&lt;param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5070261&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=0&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=00adef&amp;amp;fullscreen=1" /&gt;&lt;embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5070261&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=0&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=00adef&amp;amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="360" height="207"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/5070261"&gt;J.C. Hutchins&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Personal Effects: Dark Art&amp;#8221; - SuperVlurb&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/sfeley"&gt;Stephen Eley&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com"&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The folks in that vlurb are all awesome and you should check out their sites: &lt;a href="http://PJBallantine.com"&gt;Philippa Ballantine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scottsigler.com"&gt;Scott Sigler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://sethharwood.com"&gt;Seth Harwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://wordsushi.com"&gt;Mark Yoshimoto Nemcoff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://christianaellis.com"&gt;Christiana Ellis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://Matt-Wallace.com"&gt;Matt Wallace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://jamesmelzer.net"&gt;James Melzer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://maxquickseries.com"&gt;Mark Jeffrey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://murverse.com"&gt;Mur Lafferty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://crescentstation.net"&gt;Phil Rossi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://mattselznick.com"&gt;Matt Selznick&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read the book in PDF form.  And then I pre-ordered it on Amazon, because it&amp;#8217;s just that good.  (Also because the little goodies that come with the physical copy sound like fun.)  This is an unusual horror novel: it brings in a lot of conventional settings and tropes, but the characters break from formula in some surprising ways.  And it&amp;#8217;s a &lt;i&gt;smart&lt;/i&gt; horror novel.  Silliness in hats aside, I highly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

There are a number of good writers now breaking into the big leagues through podcasting.  My friend J.C. Hutchins is one of them.  I loved his 7th Son trilogy, and I jumped at the chance when he asked me to read an advance copy of his horror novel Personal Effects: Dark Art and record a reaction for him.

Here's my initial reaction (Hutch liked it enough that he added the background music and bumper titling and such):



J.C. Hutchins's "Personal Effects: Dark Art" - Expert Testimony from Stephen Eley on Vimeo.

And here's the big group "vlurb" project that my piece was a part of:



J.C. Hutchins's "Personal Effects: Dark Art" - SuperVlurb from Stephen Eley on Vimeo.

(The folks in that vlurb are all awesome and you should check out their sites: Philippa Ballantine, Scott Sigler, Seth Harwood, Mark Yoshimoto Nemcoff, Christiana Ellis, Matt Wallace, James Melzer, Mark Jeffrey, Mur Lafferty, Phil Rossi and Matt Selznick.)

 "You're a disgrace to your calling and your species." The Cardinal's words were at odds with the verging-on-seductive voice of the translator embedded in the Anturean's Chlor-tank. From beneath lowered lashes Ignatz O'Reilly, D.D. Inter-Species, watched his superior's mouth-tendrils vibrate, a gesture he knew denoted extreme lust or mounting rage.

 Lust was out of the question, he supposed.

 "Falling-down drunk at Mass. Passing out in Confession. And don't think your little black-market dealings go unnoticed." The Cardinal's posterior spines flushed blue. Ignatz averted his eyes even further, studying the faint brown lines crisscrossing each other on a slate floor the color of dried blood. The mutant squid bastard really was mad this time. 

 "If I might be permitted to explain, Your Eminence..." Ignatz's tongue tasted like last night's liquor. "I indulge for purely medicinal reasons...a slight asthmatic condition...any allegations that I would engage in illegal..."

Rated R for religious themes, carousing, and transubstantiaton of a different sort.

(He had bought the car used over a decade ago and retrofitted it for the intelligent interstates of the Piedmont metrosprawl.) Gordon abhorred palmflips, infraspecs, logomaniacs, microserfs, lapcops, and digital Kleenex, but he lived at the computerminal in his Callisto, journeying between office foci to talk with other human fossils like himself. He did not quail before occasional sitreps from his lead tire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First appeared in &lt;em&gt;Interzone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Zhi 4&amp;#8217;s scream pierces the Siberian night. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;My spiked metal boots crunch through the snow as I race towards him, with Zhi 6 running at my side.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The nanochip in my brainstem clicks on, and I reach out with my mind, but I can&amp;#8217;t sense even a trace of Zhi 4.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;A few seconds earlier his form had been outlined by the dark turquoise glow of the force field.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;We stop twenty feet short of the field&amp;#8217;s perimeter.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Beyond it, the hazy silhouette of the colossal Stalk looms, its millions of cilia undulating.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

First appeared in Interzone

Zhi 4's scream pierces the Siberian night. 



My spiked metal boots crunch through the snow as I race towards him, with Zhi 6 running at my side. The nanochip in my brainstem clicks on, and I reach out with my mind, but I can't sense even a trace of Zhi 4. A few seconds earlier his form had been outlined by the dark turquoise glow of the force field.



We stop twenty feet short of the field's perimeter. Beyond it, the hazy silhouette of the colossal Stalk looms, its millions of cilia undulating.


My bodysuit hums as it transmits data back to Xiang Xu Base, situated behind the Rusanov ice cap half a mile away.



My pulse flutters in anticipation and I take a deep breath to try to rein in my excitement. I -- like all Zhis -- have been designed with an insatiable curiosity about the Stalk's origins and vulnerabilities. Knowing I've been bred to feel this way doesn't make me feel it any less. Where did the Stalk come from? Why is it here? How can it thrive in these temperatures? I see the same questions reflected in Zhi 6's expression.

Rated PG-13 for cloning and some adult themes.

&lt;em&gt;
Kevin switched the audio over to the projector. The lecture hall was filled with outdoor noises. Wind hummed softly over the microphone, cattle lowed nearby, a truck accelerated in the distance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A roan steer staggered around a concreted yard, its mute distress accompanied by clattering hooves and the fleshy slap of its thigh striking the ground when it fell. A new sound was introduced - incongruous, but familiar to Kevin&amp;#8217;s audience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whale song.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gradually, the cow&amp;#8217;s shaking stilled, until it could stand securely. Its muscles continued to tremble, but not enough to upset its equilibrium while it listened.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Whale song.

Gradually, the cow's shaking stilled, until it could stand securely. Its muscles continued to tremble, but not enough to upset its equilibrium while it listened.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was polishing a brandy snifter when the Unmarried Mother came in. I noted the time&#8212;10:17 P. M. zone five, or eastern time, November 7th, 1970. Temporal agents always notice time and date; we must. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Unmarried Mother was a man twenty&#8211;five years old, no taller than I am, childish features and a touchy temper. I didn&#8217;t like his looks&#8212;I never had&#8212;but he was a lad I was here to recruit, he was my boy. I gave him my best barkeep&#8217;s smile. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maybe I&#8217;m too critical. He wasn&#8217;t swish; his nickname came from what he always said when some nosy type asked him his line: &#8220;I&#8217;m an unmarried mother.&#8221; If he felt less than murderous he would add: &#8220;at four cents a word. I write confession stories.&#8221; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If he felt nasty, he would wait for somebody to make something of it. He had a lethal style of infighting, like a female cop&#8212;reason I wanted him. Not the only one. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He had a load on, and his face showed that he despised people more than usual. Silently I poured a double shot of Old Underwear and left the bottle. He drank it, poured another. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It wasn&amp;#8217;t a big herd, but it was as big as his land and his labour could manage &#8211; the big biofabricator in the shed could assemble mammalian livestock faster than he could feed them up and sell them with an honest HAND-RAISED NOT VAT-GROWN label.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"What do you want with us?" he yelled up at the gently buzzing farm.

"Brains, fresh brains for baby Jesus," crooned the farm in a warm contralto, startling Joe half out of his skin. "Buy my brains!" Half a dozen disturbing cauliflower shapes poked suggestively out of the farms' back then retracted again, coyly.

"Don't want no brains around here," Joe said stubbornly, his fingers whitening on the stock of the shotgun. "Don't want your kind round here, neither. Go away."

When the brains aren&#8217;t eating, they&#8217;re pretending to give us directions in the field, telling us where to sniff out organics. They&#8217;re writing reports about

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We&#8217;re swapping off some boy in a backwater push the locals cleared out for us. We&#8217;re sitting around a low table. I pass off another card to Kep. Luce swaps out a suit. She has to sit on one leg to lean over the table. It&#8217;s hot in the low room, so humid that moths clutter aroundour feet, too heavy to fly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The boy&#8217;s making little mewling sounds again. Somebody should shut him up, but not me. This is my hand. I&#8217;m ahead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In January, there will be an annular solar eclipse, with the path of annularity moving through the Indian Ocean and into Sumatra and Borneo. Two days later, aliens will invade Earth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No spaceships will loom large in blue skies, nor hover over our cities. At night, though, when we see blinking dots of light near the horizon, as small and pale as any star, we&amp;#8217;ll think they&amp;#8217;re planes or satellites of human origin. They won&amp;#8217;t be. These are alien ships, come for conquest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That is all we can see. What we hear is just as faint and difficult to resolve: we hear rumors. Or rather, one persistent rumor: &amp;#8220;the aliens want volunteers.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Naturally, I and my junior faculty friends need to drink quantities of beer to discuss this in detail. I expound that it&amp;#8217;s a hoax.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

There are safety signs around the factory. "Scrub Up." "Know Thyself." "Don't Blink." That last is the best piece of advice, here on the eyeball floor.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I picked up a spade from the pile, and demonstrated by digging up a bluebell growing by the hedge.  From the large bells all round the stem, I knew it was a Spanish bluebell, a garden escape that if left unchecked would hybridise with the natives.  Too late now, though.  You can tell the British bluebell because the flowers are smaller, deeper blue, and they&amp;#8217;re usually
on one side of the stem, so the plant droops under their weight as if bowing down before its foreign conqueror.  There&amp;#8217;s hardly a wood left in England where you&amp;#8217;ll see only native bluebells.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Or you can use your heel on the spade.&amp;#8221;  I heaved the invader out of the earth and tossed it aside, knowing it would safely rot.  &amp;#8220;But you should never press down with the middle of your foot.  The bones in the arch are delicate, and you can injure yourself.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By then we were monitoring Wren Hepta-Yemenni. She fell into bed with Dorado ambassador 214, though I don&#8217;t know what he did to deserve it and she didn&#8217;t even seem sad when he expired. When they torched him she went over with the rest of the delegates, and they bowed or closed their eyes or pressed their tentacles to the floors of their glass cases, and afterwards they toasted him with champagne or liquid
nitrogen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before we expired Hepta, later that year, she smiled at me. &#8220;Make sure Octa&#8217;s not ugly, okay? Just in case&#8212;for 215.&#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He was in Piet&amp;#8217;s Number Seven, a bar-cum-caravanserai in an illegal orbit trailing far enough behind Vesta to be ignorable.  Piet&amp;#8217;s had been instantiated in an old volatiles bladder that had done the Jovian run a few too many times before falling into the surplus circuit.  You could store entire cities in Piet&amp;#8217;s cubage, which made for a somewhat attenuated bar experience.  Plus the place had one of those gravity cans &amp;#8212; yes, those gravity cans &amp;#8212; which meant your drink stayed stuck down long as you were near a Higgs carpet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So there I was annoying myself with three perfectly disrespectable rock jocks, each of us out to fleece the others, when this cadaver starts to stand over me.  We&amp;#8217;re all forever young or forever dead, but this armstrong looked like he&amp;#8217;d shaved about half a cent too deep across his whole body, then restored his dermis with spray-on thermal insulation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rated R for strong language, strong violence, and world-spanning tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

He was in Piet's Number Seven, a bar-cum-caravanserai in an illegal orbit trailing far enough behind Vesta to be ignorable.  Piet's had been instantiated in an old volatiles bladder that had done the Jovian run a few too many times before falling into the surplus circuit.  You could store entire cities in Piet's cubage, which made for a somewhat attenuated bar experience.

So there I was annoying myself with three perfectly disrespectable rock jocks, each of us out to fleece the others, when this cadaver starts to stand over me.  We're all forever young or forever dead, but this armstrong looked like he'd shaved about half a cent too deep across his whole body, then restored his dermis with spray-on thermal insulation.

They caught me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brewpub&amp;#8217;s about a mile north of the con, which makes for a long walk; but it&amp;#8217;s an easy taxi ride, and we&amp;#8217;re talking about bringing some people to carpool together as well.  Drop me a line at &lt;a href="mailto:sfeley@gmail.com"&gt;sfeley@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt; with your cell number or post in the &lt;a href="http://forum.escapeartists.net/index.php?topic=2755.0"&gt;forum thread&lt;/a&gt; if you need to coordinate transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look forward to seeing many of you there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And now I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m about to snap my laptop shut, run screaming out the front door, and never return.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Irsquo;m sitting in a book store next to a strip club.

Not that kind of book store. The inventory here is incredibly old and impossibly rare. And it has a secretmdash;a secret that I might have just discovered.

I am alone in the store. And then, tap-tap, suddenly Irsquo;m not.

And now Irsquo;m pretty sure Irsquo;m about to snap my laptop shut, run screaming out the front door, and never return.

Violet frowned. "You were supposed to dig up the backstory on the dress."

"Well, you can't blame me for getting a little distracted. Besides, isn't it bad luck for me to see?"

"That's only for weddings, not prom."

Rated R for language, teen-adult situations, and virtual steadies. Also, Norm's sexy talk.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When morning finally dawns, Rochester isn&#8217;t there anymore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jenny stands beside Eric, gazing south from the rising ground that yesterday was a fallow field.  Maybe the whole city hasn&#8217;t vanished.  Certainly the tall buildings are gone, Xerox Square and Lincoln Tower and the few others that just last night poked above the horizon, touched by the red fire of the setting September sun.  But, unlike Denver or Tokyo or Seattle, Rochester, New York sits &#8211; sat &#8211; on flat ground and there&#8217;s no point from which the whole city could be seen at once.  And it was such a small city.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#8220;Maybe they only took downtown,&#8221; Jenny says to Eric, &#8220;and Penfield is still there or Gates or Brighton&#8230;&#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rated R &lt;/strong&gt;for sexual situations and alien-caused genocide.&lt;/p&gt;

When morning finally dawns, Rochester isnrsquo;t there anymore.

Certainly the tall buildings are gone, Xerox Square and Lincoln Tower and the few others that just last night poked above the horizon, touched by the red fire of the setting September sun.  But, unlike Denver or Tokyo or Seattle, Rochester, New York sits ndash; sat ndash; on flat ground and therersquo;s no point from which the whole city could be seen at once.  And it was such a small city.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No one hears when I ease the heavy steel door shut behind me. All the ears in the darkened workshop, all those hundreds and hundreds of ears, but still no one hears a thing. And I stand there for a while, as unmoving as they, not exactly frightened and not exactly uncertain if I should see this through &#8212; I think I stand there in reverence. I be-lieve that&#8217;s the word that people use for what I feel in that moment, standing there alone, alone with that assembled crowd.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rated X&lt;/strong&gt; for violence and strong sexual situations.&#160; As Steve says in the intro, this one isn&amp;#8217;t for the kids.&lt;/p&gt;

No one hears when I ease the heavy steel door shut behind me. All the ears in the darkened workshop, all those hundreds and hundreds of ears, but still no one hears a thing. And I stand there for a while, as unmoving as they, not exactly frightened and not exactly uncertain if I should see this through mdash; I think I stand there in reverence. I be-lieve thatrsquo;s the word that people use for what I feel in that moment, standing there alone, alone with that assembled crowd.

Rated X for violence and strong sexual situations.nbsp; As Steve says in the intro, this one isn't for the kids.

&lt;p class="pullout"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The plan must have come to Rog fully formed that first morning, as he stepped off the elevator into the lobby of  Szilliken Sharpenwright and saw the old soldier newly stationed there in his omnichair between the potted  silk ferns and the coffee tables.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan, her arms loaded with Rog-House props and paraphernalia she hadn&#8217;t had time to ditch yet, said,  &amp;#8220;You say that an awful lot for someone who styles himself completely asexual.  Not to mention atheistic.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The plan must have come to Rog fully formed that first morning, as he stepped off the elevator into the lobby of  Szilliken Sharpenwright and saw the old soldier newly stationed there in his omnichair between the potted  silk ferns and the coffee tables.

"Oh.  My.  God.  I am in love."

Megan, her arms loaded with Rog-House props and paraphernalia she hadnrsquo;t had time to ditch yet, said,  "You say that an awful lot for someone who styles himself completely asexual.  Not to mention atheistic."

Rated R for adult situations, a smattering of violence, and overly friendly chairs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She said, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m Sarah,&amp;#8221; and he said his name, or what she assumed was his name, in return, rolling the syllables around in his mouth like so many rough pebbles. His name was too long, something like Shperidth with extra grunting noises in the middle, like a car backfiring very far away. She tried to repeat it and couldn&amp;#8217;t, while he stood on her doorstep sweating and folding his fingers around each other. She frowned at him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Practically the first thing she did when she took in the alien was to give him a new name. He looked at her outstretched hand long enough to annoy her, and then grasped it with his four opposable fingers and hung on limply until she wrenched her hand out of his moist and over-jointed grip.

She said, "I'm Sarah," and he said his name, or what she assumed was his name, in return, rolling the syllables around in his mouth like so many rough pebbles. His name was too long, something like Shperidth with extra grunting noises in the middle, like a car backfiring very far away. She tried to repeat it and couldn't, while he stood on her doorstep sweating and folding his fingers around each other. She frowned at him.

"I can't say that," she said.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They were the usual motley collection of freelance vampire hunters. Two men, wearing combinations of jungle camouflage and leather. Two women, one almost indistinguishable from the men though with a little more style in her leather armour accessories, and the other looking like she was about to assault the south face of a serious mountain. Only her mouth was visible, a small oval of flesh not covered by balaclava, mirror shades, climbing helmet and hood. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They had the usual weapons: four or five short wooden stakes in belt loops; snap-holstered handguns of various calibers, all doubtless chambered with Wood-N-Death&#174; low-velocity timber-tipped rounds; big silver-edged bowie or other hunting knife, worn on the hip or strapped to a boot; and crystal vials of&lt;br /&gt;
holy water hung like small grenades on pocket loops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protection, likewise, tick the usual boxes. Leather neck and wrist guards; leather and woven-wire reinforced chaps and shoulder pauldrons over the camo; leather gloves with metal knuckle plates; Army or climbing helmets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The trouble with knowing everything there is to know, Stephanie Dowling decided instantly, because that's how clever she was, was that when there was something unknown out there, she had nobody to consult.

And there was something unknown out there, nibbling away at the edge of the economy, and screwing with the Cottrell-Cockshot tatonnements sufficiently that there'd be problems. Shortages of essentials: power cells and answer boxes. Ridiculous surpluses of nonsense like chrome and diamonds. She could tell because the bride was coughing between her lines and the donkey she rode on suddenly looked ill. It would be just like hellip; wossname hellip; that old thing. Capitalism. Till she fixed it anyway.

Wossname?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flies buzzed around the edges of the huge stone block, gathering at the rivulets of blood that ran down to the floor. A bit of what looked like it might be intestine hung off one corner, drawing special attention. It was a testament to the force of the collision that fragments of bone and tissue were scattered all the way down the passage, some even wedged in the carvings in the stone walls. Two men surveyed the scene with dismay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;See? And this just keeps happening. It&amp;#8217;s getting so we can&amp;#8217;t get anything done around here,&amp;#8221; said the taller of the two, a grey-haired man with red eyes and a patchy beard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other man, younger but not precisely young, hauled himself up on top of the block and examined the mechanism. &amp;#8220;This bar&amp;#8217;s been sliced right through.&amp;#8221; He looked back down at his client. &amp;#8220;You say this was a poltergeist?&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Editor's note:nbsp; this is a sequel to EP007.nbsp; Listen to it here.

Flies buzzed around the edges of the huge stone block, gathering at the rivulets of blood that ran down to the floor. A bit of what looked like it might be intestine hung off one corner, drawing special attention. It was a testament to the force of the collision that fragments of bone and tissue were scattered all the way down the passage, some even wedged in the carvings in the stone walls. Two men surveyed the scene with dismay.

"See? And this just keeps happening. It's getting so we can't get anything done around here," said the taller of the two, a grey-haired man with red eyes and a patchy beard.

The other man, younger but not precisely young, hauled himself up on top of the block and examined the mechanism. "This bar's been sliced right through." He looked back down at his client. "You say this was a poltergeist?"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The diner stood off the highway outside a small town optimistically called Hope. Hope was being stuck in the middle of the Northwest and wishing you were someplace, anyplace else. And Hope was also the name on the tag pinned to the dead woman in waitress uniforms that was currently lying against the wall inside the _Barbie-Q Roadhouse_. I had to stop myself from worrying at the connection: looking for patterns when sometimes there are none at all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wasn&amp;#8217;t worried about Hope (the waitress, not the town). I didn&amp;#8217;t get called down here for a murder: shit, murder is an honest-to-God American pastime. Just look at the statistics. No, I got called in because of the Marilyn.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Marilyn was also dead. All in all, there were five dead people in the Barbie-Q: two waitresses; a balding man who &#8211; from his bag full of cheaply-printed catalogues &#8211; was some sort of a general salesman; the diner&amp;#8217;s manageress; and Marilyn. They had been shot by a machine gun, probably an Uzi. Marilyn&amp;#8217;s head left a red smear against the glass of the booth she sat in. She was there alone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What the hell was a Marilyn doing out here?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This story originally appeared in Aeon #14.

The diner stood off the highway outside a small town optimistically called Hope. Hope was being stuck in the middle of the Northwest and wishing you were someplace, anyplace else. And Hope was also the name on the tag pinned to the dead woman in waitress uniforms that was currently lying against the wall inside the _Barbie-Q Roadhouse_. I had to stop myself from worrying at the connection: looking for patterns when sometimes there are none at all.

I wasn't worried about Hope (the waitress, not the town). I didn't get called down here for a murder: shit, murder is an honest-to-God American pastime. Just look at the statistics. No, I got called in because of the Marilyn.

The Marilyn was also dead. All in all, there were five dead people in the Barbie-Q: two waitresses; a balding man who ndash; from his bag full of cheaply-printed catalogues ndash; was some sort of a general salesman; the diner's manageress; and Marilyn. They had been shot by a machine gun, probably an Uzi. Marilyn's head left a red smear against the glass of the booth she sat in. She was there alone.

What the hell was a Marilyn doing out here?

Rated R for violence and language.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You could feel their heat. Not a metaphor, I don&amp;#8217;t mean that, I mean literally the room grew warmer when they were in it. They were both so powerful. Whenever Anne and Jack (they weren&amp;#8217;t named that then, but that&amp;#8217;s who they were) strolled into the room you got contact highs from their lust. People who would never make out would find excuses to go to the bathroom together and come back with monster hickies. Everyone always wanted to sit near them because of their heat, and because they always said the thing you wish you&amp;#8217;d said but only thought to say a billion blinks later.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I first joined the Freebooter tech collective Anne and Jack were happy to have another girl in the group, but otherwise they ignored me. I could stare and stare at them all day long, hiding behind my black-rimmed glasses. But then one day Anne looked at me, and then Jack looked too, and we all just sort of fell toward each other. Like gravity. Like magic. Like there was a God. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From beneath the camouflage of kindling on her back came Grandma Thinkbox&#8217;s quiet voice. &#8220;You should have something hot to drink, child. Do not make yourself sick.&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#8220;Yes, nainai. As soon as I check on Pig.&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;After Comrade Liu had been evacuated with the last of the support troops, Xiaoying had rearranged the personality of her assistant battlefield AI into something that suited her better. If she were going to spend months carrying it around, she wasn&#8217;t going to listen to it drone on like a party chief. The way it talked now reminded her of her grandmother. The missiles had overlays for their small brains, too, and she&#8217;d decorated them with personalities as well. Boredom was a more immediate enemy than Japan.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rated PG.&lt;/b&gt; Contains violence and political complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

Sponsored by SleepPhones - Pajamas For Your Ears

From beneath the camouflage of kindling on her back came Grandma Thinkboxrsquo;s quiet voice. ldquo;You should have something hot to drink, child. Do not make yourself sick.rdquo;

ldquo;Yes, nainai. As soon as I check on Pig.rdquo;

After Comrade Liu had been evacuated with the last of the support troops, Xiaoying had rearranged the personality of her assistant battlefield AI into something that suited her better. If she were going to spend months carrying it around, she wasnrsquo;t going to listen to it drone on like a party chief. The way it talked now reminded her of her grandmother. The missiles had overlays for their small brains, too, and shersquo;d decorated them with personalities as well. Boredom was a more immediate enemy than Japan.

Rated PG. Contains violence and political complexity.</ns2:summary>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#8220;They bought a puppet to live in,&#8221; I say.  &#8220;Life-sized, nuskin, real speak &#8211; top of the line.  It&#8217;s supposed to be my Christmas present.  Bring the family back together for the holidays and live unhappily ever after.&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#8220;A puppet.&#8221; A puzzlement glyph pops up at the bottom of my screen.  &#8220;As in &lt;b&gt;one&lt;/b&gt; puppet?&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a timeshare &#8211; you know.  They live it serially.  Ten hours of him, fourteen of her.&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#8220;Not fifty-fifty?&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s giving her the difference so he can take extra time off for his bass tournament in June.&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Scrooge peered out, the heavy chain still on the door. Jenny flipped the night vision off her camera to get a clear view of him in the foyer&amp;#8217;s dim light. He was much smaller than his voice implied, a diminutive man who was probably a bear in the conference room, but a pussycat when in thin pajamas and a robe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Well, not a pussycat. Something more like a weasel.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"Who's there?" the voice asked, rough and unpleasant. Robert and Lydia glanced at each other.

"The Paranormalists, Mr. Scrooge. You called us a couple of hours ago," Robert said.

"Took you long enough," the voice said. The door clicked as Scrooge unlocked several locks, and finally it slid open a couple of centimeters. Scrooge peered out, the heavy chain still on the door. Jenny flipped the night vision off her camera to get a clear view of him in the foyer's dim light. He was much smaller than his voice implied, a diminutive man who was probably a bear in the conference room, but a pussycat when in thin pajamas and a robe.

Well, not a pussycat. Something more like a weasel.

I duck through the door behind her. The place is jammed with customers. "You have any money? I didn't think to ask Miss Jennifer for any."

TK answers, "don't worry, just tell me what you want."

"Large with extra sugar and cream."

TK grins and focuses her attention on the line of people stretching from the entrance down to the counter. They all sidestep and she walks unimpeded front of the pack. "One large black, and one large with extra sugar and cream."

The barrista, a girl of about 18, repeats the order in a flat monotone.

"And these are on the house. Everyone gets free coffee for the next two hours."

"Free for everyone," the clerk answers then puts our order together.

TK snickers and hands the coffee over.

Rated PG. Contains mature themes, violence, and some profanity.  You know.  Teenage stuff.

First appeared in &lt;a href="http://www.threeleggedfox.co.uk/QuercusHomeVisitors/WestPierGazette.html"&gt;The West Pier Gazette &amp;#038; Other Stories&lt;/a&gt;, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It was afternoon, after school has ended for the day. Sash has been working in the hydroponics gardens, helping the adults with the delicate work of picking the buds. It was flowering time, and the ganja plants were at the end of their cycle.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It was then, with her hands sticky with resin and her skin tingling pleasantly from the work and the heat, with Mama Kingston&#8217;s deep, melodious voice saying &#8216;a good harvest, child, a good harvest&#8217; with a throaty chuckle, when Sash felt about herself the presence of Jah in everything she did and was profoundly happy: it was then that Sash discovered, for the first time, the existence of the Secret.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Read by Stephen Eley.
First appeared in The West Pier Gazette  Other Stories, 2008.
 
It was afternoon, after school has ended for the day. Sash has been working in the hydroponics gardens, helping the adults with the delicate work of picking the buds. It was flowering time, and the ganja plants were at the end of their cycle.
 
It was then, with her hands sticky with resin and her skin tingling pleasantly from the work and the heat, with Mama Kingstonrsquo;s deep, melodious voice saying lsquo;a good harvest, child, a good harvestrsquo; with a throaty chuckle, when Sash felt about herself the presence of Jah in everything she did and was profoundly happy: it was then that Sash discovered, for the first time, the existence of the Secret.

Rated R. Contains some violence and a plot heavily focused on drug use. If you're good with that, there's not much else likely to be problematic for younger audiences.

First appeared in &lt;a href="http://literary.erictmarin.com/archives/Issue%2031/plan.htm"&gt;Lone Star Stories&lt;/a&gt;, February 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I am called Dog the Digger.  I am not mighty, neither am I fearsome.  Should you require bravos, there are muscle-boys aplenty among the rat-bars of any lowtown on this raddled world.  If it is a wizard you want, follow the powder-trails of crushed silicon and wolf&amp;#8217;s blood to their dark and winking lairs.  Scholars can be found in their libraries, taikonauts in their launch bunkers and ship foundries, priests amid the tallow-gleaming depths of their bone-ribbed cathedrals.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What I do is dig. For bodies, for treasure, for the rust-pocked hulks of history, for the sheer pleasure of moving what cannot be moved and finding what rots beneath. You may hire me for an afternoon or a month or the entire turning of the year.  It makes me no mind whatsoever.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;As for you, I know what you want.  You want a &lt;b&gt;story.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

My step-daughter Wynter, who is regrettably prejudiced against robots
and those who love us, comes floating through the door in a
metaphorical cloud of glitter instead of her customary figurative
cloud of gloom. She enters the kitchen, rises up on the toes of her
black spike-heeled boots, wraps her leather-braceleted arms around my
neck, and places a kiss on my cheek, leaving behind a smear of black
lipstick on my artificial skin and a whiff of white make-up in my
artificial nose. ldquo;Hi Kirby,rdquo; she says, voice all bubbles and light,
when normally she would never deign to utter my personal designation.
ldquo;Is Moms around? Havenrsquo;t talked to her in a million.rdquo;

I know right away that Wynter has been infected.

&lt;p&gt;This&amp;#8217;ll be a short message, with a longer one later.&#160; First things first: I am alive.&#160; Family&amp;#8217;s doing well, including Harper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/30334780@N00/4503923699/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4040/4503923699_7875f0827c_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;There&amp;#8217;s been a lot going on, but that&amp;#8217;s a lousy excuse to be radio silent for this long.&#160; I&amp;#8217;m sorry about that.&#160; This doesn&amp;#8217;t justify it, but it&amp;#8217;s symptomatic of one thing: I&amp;#8217;ve been managing my energy poorly.&#160; I&amp;#8217;m being stretched too thin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;That warrants more explanation, and I&amp;#8217;ll say more soon.&#160; What I want you to know right now is that I&amp;#8217;m going to be resigning from Escape Pod.&#160; This isn&amp;#8217;t actually a negative, although it probably sounds that way.&#160; It&amp;#8217;s the right thing to do for myself &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;#8217;s the right thing to do for the podcast.&#160; There&amp;#8217;s a plan in the works to bring new energy in &amp;#8212; one or more people who will do better by you than I have lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;Escape Pod won&amp;#8217;t be going away.&#160; I really do think the podcast matters.&#160; The stories matter, and the audience matters.&#160; And I&amp;#8217;m not going to say you&amp;#8217;ll never hear my voice again.&#160; But I won&amp;#8217;t be trying to keep everything on my shoulders.&#160; That worked for a few years, and I felt I needed to keep coming back to it.&#160; But I think you deserve better.&#160; And we&amp;#8217;re going to work to make sure you get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;Whew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;So.&#160; How&amp;#8217;s things with you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Escape Pod will be back up and running May 12 (which, incidentally, is our 5 year anniversary/birthday/thingie). &lt;strong&gt;Also, we will be closed to submissions until July 1.&lt;/strong&gt; If you do not hear from us by then, feel free to resubmit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll be announcing the new editor shortly, until then, thank you for your patience, your support, and your concern. &lt;/p&gt;

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cross posted from &lt;a href="http://murverse.com/2010/05/07/new-escape-pod-editor-announced/"&gt;Murverse.com&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;ve been hinting at a seekrit project for a while now, and it&#8217;s finally public: Steve Eley, the brilliant mind behind the first podcast fiction magazine, is stepping down from&#160;&lt;a href="http://escapepod.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Escape Pod&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and I&#8217;ll be taking his place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;ve been involved with Escape Artists in one way or another several times in the past five years. Steve has published several of my short stories, and asked me and Ben Phillips to helm&#160;&lt;a href="http://pseudopod.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Pseudopod&lt;/a&gt; when it launched. I had to step down in 2007 because i had a day job and simply had to let some outside things go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;ve been working behind the scenes on the EP thing for a couple of weeks now, sifting through slush with some truly dedicated volunteers. We re-launch after our hiatus next week on Escape Pod&#8217;s fifth anniversary with Steve&#8217;s last podcast. Then I will take over hosting for three weeks, then we will run our traditional Hugo short story offering. July is when I&#8217;ll settle into the job fully with hosting and editing. We&#8217;ve got some new things coming up for the podcast this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But never fear! The podcast is awesome because of Steve&#8217;s vision: fun SF, and I&#8217;ll never turn away from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;ve got a great team helping me, and I&#8217;m very excited to see where we can steer this ship. Thanks for all the congrats that came through Twitter and email so far, it really means a lot to me that people have confidence in my ability to take this amazing podcast and keep it strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As the old man came in, letting the door close gently behind him, an expression came over his face that Garth had seen many times before: a compound of misty nostalgia and appalled astonishment.  His gaze swept across the yellow and orange fiberglass chairs, their cracks and dings lovingly but visibly repaired; the plastic-topped tables with the white half-moons rubbed by millions of elbows; the light softly shining from the satiny steel of the napkin and catsup dispensers.  Finally the old man&amp;#8217;s eyes stopped dead on the smiling face of the six-foot-tall fiberglass cow that stood at the end of the counter, wearing an apron and a chef&amp;#8217;s hat.  &amp;#8220;My God,&amp;#8221; he said, &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s Moogle McDougal.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;It certainly is,&amp;#8221; said Garth.  &amp;#8220;Welcome to McDougal&amp;#8217;s.  May I take your order?&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Give me a minute,&amp;#8221; he replied as he perused the menu.  He had a comfortable old boot of a voice, rough but mellow.  &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s been&amp;#8230; jeez, thirty years? &amp;#8230;since I&amp;#8217;ve been in one of these places.  Um, I&amp;#8217;ll have a double cheeseburger, a small order of fries, and&amp;#8230;.&amp;#8221;  He grinned.  &amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;and a shake.  Chocolate.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That didn&amp;#8217;t sound right. Thargus considered his response while staring at the human. It sure was ugly. A patchwork of dirty synthetics over the majority of its body, and on top of its pudgy, pink head, strand upon strand of greasy hair. Ugh!&#160; Thargus felt sick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Thargus thought the time right. He set the lights to full strength and flailed and gnashed and roared as he'd been practising. He felt rather silly, but the performance seemed to be working. The human, one hand steadying its spin, looked on intensely. It moved the white stick up to its mouth, breathed in, and then stabbed the stick out against the sac wall.

"Don't be afraid,"nbsp; Thargus said, meaning the opposite. He'd seen the trick on old films stored in the moss-brain when humans always said one thing and meant another like "We're safer if we split up."

The human exhaled a long stream of smoke. "I'm not," it said.

That didn't sound right. Thargus considered his response while staring at the human. It sure was ugly. A patchwork of dirty synthetics over the majority of its body, and on top of its pudgy, pink head, strand upon strand of greasy hair. Ugh!nbsp; Thargus felt sick.

"Be afraid, then," he said.

"Why, are you going to eat me?"

Thargus didn't feel comfortable telling an outright lie, but that didn't mean he needed to be too honest. "I might."

Rated F: for two f-bombs and some serious munchies.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For her entire adolescent and adult life up until three weeks ago, Lynda had been the queen of junk food.  Aside from the briefest blips of non-junk spending due to occasional failed diets, she had purchased only the most fattening, high-cholesterol, chemical-soaked foods available from grocery stores, restaurants, vending machines, and mail order websites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In short, she was the perfect woman.  Though she was on a diet that day, she had eaten non-nutritious foods in great quantities all her life.  Though her last purchases had been salad greens and bottled water, her 250-pound body told the true story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I knew she was just waiting for someone like me to come along.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rated PG&lt;/strong&gt;: for innuendo-heavy snack cake desire.&lt;/p&gt;

For her entire adolescent and adult life up until three weeks ago, Lynda had been the queen of junk food.  Aside from the briefest blips of non-junk spending due to occasional failed diets, she had purchased only the most fattening, high-cholesterol, chemical-soaked foods available from grocery stores, restaurants, vending machines, and mail order websites.

In short, she was the perfect woman.  Though she was on a diet that day, she had eaten non-nutritious foods in great quantities all her life.  Though her last purchases had been salad greens and bottled water, her 250-pound body told the true story.

I knew she was just waiting for someone like me to come along.

Rated PG: for innuendo-heavy snack cake desire.

I knew you loved me, of course. It was written in your eyes when you looked at me, a physics problem with no clear answer. If an irresistible force meets an immovable object, what happens then?

They meet. Thatrsquo;s all we know. Relative to each other, they are in contact. From within the object or the force, there is no way to tell if you're in motion.

Rated PG-13: for sexual description.

Her neighbor mdash; the other one, across the hall mdash; helped her figure it out, long before the math geeks finished crunching their numbers.

"Watch," he'd said, and laid a deck of cards facedown on her coffee table. (There was coffee in the cups, with a generous dollop of Bailey's. He was a nice-enough guy that Adele felt comfortable offering this.) He shuffled it with the blurring speed of an expert, cut the deck, shuffled again, then picked up the whole deck and spread it, still facedown. "Pick a card."

Adele picked. The Joker.

"Only two of those in the deck," he said, then shuffled and spread again. "Pick another."

She did, and got the other Joker.

"Coincidence," she said. (This had been months ago, when she was still skeptical.)

Rated R: for Lucky Streaks and Getting Lucky.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the first generation of Krenn had lived long enough to reach the site, though none had expected to. The very first Krenn had conceived of this journey in the distant past, dedicating his life and his posterity to the pilgrimage with an ever recycling population of clones. Like their clone-father, each was an optimized collection of smart matter no bigger than a speck. Hundreds of generations of Krenn had lived and died during the voyage, their remains enshrined into niches in the very walls of the vessel that now lay shattered at its destination.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The survivors flooded out upon the steppes of the heel, rejoicing despite the crushing weight that gravity forced upon them. They settled in, constructing mansions of haze and shadow, and waited for enlightenment to come. The mission and purpose of the first Krenn remained with each of them. This place had been the site of the greatest triumph of the greatest archaeocaster in all of history. Before the beginning of the quest, Krenn&#8212;the original Krenn&#8212;had felt drawn to it. He had cultivated the tales, sifted myth from coincidence, mastered the lost language of the interview-eschewing, spatial curmudgeons of the ancient dark times, and recreated the route through dimensional puzzles to this theoretical location. The odds of success had been so absurd not a single entelechy of Krenn&amp;#8217;s cr&#232;che dared invest time or expense in the project.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Victor can be so annoying. He constantly whistles this tuneless song, and when I complain he apologizes and then starts humming it instead. He never stands up to that ill-mannered little hunchback that he&#8217;s always sending out on errands. And he&#8217;s a coward. He can never just come to me and say &#8220;I need money again.&#8221; Oh, no, not Victor. Instead he sends that ugly little toady who&#8217;s rude to me and always smells like he hasn&#8217;t washed. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And when I ask what the money&#8217;s for this time, he tells me to ask Victor, and Victor just mumbles and stammers and never gets around to answering. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Victor can be so annoying. He constantly whistles this tuneless song, and when I complain he apologizes and then starts humming it instead. He never stands up to that ill-mannered little hunchback that hersquo;s always sending out on errands. And hersquo;s a coward. He can never just come to me and say ldquo;I need money again.rdquo; Oh, no, not Victor. Instead he sends that ugly little toady whorsquo;s rude to me and always smells like he hasnrsquo;t washed. 

And when I ask what the moneyrsquo;s for this time, he tells me to ask Victor, and Victor just mumbles and stammers and never gets around to answering. 

Rated PG: for spousal annoyances

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The alien is not humanoid. It is not bipedal. It has cilia. It has no bones, or perhaps it does and she cannot feel them. Its muscles, or what might be muscles, are rings and not strands. Its skin is the color of dusk and covered with a clear thin slime that tastes of snot. It makes no sounds. She thinks it smells like wet leaves in winter, but after a time she cannot remember that smell, or leaves, or winter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Its Ins and Outs change. There are dark slashes and permanent knobs that sometimes distend, but it is always growing new Outs, hollowing new Ins. It cleaves easily in both senses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It penetrates her a thousand ways. She penetrates it, as well. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rated X &amp;#8211; Graphic language and sexual situations. Not for kids. Seriously.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It wasn't that Em disapproved of drug use, you just had to be savvy about which drugs you took. Back before she had to get a day job, she was a M@tch girl, much to the delight of the guys on the club scene. M@tch wasn't a wimpy drug, but it didn't turn you into a murderous street zombie either. It was also expensive -- a designer "where it's @!" drug -- that the Tweakers couldn't afford anyway.

Rated R for one sexual scene and drug use.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The objects belonged to them both, but Adriana waved her hand bitterly when Lucian began packing. &#8220;Take whatever you want,&#8221; she said, snapping her book shut. She waited by the door, watching Lucian with sad and angry eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their daughter, Rose, followed Lucian around the house. &#8220;Are you going to take that, Daddy? Do you want that?&#8221; Wordlessly, Lucian held her hand.

But the plane just stopped, and hung there, nose tipped at a slight angle, mere feet from the building.

And that's when the figure -- the one people call the Ambassador, or the Doctor, or the Outsider, or the Professor, or a hundred other names -- appeared. Just a middle-aged man in a white lab coat, with steel-rimmed glasses and graying hair. His image filled the air above the jetliner, like the dome of the sky had been transformed into an IMAX movie screen.

He said, "People of Earth, I have a message for you."

Rated PG  for ennui and futility of life.

Show Notes:

	Tim Pratt is serializing a Marla Mason novel, Broken Mirrors at his website. His first anthology is out this summer from Night Shade Books, Sympathy for the Devil.
Tom Rockwell's work can be found at his personal music website, Devo Spice, The Funny Music Project, and his comedy troupe, Cirque du So What?
Incidentally, Tom Rockwell, myself, and many other Escape Artist writers and narrators will be at NASFiC next week, so check us out if you're in the Raleigh, NC area!

Next weekhellip; Rescue in deep space. And guitar ballads.

"But my name is Simon."

Molly shook her head and chuckled. "With a head of hair like that? Nope, from now on your name is Red."

Simon felt his young face flushing with embarrassment, which would further cement his new nickname. "What if I don't want to be called Red?"

"Too late, should have shaved your head before I bought your contract." Molly winked at him, executed a back flip in mid-air and launched herself out of the Labor Mart. "Come on, Red. We ain't got all day."

Rated PG  for peril and heartbreak and ballads.

I shouldnrsquo;t say anything. Francisco doesnrsquo;t like me to pry.

But he took Apurna to the hospital.

&lt;p&gt;Marv snorted. &amp;#8220;Calendar calculating. They all do that. Not worth a paper dollar, not even in a carnival sideshow.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve heard of it, but &amp;#8212; &amp;#8221; Her blue eyes were wide as a con man&amp;#8217;s smile. &amp;#8220;They can &lt;/em&gt;all&lt;eM&gt; do it?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Sure.&amp;#8221; Marv tilted back, his big wooden chair squeaking. &amp;#8220;All the Counters, anyway. It&amp;#8217;s like the Artists &amp;#8212; &lt;/em&gt;they&lt;em&gt; all draw horses. Or dogs. Which is funny, because back when they got their talents you&amp;#8217;d never see a horse here in the city. Dogs, okay, no big deal.

The young woman, a Ms. Vanessa Kortright-Kingston, untwisted. "No, I mean that he just knows the date like that! As if he could look into the future."

Marv snorted. "Calendar calculating. They all do that. Not worth a paper dollar, not even in a carnival sideshow."

"I've heard of it, but -- " Her blue eyes were wide as a con man's smile. "They can all do it?"

"Sure." Marv tilted back, his big wooden chair squeaking. "All the Counters, anyway. It's like the Artists -- they all draw horses. Or dogs. Which is funny, because back when they got their talents you'd never see a horse here in the city. Dogs, okay, no big deal. But you ask any Artist to sketch you a horse, and blam -- if the damn thing galloped off the paper you wouldn't be surprised."

Her gaze went a bit distant. "That's what I'd like," she said. "To become an artist. Or a musician." 

Rated PG for dreams realized.

They took Johnny Green from class 3a at ten orsquo; clock on Tuesday morning.  He was the last to go. They thought I didnrsquo;t notice, but Irsquo;ve been onto them for a while now. 

It started nearly two weeks ago. Teaching biology is difficult when yoursquo;ve got a teenage audience. Almost every topic on the syllabus has something about reproduction in it, and that reduces your typical youngster to giggles, rude jokes or hysteria. Irsquo;ve got used to it over the last twenty years, and have come to expect the reactions. Irsquo;ve even come to know who to expect them from.

So when Jack Doyle was quiet during my ldquo;Asexual reproduction in amoebardquo; spiel, I knew immediately that something was wrong. And my sense of wrongness really went into overdrive when he stayed behind after class to ask questions.

Rated PG for asexual reproduction and giggling teens.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s not Laura anymore,&amp;#8221; I said. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s Lolo. I&amp;#8217;m gender neutral.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure if the pause that came after that was for dramatic effect or whether she really was having trouble understanding the search parameters. Then she said, &amp;#8220;Ah, I see. When did you do that?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

"Laura," a speaker said, as though I hadn't been gone for six years, as though she'd seen me every day in between. "Laura, where is your uncle?"

I used to imagine her disintegrated, torn apart into silent atoms.

"It's not Laura anymore," I said. "It's Lolo. I'm gender neutral."

"I don't understand," she said.

"You've got a Net connection," I said. "Search around on "gender neutral" and "biomod operation."

I wasn't sure if the pause that came after that was for dramatic effect or whether she really was having trouble understanding the search parameters. Then she said, "Ah, I see. When did you do that?"

"Six years ago."

"Where is your uncle?"

"Dead," I said flatly. I hoped that machine intelligences could hurt and so I twisted the knife as far as I could. "Stabbed in a bar fight."

Rated R for violence, language, and memory of sexual violence. And Spar feedback.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Langton has been under lock-and-key observation since two weeks ago when he sucker punched Paul right in the middle of a publicity shoot for Stars and Stripes at a USO hall in Phoenix. The five of us almost couldn&amp;#8217;t bring him down. The melee wrecked most of our stage props &#8212;  Van De Graff Generators, Tesla Coils, a whole bunch of blinking and flashing, stuff bought from a bankrupt low-budget film studio.  Frida recovered the 30 seconds, or so, of 16mm footage shot that morning. Police found the reporter a few hours later unharmed but minus any memory of the previous two days. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The DC3 taxis to the hangar. Paul joins me at the base of the control tower then the four of us walk down towards the plane. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Hi gang,&amp;#8221; The Corporal says and waves as he lumbers down from the fuselage to the sand. He walks right to Paul. &amp;#8220;How&amp;#8217;s the chin? Sorry about popping you one. I don&amp;#8217;t remember any of it, but Frida says I was a real dope.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paul laughs a little. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s okay. No broken teeth or nothing.&amp;#8221; He rubs his anvil-like jaw with a boxing glove-sized fist. &amp;#8220;Next time I won&amp;#8217;t go easy on you.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I could guess the rest. But Susan, ever the biologist, had her lecture after all. &amp;#8220;It doesn&amp;#8217;t work like that.&amp;#8221; Her voice was gentle, as if she were speaking to one of her two sons, not to Mom. &amp;#8220;A clone isn&amp;#8217;t the same as the original. Your clone would be no more like you than&amp;#8211;than one identical twin is like another. It wouldn&amp;#8217;t be&amp;#8211;&amp;#8221; Susan&amp;#8217;s voice caught. &amp;#8220;It wouldn&amp;#8217;t be you.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;You don&amp;#8217;t _know,_&amp;#8221; Mom said. &amp;#8220;None of the clones are old enough to ask yet. They&amp;#8217;re just babies.&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rated G&lt;/strong&gt;: Not &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; kids, but nothing to worry about if you listen &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; the kids.&lt;/p&gt;

"I know I can't do anything about this--" she gestured toward the tangled blankets, the hospital bed, the pale walls. "But I've asked the doctors to take some cells--I still have a few healthy ones left, you know, and they'll keep for some time--"

I could guess the rest. But Susan, ever the biologist, had her lecture after all. "It doesn't work like that." Her voice was gentle, as if she were speaking to one of her two sons, not to Mom. "A clone isn't the same as the original. Your clone would be no more like you than--than one identical twin is like another. It wouldn't be--" Susan's voice caught. "It wouldn't be you."

"You don't _know,_" Mom said. "None of the clones are old enough to ask yet. They're just babies." 

Rated G: Not for kids, but nothing to worry about if you listen around the kids.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; The only thing I could think of to take my mind off of Sheila, and the crash, was asking my brother about Guj Sarwar, the tiger on the back of the great and mighty lizard, Samarkand.

8th Grade Science Fair Paper Draft

#

Introduction

It happens all the time: you're sitting in class, listening the best you can while Mister Waters goes on and on about atoms or sound waves or whatever, when suddenly you fall asleep. Your head lolls against your shoulder and some drool oozes from the side of your mouth. Luckily, Missy Woo kicks you in the knee to wake you up before someone notices, like Mister Waters or--worse--Austin. 

What's weird is that in those few minutes of sleeping, you dream like hours of stuff. You're all hanging out or playing basketball or walking the mall while everybody else is slowly raising their hands and taking notes. They all get twenty four hours that day, but you get a little extra.

But how much extra? 

Rated PG: For mild drug use.

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Some free fiction coming down from Escape Pod favorites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://craphound.com/?p=3082"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jury Service&lt;/em&gt;: By Cory Doctorow and Charlie Stross (audio only)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; (from Cory&amp;#8217;s blog)&lt;em&gt; Jury Service &lt;/em&gt;is the first of two novellas Charlie Stross and I wrote about Huw, a technophobe stuck on Earth after the Singularity (the other one being &lt;em&gt;Appeals Court&lt;/em&gt;). They are both being published, along with a third, yet-to-be-written novella &lt;em&gt;Parole Board &lt;/em&gt;by Tor Books as R&lt;em&gt;apture of the Nerds&lt;/em&gt;. We&amp;#8217;re starting work on&lt;em&gt; Parole Board&lt;/em&gt; in January, and to refamiliarize myself with the earlier novellas, I&amp;#8217;m going to podcast both now (with the gracious permission of Charlie and our editor, Patrick Nielsen Hayden). Hope you enjoy &amp;#8216;em &amp;#8211; they&amp;#8217;re as gonzo as I&amp;#8217;ve ever gotten, I think! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.timpratt.org/nex/?p=16" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nex&lt;/em&gt;: by Tim Pratt (text and ebook)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; (from Tim&amp;#8217;s blog) Unlike my other serials, this one isn&#8217;t an urban fantasy, and doesn&#8217;t take place in an existing series (though it does share a setting with a story, as I mentioned). It&#8217;s a novel narrated by a precocious 13-year-old who finds herself a long way from home with some disreputable people in a dangerous world. The book has shapeshifters, giant robots, aliens, kleptomaniacal monsters, heroism, shoplifting, terror, lecherous cyborgs, personable tyrants, steampunk submarines, subterranean tunnels, rustic French cuisine, a cult of teenage girls in fairy wings and leotards, teleportation, and people who get punched so hard they &lt;em&gt;disappear&lt;/em&gt;. I hope you all like it. &lt;em&gt;[Ed- this is a free online book, so please support the author with a &lt;a href="http://www.timpratt.org/nex/?page_id=2" target="_blank"&gt;donation&lt;/a&gt; or a purchase of the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0045JL56K" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle ebook&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;span style="color: #ff0000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;- apologies, WordPress put the Doctorow file into our feed without me realizing, sorry for those of you who downloaded unwanted content. I've removed it, now you must right-click to download or go directly to Doctorow's page.]&lt;/p&gt;

What you love about Escape Pod &amp;#8211; free stories every Thursday &amp;#8211; is not changing. At all. We&amp;#8217;re not removing things as a change, we&amp;#8217;re adding things.

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hi SF fans!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to talk about some changes that are happening here at Escape Pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First: DON&amp;#8217;T PANIC. What you love about Escape Pod &amp;#8211; free stories every Thursday &amp;#8211; is not changing. At all. We&amp;#8217;re not removing things as a change, we&amp;#8217;re adding things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second: For a while, this site has been little more than a delivery device for the podcast. But now we&amp;#8217;re going to add commentary, reviews, and news. We need help, though. If you&amp;#8217;re interested in volunteering material for the blog, simply &lt;a href="mailto:editor@escapepod.org" target="_blank"&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt; and let me know what you&amp;#8217;d like to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third: &lt;strong&gt;Escape Pod is raising its rates. &lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;#8217;s right folks, we&amp;#8217;re shooting for the stars and going for an SFWA pro rate format. We&amp;#8217;ll be paying $.05 a word for new stories (maximum $300), $.03 a word for reprints (minimum $100). We&amp;#8217;re doing this for a couple of reasons- authors deserve to be paid, of course. We&amp;#8217;re hoping we can attract a greater caliber of authors, which will therefore grow our audience. Along with the rate increase, we&amp;#8217;ll be asking for ebook rights to the stories so we can print them on our site, which will bring in a bigger audience. &lt;strong&gt;The rate increase will start with stories I accept after October 1, 2010. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A side note- &lt;strong&gt;we&amp;#8217;ll only be able to pay pro rates if the donations help us do so.&lt;/strong&gt; we&amp;#8217;re doing a six month trial; if our donations stay strong, it&amp;#8217;ll be a permanent change for 2011, if they don&amp;#8217;t, then in April we will drop back down to $100 a story. &lt;strong&gt;This depends on your support of the site.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternately, if you&amp;#8217;re a media publisher of any kind &amp;#8212; television, movies, video games, a book seller, or just an indie author who wants to sponsor Escape Pod, that will help us out while also promoting you to tens of thousands of listeners.  You can email amanda at escapeartists.net for current rates and details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;A takeover of your company with the state your market shares are in is not unreasonable.&amp;#8221; Although Soaces was right, there&amp;#8217;d be precious little profit, even after he&amp;#8217;d liquidated all of Renewal&amp;#8217;s assets and released the employees.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;There&amp;#8217;s more to the company than the money. You&amp;#8217;ll eliminate so many people&amp;#8217;s livelihoods. Good people. Without Renewal, some of them won&amp;#8217;t have any other alternatives.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

"A takeover of your company with the state your market shares are in is not unreasonable." Although Soaces was right, there'd be precious little profit, even after he'd liquidated all of Renewal's assets and released the employees. But that wasn't why he wanted it.

"You're going to destroy us, aren't you? Tear us apart and sell us to the highest bidder."

"That's the plan."

"There's more to the company than the money. You'll eliminate so many people's livelihoods. Good people. Without Renewal, some of them won't have any other alternatives."

"Alternative to what? Luddite jobs? Machine labor?" He chose his next words, enunciating each syllable with relish. "It's all they're good for, isn't it? Can't have the un-teched getting above their station."

Portia dropped her gaze.  "I never said that."

"But you didn't deny it."

Rated PG: For mild sexual situations.

Yes, it&amp;#8217;s the end of the day, but I&amp;#8217;m getting in on time! 10/10/10 (today&amp;#8217;s date) is 42 in binary, and any good geek knows that 42 is [...]</description>
			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hey, you sass that hoopy Douglas Adams. He was a frood who really knew where his towel was. And what the answer to the ultimate question was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it&amp;#8217;s the end of the day, but I&amp;#8217;m getting in on time! 10/10/10 (today&amp;#8217;s date) is 42 in binary, and any good geek knows that 42 is the answer to the ultimate question, the question of life, the universe, and everything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Douglas Adams died far too early in 2001, and ever since there have been days to commemorate him, including National Towel Day (May 25). If, by odd chance you don&amp;#8217;t know Adams&amp;#8217; work, starting with the classic Hitchiker&amp;#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy, or, if you&amp;#8217;re a fan of Norse gods or time travel, the Dirk Gently series is bizarre and wonderful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Douglas became the symbolic pillar of seizing the day to me and my husband. Around 1998, we were at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta, GA, and he was there promoting Starship Titanic. As shy geeks, we huddled together whispering, &amp;#8220;oh look it&amp;#8217;s Douglas Adams, oh man, let&amp;#8217;s go talk to him, he&amp;#8217;s tall! I don&amp;#8217;t know what to say, I&amp;#8217;m too shy!&amp;#8221; We walked through the convention center until we decided no, we were wusses, we had to turn around and go back and say hi. Who knew when we&amp;#8217;d get a chance to see him again? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time we got back to the booth, he was gone, headed to the airport to go back to England. We expressed dismay, and the woman at the booth was incredibly kind and actually gave us a copy of the game to make it up to us. Three short years later, he was dead of a sudden heart attack, and to this day we kick ourselves for being too shy to even say hi to the man whose writing touched so many geeks of our generation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We miss you, Douglas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, the EP staff reads more than slush and short stories. I picked up &lt;a href="http://www.kyliechan.com/books.cfm?series=1&amp;amp;book=1" target="_blank"&gt;White Tiger by Kylie Chan&lt;/a&gt; at the Voyager party at WorldCon last month and have been eager to check it out. I study Southern Shao Lin kung fu and love stories that incorporate martial arts. I&amp;#8217;m starting it today and will report back. (Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s fantasy, I can be well balanced. I read both kinds of fiction, science fiction AND fantasy.*)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently finished books include The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman, The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins, and The Alchemist and the Executioness, linked novellas by Paolo Bacigalupi and Tobias Buckell. And I do realize that blogging these books will indicate which books I&amp;#8217;m sorely behind on reading, but hey, we can&amp;#8217;t read everything the moment it comes out, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(*Paraphrase of this &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSZfUnCK5qk"&gt;The Blues Brothers classic line&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I received a note from Helen Marshall who is working on a campaign to save the Sunburst Award, the Canadian juried speculative fiction award. Seeing as how Canada has brought us authors such as Minister Faust, Jo Walton, Spider Robinson, and Cory Doctorow (to name a few), I&amp;#8217;m greatly inclined to help them out. Please check out her request and see if you can support their cause! (note the deadline is this friday, so you don&amp;#8217;t have much time!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sunburst Award for Canadian Literature of the Fantastic is a juried award based on excellence of writing in two categories: adult and young adult. The awards are presented annually to Canadian writers with a speculative fiction novel or book-length collection of speculative fiction published any time during the previous calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Sunburst Awards have run into a hiccup.  They do not have enough operating capital to keep going as they currently stand. This sad news comes at a particularly critical juncture in the award&amp;#8217;s life&amp;#8211;the operating committee is in the process of getting the Sunburst organization registered as a non-profit, and getting it &amp;#8220;national arts organization&amp;#8221; status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a fundraising drive to shepherd the Sunburst through this change of status and structure, we&#8217;d like to ask fans, writers, editors, and publishers from the speculative fiction community to help raise awareness of this vital institution&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Participate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re looking for short (30 second to 2 minutes) videos that say what you think about Canadian speculative fiction. These should be interview-style videos in the vein of Speaker&amp;#8217;s Corner and can be recorded as simply as with a web camera. Prior interviews or footage can be submitted provided that you have permission to do so.  We will host these individually on a YouTube channel (sunburstaward), but will also edit them in order to create a series of short videos to promote awareness of the fundraising campaign. A longer video will be shown at the opening remarks to the Toronto SpecFic Colloquium. Check out what we&amp;#8217;ve got so far!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not savvy with a camera? Send us a high res image of yourself and either a short paragraph in text or a recorded audio track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Canadian? Never fear. If you have something you want to say about Canadian speculative fiction then we want to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To participate, send your name, contact information, submission and a short release statement giving us permission to use the video/image to sunburstvideo@gmail.com by October 15, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible Topics:&lt;br /&gt;
-favourite Canadian authors and/or stories&lt;br /&gt;
-the relationship between Canadian writing and the rest of the world&lt;br /&gt;
-publishing speculative fiction in Canada&lt;br /&gt;
-the state of Canadian fantasy, science fiction, horror, etc&lt;br /&gt;
-how does Canada inspire your work?&lt;br /&gt;
-favourite Canadian settings to use in your writing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, these topics are intended to be a jumping off point. Feel free to think outside of the box. And, above all, show your&lt;br /&gt;
enthusiasm!&lt;/p&gt;

Captain Harash was its last occupant, the last living man from Earth, and both he and Duxa knew he was dying.

"It's time, Duxa," he told her.

She checked the output from his lifechair. While it was still replicating most of his bodily functions for him he did not seem appreciably worse than when she'd last monitored him, less than half a second before.

"We're not at our destination yet, Captain."

"You'll make it there without me, Duxa."

And the processors that she must have built but could never quite find -- she was enormously bulky, and by now some of her was a mystery even unto herself -- created an awkward sensation. Duxa told him: "I will be lonely without you."

"And that's good," Harash said.

"You wish me pain?" Duxa asked him.

"No. I wish for you to feel. I wish," and he paused here, his lips making the smacking noises she knew indicated a loss of reflexive controls as the plague made its way through his cranial nerves, "I wish that there were more things that you could feel, Duxa."

"I think I feel quite a lot."

Harash laughed, a coughing sound. "All teenagers do. Remember that, should you actually feel someday, that the white hot intensity fades, but to keep the embers stoking."


Rated PG: For brief violence, the death of tentacled creatures, and the end of the world as we know it.

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I feel like my first post of the new Escape-Pod-has-a-real-blog era should be full of originality and in no way derivative of prior works, but we just don&amp;#8217;t have that kind of time out on this arm of the spiraling blogosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this morning I read The Guardian&amp;#8217;s quite interesting&#160;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/oct/09/insane-clown-posse-christians-god"&gt;profile of Insane Clown Posse&lt;/a&gt;, which I had honestly thought was actually in the vein of Weird Al Yankovic when I first saw the Miracles video (&amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/f-cking-magnets-how-do-they-work"&gt;F#cking Magnets, how do they work&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;#8221;) oh so many months ago without any of the needed context (actual &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGbdomlBnJM"&gt;Weird Al Yankovic-esque version here&lt;/a&gt;). The reality is, as it is so often, much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Well,&amp;#8221; Violent J says, &amp;#8220;science is&#8230; we don&amp;#8217;t really&#8230; that&amp;#8217;s like&#8230;&amp;#8221; He pauses. Then he waves his hands as if to say, &amp;#8220;OK, an analogy&amp;#8221;: &amp;#8220;If you&amp;#8217;re trying to fuck a girl, but her mom&amp;#8217;s home, fuck her mom! You understand? You want to fuck the girl, but her mom&amp;#8217;s home? Fuck the mom. See?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look blankly at him. &amp;#8220;You mean&#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Now, you don&amp;#8217;t really feel that way,&amp;#8221; Violent J says. &amp;#8220;You don&amp;#8217;t really hate her mom. But for this moment when you&amp;#8217;re trying to fuck this girl, fuck her! And that&amp;#8217;s what we mean when we say fuck scientists. Sometimes they kill all the cool mysteries away. When I was a kid, they couldn&amp;#8217;t tell you how pyramids were made&#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Like Stonehenge and Easter Island,&amp;#8221; says Shaggy. &amp;#8220;Nobody knows how that shit got there.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;But since then, scientists go, &amp;#8216;I&amp;#8217;ve got an explanation for that.&amp;#8217; It&amp;#8217;s like, fuck you! I like to believe it was something out of this world.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#8217;ll hazard a guess that if you&amp;#8217;re taking the time out of your busy week to listen to a science fiction podcast that you&amp;#8217;re probably a big believer in Science as a source of wonderment. &#160;I mean, it&amp;#8217;s given us things like &lt;a href="http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/"&gt;CERN&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2010/10/the_national_ignition_facility.html"&gt;National Ignition Facility&lt;/a&gt;, both of which have to be some of the coolest science happening &lt;a href="http://io9.com/5663237/"&gt;within a few dozen parsecs of Earth&lt;/a&gt;. But really what the profile reminded me of was Jo Walton&amp;#8217;s post over at Tor about the &lt;a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2009/07/apollo-11-and-science-fiction-and-me"&gt;Moon landing and a backyard party&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was at an outdoor party once. There was a beautiful full moon sailing above the trees, above the whole planet.  And there was a guy at the party who proclaimed loudly that the boots of the Apollo astronauts had contaminated the magic of the moon and that it should have been left untouched.  I disagreed really strongly. I felt that the fact that people had visited the moon made it a real place, while not stopping it being beautiful. There it was, after all, shining silver, and the thought that people had been there, that I could potentially go there one day, made it better for me. That guy wanted it to be a fantasy moon, and I wanted it to be a science fiction moon. And that&#8217;s how the day of the moon landing affected me and my relationship with science fiction, twenty years after it happened. It gave me a science fiction moon, full of wonder and beauty and potentially within my grasp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is is an observation that I&amp;#8217;ve turned over in my head many times since I first read it so many months ago. Though I&amp;#8217;m quite skeptical that the opposite of science fiction is actually fantasy and not a more modern mysticism&#185;, but the point is that the stars are no more tarnished by our ability to begin to &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/10/gliese581g-may-not-exist/"&gt;identify the planets&lt;/a&gt; among them in than the myths of the great sea monsters of old are tarnished by our discoveries of the &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/biub6/my_god_its_a_monster/"&gt;real monsters of the deep&lt;/a&gt;. But for some the thought that all is not explicable is comforting, and I&amp;#8217;ve always thought that part of science fiction&amp;#8217;s job is to break down that belief that wonder is only found with a lack of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&#185;Overseeing the slush pile here at Escape Pod I know we get a lot of stories that are edge cases between us and Podcastle, and I&amp;#8217;d argue that fantasy as a genre doesn&amp;#8217;t really tolerate stories where the explanation for events or occurrences is truly lacking, it&amp;#8217;s just that fantasy&amp;#8217;s toolkit is a spellbook, and ours is a physics text. The explanation still has to exist in fantasy, whereas with these more modern mystics they seem to prefer no explanation whatsoever, merely the end product at which to marvel.&lt;/p&gt;

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#8217;t take much of an excuse for me to want to Talk About Doctor Who. Really, it doesn&amp;#8217;t. But this is quite a &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/11/the-doctor-is-in/8248"&gt;nice love letter to the series&lt;/a&gt; from James Parker over at The Atlantic, and I&amp;#8217;ll take the chance it presents &#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000000;"&gt;This is all meat and drink to the 21st-century viewer, who has no idea who he is either. We are now entering the era of post-secular television&#8212;of Lost and Heroes, of time loops, unearthly powers, chaotic entrances into parallel dimensions&#8212;and the Doctor and his wheezing sci-fi are, finally, bang up-to-date.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8212; to talk about the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/oct/12/doctor-who-immortal-reveals-bbc"&gt;latest kerfuffle in the Whoverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On its face it&amp;#8217;s not the worse thing to befall speculative fiction that the Doctor is immortal. On a purely production level, a show that&amp;#8217;s been going off and on for about a half century doesn&amp;#8217;t seem like it would be tripped up by a little thing like losing the main character (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_(Doctor_Who)"&gt;Ahem&lt;/a&gt;), but reaction to the change in canon (oddly made in the CBBC&amp;#8217;s Sarah Jane Adventures) has been &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/oct/12/doctor-who-immortal-reveals-bbc"&gt;mainly critical on story grounds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which seems odd to me, after all it&amp;#8217;s not like english literature doesn&amp;#8217;t have its fair share of immortal characters dotted across the landscape. The show even has its own &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Harkness#Face_of_Boe"&gt;character who is, for all intents and purposes, immortal&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps the Doctor will come upon the day where life really does begin to seem like butter over too much bread. In the last season he certainly made it clear that the TARDIS has let him skip the boring days, and that he would have a difficult time living a normal life, without the Daleks to defeat and silences to break. Maybe someday the &lt;a href="http://io9.com/5665697/man-discovers-dalek-in-the-rings-of-a-tree-claims-its-jesus"&gt;Daleks&amp;#8217; latest invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the galaxy at l&#160;won&amp;#8217;t be quite interesting enough to stop and he&amp;#8217;ll go west, but having the character&amp;#8217;s end be of his own choosing or the tragedy of a too-quick death won&amp;#8217;t dispel the magic of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, it does seem to run counter to the arc of the last few Doctors since the restart, who, despite being on the younger end of the Doctor-Actor range spectrum, have increasingly noted their age and general universe-weariness (though, really, given that Doctor #1 was 950ish, and Doctor #11 is still 950ish, I&amp;#8217;m not sure how much he&amp;#8217;s actually aged, except possibly emotionally). Perhaps the closest match to an immortal Doctor would be &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_(comics)"&gt;Dream&lt;/a&gt; of the Endless (though, let&amp;#8217;s face it, in terms of cool-factor he&amp;#8217;s probably a bit more of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_(DC_Comics)"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;). Immortal characters still have arcs, and given the relatively short time frames of most works of literature it&amp;#8217;s hardly like a character&amp;#8217;s oncoming death is a critical motivator of plots.&#160;For the Doctor, life has always been about constant movement, especially since the loss of Gallifrey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus on the character&amp;#8217;s final death misses the fact, entrenched in series since the reboot, that each regeneration is really a death in and of itself. Look at the anguish of Ten&amp;#8217;s last few episodes, or the quiet sadness that met the regeneration of Nine. To see the Doctor&amp;#8217;s final death as the only real one for the purposes of the story is missing the trees for the forest.&lt;/p&gt;

Issue 1&lt;br /&gt;
Written by Mark Millar&lt;br /&gt;
Drawn by Leinil Francis Yu&lt;br /&gt;
Inks by Gerry Alanguilan&lt;br /&gt;
Colors by Dave McCaig&lt;br /&gt;
Lettering by VC&#8217;s Clayton Cowles&lt;br /&gt;
Edited by John Barber&lt;br /&gt;
Published by Marvel (Icon)&lt;br /&gt;
$2.95&lt;br /&gt;
Out now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Pooni has multiple sclerosis, a body that&#8217;s rebelling against him and exactly one friend, Chris.  Every week they go and see a movie, every week they chat and every week Simon gets a little sicker, a little further away.  What matters though is that for two hours he&#8217;s somewhere else, transported away from his body and into the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he meets Ormon, a monkey wearing a spacesuit, who makes him an offer&#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superior is the latest title from Mark Millar, write of Kick-Ass, Nemesis and numerous other titles and, like every Millar comic, it&#8217;s surrounded by a corona of hype and bile that resembles nothing more than a circus tent being set alight by an angry crowd who are paying for the privilege of doing so.  Millar is a controversial writer, certainly, but this review isn&#8217;t about Millar, it&#8217;s about Superior and the more I think about it, the more I realize it&#8217;s about that moment of escape where pop culture grabs you and holds you and takes you away with it.  That&#8217;s the moment the circuit closes, the moment everything is a little brighter, the moment the guitars kick in.  Everyone has countless variations on that moment and for me, they&#8217;ve included President Bartlet&#8217;s first appearance in The West Wing, the final line in Daredevil and Liz Lemon rolling her eyes and yelling &#8216;Son of a MOTHER!;&#8217;  Everyone is different, everyone is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon&#8217;s moment comes when he looks at the movie version of Superior (Endearingly, they&#8217;re watching Superior 5) and doesn&#8217;t see the old fashioned heroics, hackneyed plots and CGI that Chris does.  Instead, Simon sees someone who is strong, upright, capable where he&#8217;s not, free where he&#8217;s restrained.  Superior is everything Simon isn&#8217;t and everything he desperately wants to be.  What happens when he&#8217;s given everything he wants and how it affects his world remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millar&#8217;s script is expansive and decompressed but there&#8217;s a sense of weight here, as we deftly get Simon and Chris&#8217; friendship, Simon&#8217;s past, his relationship with his mother and Superior&#8217;s place in the world neatly established.  It feels a little like a movie treatment but that&#8217;s more in the subject matter than the delivery and Millar takes to this sort of expansive, almost universal storytelling remarkably well.  The art team are on top form, Leinil Francis Yu&#8217;s sharp, beefy lines expressive, fast but always detailed and with real weight, all neatly grounded by Dave McCaig&#8217;s colours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, Superior looks beautiful, feels confident and assured and is about as good as first issues come.  It&#8217;s a good story, well told and that&#8217;s all that matters when it comes down to it.  Well, that and the spacesuited monkey, that&#8217;s the icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next week&amp;#8230; &lt;/strong&gt;Halloween episode!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUEL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The third quarter report cards came out Thursday, and for Jamie, the timing couldn&amp;#8217;t have been worse.  The Nike man was coming over that night to sell his brother some new blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He took his time walking home from Gilder Middle School, weaving past cracks in the sidewalk and mud puddles left behind by the spring thaw.  His pace slowed further as he turned onto Willow Avenue and saw his house, second on the left, a red brick ranch with spidery ivy growing up the east side.  Old leaves, fallen tree branches, and other detritus left over from the winter littered the front yard.  As he neared, he noted with dismay his father&amp;#8217;s car already in the driveway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Damn.&amp;#8221;  Jamie trudged across the yard and let himself in the front door with his keycard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad was at the hall closet, hanging up his overcoat.  He stood just under two meters tall; a navy blue business suit wrapped his muscled frame.  He beamed when he saw Jamie.  &amp;#8220;Hey there, kiddo.  How was school today?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;re home early,&amp;#8221; Jamie said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Need to get ready for the presentation tonight.  And I&amp;#8217;d like you to clean up the front yard.  Make sure you use the dirt rake to get up that thatch.  Will you do that for me?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie opened his mouth to protest, but thought the better of it.  &amp;#8220;Sure,&amp;#8221; he said.  He unslung his backpack and headed for the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Oh.  By the way.&amp;#8221;  Dad fished in a suit pocket and produced a folded piece of paper.  &amp;#8220;I got this in my email today.&amp;#8221;  He opened the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaime recognized the school&amp;#8217;s letterhead on the printout.  He slumped, leaning against the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad tapped the paper.  &amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s this C-plus in Basic Fitness about, kiddo?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://escapepod.org/2010/10/21/ep263-fuel/"&gt;Read more&amp;#8230;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-1034"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I got A&amp;#8217;s in my academic classes.  They&amp;#8217;re all honors courses, too.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I can see that.  But we&amp;#8217;ve talked about Fitness before, haven&amp;#8217;t we?&amp;#8221;  Dad looked down at him with a disapproving arch of an eyebrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Yes.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;So tell me.  What happened?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s nothing.  I&amp;#8217;ll do better next quarter.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Did you fail the agility drills again?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I couldn&amp;#8217;t do the pull-ups.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad pressed his lips together and took a breath.  &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m not sure you&amp;#8217;re giving it your best effort, Jamie.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I am.  I really am.  I&amp;#8217;m just not very good at sports.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You get better with practice.  Like your brother Scott.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie nodded, keeping his gaze down, hoping Dad didn&amp;#8217;t notice the way he gritted his teeth when he heard his older brother&amp;#8217;s name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad clapped him on the shoulder.  &amp;#8220;Jamie, you&amp;#8217;re twelve years old now.  It&amp;#8217;s really important that you find your best sport.  College recruiters are already contacting boys your age.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie thought of his best friend Russell, who had just gotten his first recruiting letter the other day, from Penn State.  Jamie hung his head even lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;All I&amp;#8217;m asking is that you try, son.  Will you do that for me?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie nodded again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad folded up the grade printout and stuffed it into a pocket.  &amp;#8220;Hey, I have an idea.  Why don&amp;#8217;t you sit in on the presentation tonight?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Oh, man.&amp;#8221;  Jamie looked up.  &amp;#8220;Do I have to, Dad?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Why not?  Maybe you&amp;#8217;ll hear something you like.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A groan escaped Jamie.  He had homework to do for Advanced Literature&amp;#8211;the next two chapters of _Dracula_, which he&amp;#8217;d loved so far.  But experience had taught him not to proffer academic work as an excuse.  &amp;#8220;Why don&amp;#8217;t you guys just order Scott&amp;#8217;s blood online?  That&amp;#8217;s what you usually do.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Nike representative wants to show us some new and improved stuff.  The best yet.  Scott has regionals in two weeks, you know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;So.  You&amp;#8217;ll be there tonight, then?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Sure, Dad.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad clapped him on the shoulder again.  &amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s the spirit.  Now let&amp;#8217;s get that yard picked up, OK?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie went upstairs to change out of his school clothes before getting to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Fuel 6.1 is our latest release, and our best,&amp;#8221; the Nike man said.  &amp;#8220;You can see from the charts how our refined erythrocyte design maximizes oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange, nutrient absorption, and hormone capacity.  You folks have probably read about all that stuff already; it was part of the 6.0 rollout.  But 6.1 also features enhanced thrombocyte function that increases fibrinogen production by as much as fifty percent.  It lasts longer than 6.0, too.  You can go up to four weeks without a new transfusion.  And of course, Fuel still has the highest-quality, FDA-approved leukocytes and plasma substitutes available on the market.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nike man topped two meters, taller than even Dad.  He had dark hair streaked blonde.  His skin was so deeply tanned that Jamie could swear it glowed.  The salesman&amp;#8217;s hands seemed huge, each big enough on its own to comfortably grip a basketball.  He wore an immaculate black workout singlesuit that flowed with his movements.  And he had the shoes, of course.  Top of the line SuperJumps, solid black, like the suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made his pitch in the living room, with the aid of handouts and multimedia charts from a display that stood on its own tripod.  Mom and Dad, seated on the couch, paid close attention, nodding at appropriate times, asking occasional questions, laughing at the salesman&amp;#8217;s jokes.  Scott, just turned sixteen, long-legged and lanky, slumped between them with his arms crossed.  His gaze wandered as the Nike man talked.  Jamie sat in the rocking chair to one side, next to the bookcase filled with Scott&amp;#8217;s track trophies and medals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nike man continued:  &amp;#8220;Athletes using Fuel 6.1 have shown documented increases in metabolism, endurance, and recovery from injury.  And if you purchase tonight, we&amp;#8217;ll even throw in a free home transfusion kit.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie shook his head.  Scott already had one of those.  Jamie had set it up for him many times, usually on nights before track meets.  Jamie had grown more proficient working the kit than his parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He glanced at the clock on the wall.  The time was just after seven o&amp;#8217;clock.  If the Nike man finished his spiel in the next hour, Jamie would still be able to do some of his Advanced Lit homework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Wow,&amp;#8221; Dad said, smiling and nodding.  &amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s something, isn&amp;#8217;t it, Scott?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I guess,&amp;#8221; Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nike man gave an amused smile.  &amp;#8220;You don&amp;#8217;t sound convinced.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m a sprinter.  I don&amp;#8217;t care about all that endurance stuff.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s your forty time, Scott?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Four-one-five.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Not bad.  But suppose I were to tell you that Fuel 6.1 can improve your personal best by as much as a full second?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Yeah, right,&amp;#8221; Scott said.  &amp;#8220;Whatever.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Regionals are only two weeks away, honey,&amp;#8221; Mom said.  She was small and wiry, with closely cropped hair and an angular face.  She still wore work clothes&amp;#8211;white top, pinstriped jacket and skirt, heels.  &amp;#8220;And didn&amp;#8217;t your coach say you need to get under four seconds if you want to&amp;#8211;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott cut her off with an exasperated sigh and a roll of his eyes.  An awkward silence fell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nike man turned toward Jamie in the rocking chair.  &amp;#8220;How about you, Jimmy?  This stuff is pretty cool, huh?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Uh . . . it&amp;#8217;s _Jamie_.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nike man put on a let&#8217;s-be-friends smile.  &amp;#8220;Do you think you would like to try Fuel?  I&amp;#8217;ll bet you&amp;#8217;d like it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The salesman&amp;#8217;s radiant good health made Jamie uncomfortably conscious of the paunch around his middle.  &amp;#8220;Um . . . no, thanks.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Why not?  This is quality stuff, you know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a sidelong glance toward his parents, Jamie said, &amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s OK.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nike man&#8217;s smile became indulgent.  &amp;#8220;I understand, Jamie.  You think that you could never be an athlete like your brother, or all the other kids.  But 6.1 could be the key for you.  Blood _is_ just like fuel, you know.  The better the fuel, the better your body will work.  In no time at all, you could be running track like your brother&amp;#8211;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott laughed.  Mom shushed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;&amp;#8211;or, with your size, maybe playing football.  I could see you fitting in well at guard, or possibly even center.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You know, that&amp;#8217;s what I keep telling him,&amp;#8221; Dad said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie&amp;#8217;s cheeks burned.  Why couldn&amp;#8217;t the guy just leave him alone and get on with the presentation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nike man said, &amp;#8220;You really shouldn&amp;#8217;t overlook the benefits of athletic competition.  Athletes are much less likely to get involved with drugs or alcohol, or drop out of school.  You might even get to attend college on an athletic scholarship, if you&amp;#8217;re good enough.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Will it make me smarter?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad cleared his throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nike man cast a puzzled glance toward the couch.  &amp;#8220;Well . . . Fuel is designed to enhance _athletic_ performance.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He&amp;#8217;s taking all _academic_ classes,&amp;#8221; Scott said with a sneer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I see.&amp;#8221;  The Nike man&amp;#8217;s smile thinned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He&amp;#8217;s still taking Basic Fitness.  And he hasn&amp;#8217;t even started his Nutrition courses.  Hell, when I was Jamie&amp;#8217;s age, I had already gone through Advanced Conditioning.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re, ah, we&amp;#8217;re very proud of him.&amp;#8221;  Mom, glancing uneasily at Jamie, patted Scott&amp;#8217;s knee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll bet.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie glowered at his smirking brother.  &amp;#8220;I got A&amp;#8217;s in all my honors courses this quarter.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nike man said, &amp;#8220;Jamie, academic scholarships are mighty hard to come by these days.  Take it from me, most schools just don&amp;#8217;t have the necessary funding.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie looked at the floor.  In a mumble, he said, &amp;#8220;I guess I don&amp;#8217;t care.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m sorry, Jamie; I missed that.  What did you say?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie&amp;#8217;s mouth drew tight, like a drawstring bag.  The collective stare of his parents, his brother, and the Nike man weighed on him, suffusing him with a deep weariness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Jamie?  What did you say?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He raised his chin, scowling.  &amp;#8220;I said, _I don&amp;#8217;t care_.  All right?  You happy now?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nike man took a step backward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t like football.  Get it?  I don&amp;#8217;t like track, either.  I don&amp;#8217;t like sports.  I got A&amp;#8217;s in all my honors courses.  Now will you just leave me alone?  Please?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His heart raced.  He breathed heavily, as if he&amp;#8217;d just run around the block.  He wondered at his own words.  Had he actually just spoken them in front of his parents?  He turned to the couch, suddenly terrified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Jee-_zus_.&amp;#8221;  Scott stood suddenly.  &amp;#8220;Do I have to stay down here and listen to this crap, Dad?  You&amp;#8217;ve already ordered my blood.  This guy&amp;#8217;s just here to talk to Jamie, anyway.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Scott, you be _quiet_!&amp;#8221;  Mom glared at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Why?  It&amp;#8217;s true, isn&amp;#8217;t it?  You&amp;#8217;re just trying to get him with the program.  Waste of time, if you ask me.  His buddy&amp;#8217;s already getting scholarship offers, and fat little Jamie just hides in his books.  He&amp;#8217;s a friggin&amp;#8217; loser.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad stood, too.  His face was stern.  &amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s enough out of you, young man.  You may go to your room.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott set hands on hips.  &amp;#8220;And what if I don&amp;#8217;t?  You gonna ground me?  I have regionals in two weeks.  You wouldn&amp;#8217;t want me to miss practice, would you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mom and Dad exchanged glances.  The Nike man looked at his perfect shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Shit.  I&amp;#8217;m going over to Kevin&amp;#8217;s.&amp;#8221;  Scott stormed out the front door, slamming it hard enough to rattle the windows.  One of Mom&amp;#8217;s ceramic angel figurines fell from the knickknack shelf.  The carpet cushioned its fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie gaped at his parents.  Neither one would meet his gaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he understood why the Nike man was here.  Why his parents hadn&amp;#8217;t just ordered the new blood online, as they usually did.  Why Dad had insisted on Jamie being present for the presentation.  Why the Nike man had focused so much attention on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie looked around the room.  His gaze found the multimedia display on its tripod, charting the performance-enhancing benefits of Fuel.  He had never felt so alone in all his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly, he got to his feet.  His throat double-clutched.  &amp;#8220;I think . . . I&amp;#8217;m gonna be sick.&amp;#8221;  He headed for the bathroom on unsteady legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun had long since set before a timid knock came at Jamie&amp;#8217;s bedroom door.  It opened, and Mom entered.  In the darkness, she was only a silhouette.  &amp;#8220;Jamie?  Are you awake?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He lay supine on his bed.  &amp;#8220;Yeah.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She sat on the edge of the bed.  &amp;#8220;Honey, I&amp;#8217;m so sorry about what happened tonight.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s okay, Mom.  I&amp;#8217;m sorry, too.  For what I said.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Your father and I just don&amp;#8217;t want you to miss out on any opportunities.  Your friend Russell&amp;#8211;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking, Mom.  I&amp;#8217;d like to try the new blood.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You would?&amp;#8221;  She put a hand on his arm.  &amp;#8220;Oh, Jamie, are you sure?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m sure.  Can we still get the free transfusion kit?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Well, actually . . . we hoped you would change your mind.  We ordered the blood for you.  The kit&amp;#8217;s downstairs.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Oh.  Good.  Is it very much different from Scott&amp;#8217;s?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Looks the same, I think.  You should be able to assemble it yourself.  You&amp;#8217;ll probably be able to do your own transfusions, even.&amp;#8221;  She leaned over and kissed his forehead.  &amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;re growing up.  Your father and I are very proud of you.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie was grateful for the darkness, so that his mother could not see his face twist with pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You get some sleep now,&amp;#8221; Mom said.  She stood and looked down at him for a moment.  Jamie imagined that she was probably smiling.  Then she left, quietly shutting the door behind her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tears threatened, but Jamie fought them down.  He had much too much to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his first transfusion, he would have a whole body&amp;#8217;s worth of blood left over.  _Normal_ blood.  Usually, it was sent to the Nike people for recycling.  But if Jamie could somehow hide it instead&amp;#8211;store it in the basement freezer, maybe&amp;#8211;then . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regionals were only two weeks away.  Scott would do a fresh transfusion the night before; he always did.  Jamie would help him with it, as usual.  And he and Scott had the same blood type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the darkness, Jamie smiled.  The Nike man had called it Fuel.  Well, knowledge was a kind of fuel, too.  Mom and Dad and Scott didn&amp;#8217;t understand that.  Not yet, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He would get in serious trouble, of course.  But it would be worth the punishment if, only for a moment, they would understand him at last.  It would ease the loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still smiling, Jamie drifted off to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

FUEL
The third quarter report cards came out Thursday, and for Jamie, the timing couldn't have been worse.  The Nike man was coming over that night to sell his brother some new blood.

He took his time walking home from Gilder Middle School, weaving past cracks in the sidewalk and mud puddles left behind by the spring thaw.  His pace slowed further as he turned onto Willow Avenue and saw his house, second on the left, a red brick ranch with spidery ivy growing up the east side.  Old leaves, fallen tree branches, and other detritus left over from the winter littered the front yard.  As he neared, he noted with dismay his father's car already in the driveway.

"Damn."  Jamie trudged across the yard and let himself in the front door with his keycard.

Dad was at the hall closet, hanging up his overcoat.  He stood just under two meters tall; a navy blue business suit wrapped his muscled frame.  He beamed when he saw Jamie.  "Hey there, kiddo.  How was school today?"

"You're home early," Jamie said.

"Need to get ready for the presentation tonight.  And I'd like you to clean up the front yard.  Make sure you use the dirt rake to get up that thatch.  Will you do that for me?"

Jamie opened his mouth to protest, but thought the better of it.  "Sure," he said.  He unslung his backpack and headed for the stairs.

"Oh.  By the way."  Dad fished in a suit pocket and produced a folded piece of paper.  "I got this in my email today."  He opened the paper.

Jaime recognized the school's letterhead on the printout.  He slumped, leaning against the wall.

Dad tapped the paper.  "What's this C-plus in Basic Fitness about, kiddo?"

"I got A's in my academic classes.  They're all honors courses, too."

"I can see that.  But we've talked about Fitness before, haven't we?"  Dad looked down at him with a disapproving arch of an eyebrow.

"Yes."

"So tell me.  What happened?"

"It's nothing.  I'll do better next quarter."

"Did you fail the agility drills again?"

"I couldn't do the pull-ups."

Dad pressed his lips together and took a breath.  "I'm not sure you're giving it your best effort, Jamie."

"I am.  I really am.  I'm just not very good at sports."

"You get better with practice.  Like your brother Scott."

Jamie nodded, keeping his gaze down, hoping Dad didn't notice the way he gritted his teeth when he heard his older brother's name.

Dad clapped him on the shoulder.  "Jamie, you're twelve years old now.  It's really important that you find your best sport.  College recruiters are already contacting boys your age."

Jamie thought of his best friend Russell, who had just gotten his first recruiting letter the other day, from Penn State.  Jamie hung his head even lower.

"All I'm asking is that you try, son.  Will you do that for me?"

Jamie nodded again.

Dad folded up the grade printout and stuffed it into a pocket.  "Hey, I have an idea.  Why don't you sit in on the presentation tonight?"

"Oh, man."  Jamie looked up.  "Do I have to, Dad?"

"Why not?  Maybe you'll hear something you like."

A groan escaped Jamie.  He had homework to do for Advanced Literature--the next two chapters of _Dracula_, which he'd loved so far.  But experience had taught him not to proffer academic work as an excuse.  "Why don't you guys just order Scott's blood online?  That's what you usually do."

"The Nike representative wants to show us some new and improved stuff.  The bes</ns2:summary>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note- &lt;/strong&gt;most of these stories are picked automatically (via categories on the site) and so it&amp;#8217;s possible there may be a story in the For Kids feed, for example, that while not objectionable, may contain content that your kid won&amp;#8217;t be interested in. There&amp;#8217;s a difference between &amp;#8220;for kids&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;family friendly.&amp;#8221; Moving forward, the kid feed will contain &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8220;for kids&amp;#8221; stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title="Kid Friendly Feed" href="http://escapepod.org/category/podcasts/for-kids/feed" target="_blank"&gt;The For-Kids Feed&lt;/a&gt;- currently this includes nearly all G-rated stories especially geared for our younger listeners.&lt;/li&gt;

The kids may not be interested, but you can probably listen around them with minimal worry.&lt;/li&gt;

His previous Discworld novel, &amp;#8220;Unseen Academicals&amp;#8221;, was &#8211; to my mind, anyway &#8211; full of plots and ideas that Pratchett may have wanted to cover in future novels but was afraid he wouldn&amp;#8217;t be able to. I thought it made the book suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so much with &amp;#8220;I Shall Wear Midnight&amp;#8221;, the latest &#8211; and possibly the last, depending upon the progress of Pratchett&amp;#8217;s illness &#8211; Tiffany Aching novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Midnight&amp;#8221; begins when Tiffany is 16, and has taken on the mantle of the witch of the Chalk, a land in Discworld &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld_geography#Chalk"&gt;relatively close to Lancre&lt;/a&gt;. She does all the mucky jobs witches do &#8211; birthing babies, seeing to the sick, laying out the dead, and generally living and working near the edge. Early on, we are shown just how well Tiffany has learned her craft from Granny Weatherwax, &amp;#8220;the most highly regarded of the leaders [witches] didn&amp;#8217;t have&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;Wyrd Sisters&amp;#8221;) when she has to deal with Seth Petty, who has beaten his pregnant teenage daughter so severely that she lost the baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there we have the first insight that &amp;#8220;Midnight&amp;#8221;, while being a YA novel and shelved as such in many bookstores, is not for the immature. The thing is, after having read the book, that sequence is the most graphic and adult in the novel. To me it served a similar purpose to Shepherd Book&amp;#8217;s death in &amp;#8220;Serenity&amp;#8221; &#8211; a character will be killed off, to show how serious this is. There&amp;#8217;s a scene or two later in the book that reminds us, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t hold a candle to what Seth Petty did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we needed it, too, because the novel&amp;#8217;s main villain, the Cunning Man &#8211; the spirit of a long-dead priest of Omnianism, a religion established in &amp;#8220;Small Gods&amp;#8221; and referred to many times throughout the series &#8211; is somewhat hard to wrap one&amp;#8217;s head around. We&amp;#8217;re told he comes back every few hundred years, and he fights the witches, and the witches generally win. He came back this time because Tiffany kissed the Wintersmith (in the book of the same name) and drew enough attention to herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cunning Man is the kind of villain that works well for a YA audience because it makes people do things they normally wouldn&amp;#8217;t, against their will &#8211; similar to the hiver in &amp;#8220;A Hat Full of Sky&amp;#8221; &#8211; but it makes the book a little difficult to follow when it comes to the main plot. It&amp;#8217;s like &amp;#8220;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&amp;#8221;: Harry has the Dursleys, school, Quidditch, the Voldemort War, being in love with Ginny, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; he has to deal with the whole Voldemort thing&amp;#8230; but that last one gets lost in the shuffle amid all the other story arcs. The same with &amp;#8220;Midnight&amp;#8221; &#8211; Tiffany has to handle a lot of things in this book besides the Cunning Man, including caring for the people of the Chalk, the imminent marriage of her friend Roland (son of the Baron), the Duchess&amp;#8217;s treatment of her people, and Amber Petty (Seth&amp;#8217;s daughter), who seems to really like the Nac Mac Feegle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, yes. The Feegles are back &#8211; Rob Anybody, Jeannie the Kelda, and fan favorite, Daft Wullie. Rob even puts aside his Feegle nature for a moment when the Baron&amp;#8217;s men threaten their mound. It&amp;#8217;s quite a moment. And speaking of people who are back, one of the best parts of the book is when Tiffany meets Granny Weatherwax&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; successful apprentice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Midnight&amp;#8221; brings us all our favorite witches &#8211; Granny, Nanny, and even Magrat, along with mentions of Tiffany&amp;#8217;s friends Petulia and Anagramma, and her teacher Miss Tick &#8211; as well as introducing Mrs. Proust, who has a very surprising connection to Boffo (see &amp;#8220;Wintersmith&amp;#8221;). Tiffany also meets Captains Carrot and Angua (glad to see she&amp;#8217;s finally gotten that promotion), Constable Haddock, and the inimitable Commander Vimes. But the book takes place on the Chalk, for the most part, and despite the attendance of the senior witches &#8211; one of whom (and you can easily guess which) has fought the Cunning Man before &#8211; it&amp;#8217;s Tiffany who must save the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll be honest: I really didn&amp;#8217;t care for &amp;#8220;The Wee Free Men&amp;#8221;, but the rest of the Aching books have been good, solid stories, and if this one meandered a bit and did contain a tad too much additional plot (Miss Smith, the Duchess and Leticia, Tiffany Goes to Ankh-Morpork &#8211; which &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; felt shoehorned in there), Pratchett is still a good enough storyteller to tie it up neatly at the end. If &amp;#8220;I Shall Wear Midnight&amp;#8221; turns out to be the final Tiffany Aching novel, then I for one am satisfied with how her arc ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, that means we can get back to the business of making Vimes the next Patrician*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;* Oh, come on, you &lt;/em&gt;know&lt;em&gt; that&amp;#8217;s how the Discworld series will end.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.kyliechan.com/images/cover_thumbs/9780732282967.jpg" title="White Tiger" class="alignright" width="100" height="163" /&gt;Confession time: I don&amp;#8217;t finish books I don&amp;#8217;t like. I find it a waste of my time, and if I don&amp;#8217;t care to finish the book, I don&amp;#8217;t care to find out what happens at the end. *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sad truth is, I didn&amp;#8217;t finish &lt;em&gt;White Tiger&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hooked me, quite well in fact. I read 250 pages the first night. The pacing was good, the characters interesting. We have a headstrong English teacher, Emma, quitting her kindergarten teacher job in Hong Kong and immediately getting picked up as a live-in nanny for one of the girls she tutors. The single dad is smokin&amp;#8217; hot, the girl is delightful, and the pay is amazing. The conflict comes when she realizes he&amp;#8217;s a god and he can&amp;#8217;t return to his palace because he has to protect his daughter from demons who would kidnap her to control him, but staying away from his source of power is making him weaker and weaker. (There&amp;#8217;s a romance bit too, of course.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emma befriends the chauffeur/bodyguard, who is part information-dispenser and part tool to keep the character (and therefore the reader) in the dark. The character is a good one, don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong, but he and Emma begin pulling practical jokes on each other that just seem to come out of nowhere. He doesn&amp;#8217;t seem particularly playful, and every time they played a prank on each other, it pulled me out of the story because I started thinking, &amp;#8220;Why did that happen?&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the biggest flaw of this book was the lack of editing. It was far too long and needed tightening. Some dialogue was just unnecessary, some characters repeating &lt;em&gt;verbatim&lt;/em&gt; sentences they&amp;#8217;d said a paragraph earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can also see non-martial arts aficionados getting lost in the battle scenes, because Emma begins training with the god and Chan uses words that martial arts fans would know, but I&amp;#8217;m afraid others would not. And even though she went into detail about the training, she kept using only the term &amp;#8220;martial arts&amp;#8221; and never saying what system they were studying. (The fact that this was a Chinese god teaching her &amp;#8220;katas&amp;#8221; which are Japanese forms bugged the crap out of me. At least she didn&amp;#8217;t call him &amp;#8220;sensei&amp;#8221; which is also Japanese.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, &lt;em&gt;White Tiger&lt;/em&gt; had a good hook, a good premise, but suffered from bloat, and I just got bored with the repetition. If an editor had cut 100 pages, it probably would have held my interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* OK, there is one mystery I did wonder about. The name of the book is &lt;em&gt;White Tiger&lt;/em&gt;, and we meet a god who is the white tiger, but as far as I read, his role was tiny. I wondered where Chan was going to put him that would justify naming the whole book after him&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saint Darwin&#8217;s Spirituals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
By D.K. Thompson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ghosts wanted a threesome &#8211; the two of them in Lucy&#8217;s body. It wasn&#8217;t an unheard of proposition, or so Lucy had been told. Prostitutes considered psychic whoring one of the safest tricks on the streets. All the pleasures of intimacy without the messy clean-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghosts had a nasty reputation for vanishing the moment after, though, no matter the talisman around your neck or the potion drunk before sunset, and so payments were usually collected up front. Not that Lucy was worried about the money. Her husband was the only thing that concerned her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She adjusted her brass and leather goggles, peering through the ethereal tinted lenses to examine the ghosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They looked like the average apparitions. Both female. One spiraled around Lucy, long and curly hair obscuring her face. Large black blotches covered her body, causing her skin to peel off in patches. The other hovered several feet above the cobblestones in front of Lucy. She had a noose around her throat and her neck was bent so her head hung to the left side. She crossed her arms and took several breaths. Or whatever passed for breaths in the afterlife.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
How long had it been since they&#8217;d felt someone&#8217;s touch? &lt;/em&gt;Lucy wondered. She remembered something her husband had told her long ago, before the murders, before he&#8217;d disappeared. &#8220;Spirits linger in this world longing to be a part of it, to reconnect, to have some kind of physical, sensual experience,&#8221; Thomas had said. &#8220;Only a host can provide them that.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghosts aren&#8217;t the only creatures haunted by the memory of a touch, my love,&lt;/em&gt; Lucy thought. And yet, despite being a devout spiritualist, she shuddered at the idea of the cadaverous spirits making love inside her. She&#8217;d never had a ghostgasm before, much less been paid for one. The ghosts looked sincere in their desire, not like dangerous murderers. Certainly not monsters. Still, lonely as she was, a ghostgasm wouldn&#8217;t help her find Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://escapepod.org/2010/10/28/ep264-st-darwins-spirituals/"&gt;Read more&amp;#8230;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-1336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good idea, Rose,&#8221; said the ghost spinning around Lucy. The air trailing behind her churned like water in a boat&#8217;s wake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, love?&#8221; Rose asked, winding the noose&#8217;s end around her wrist. &#8220;She look a bit too practiced for your tastes, Ethel?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy felt her cheeks flush. She pulled her shawl over her shoulders and took several small breaths, all her tight corset allowed. &#8220;To be honest, I don&#8217;t service the dead.&#8221; It sounded so insulting, but she couldn&#8217;t tell them the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethel came to a halt an arm&#8217;s-length from Lucy&#8217;s face. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never heard of a whore who had much use for honesty.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A whore&#8217;s a whore,&#8221; said Rose. &#8220;We need a rental and our money&#8217;s honest, if nothing else is.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; Lucy said. &#8220;I meant no offense. But you should find someone else. I&#8217;m not quite ready for that kind of&#8230;spiritual&lt;br /&gt;
experience.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Ethel. &#8220;We&#8217;ll just have to find a more enlightened whore, then.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Lucy could respond, Ethel turned and shot down the street, passing through a carriage, and eliciting a curse from the coachman as his horses bucked and whinnied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You might as well have walked over her grave,&#8221; said Rose, fingers clenching the frayed rope. &#8220;Sorry we wasted your time.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; sorry,&#8221; Lucy sighed. &#8220;But I&#8217;m really not the one you want to make love to.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Too true. I don&#8217;t think she fancied the thought of using you, anyway,&#8221; said Rose. &#8220;Listen, you seem like a nice girl. Why don&#8217;t you look me up in Westminster some time? After you&#8217;re dead, of course.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ll consider it,&#8221; Lucy said politely, trying not to stare at the noose. &#8220;Although I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re my type.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Oh, you never know, love. Death can be very liberating,&#8221; Rose said with a wink. &#8220;But I&#8217;d rather you live a long life before becoming familiar with it. Best get off the streets. It&#8217;s getting late and it&#8217;s a nasty night. I don&#8217;t want to see you &#8216;round my area in the near future.&#8221; The ghost zoomed off in the direction Ethel had gone, the air shimmering behind her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy glanced down the dark, empty cobblestone streets. The carriage Ethel had flown through started moving again, clattering hooves echoing in the night air. She flipped out her pocket watch and eyed the time. Still early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one else propositioned Lucy for the next half-hour as she wandered Whitechapel, which suited her just fine. There were several prostitutes working, some stood alone under the hissing gas-lit street lamps, others talked with prospective clients, and one Lucy saw contorting on the alleyway floor in the thralls of a ghostgasm. Through the dark glass of her goggles, she could see the spirits twisting inside the prostitute, making love as the host writhed and moaned on the ground. The prostitute&#8217;s goggles magnified her blank stare. Had Ethel and Rose found an acceptable host?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy peeled off her goggles. Everything looked the same as it had before, except she could no longer see the ghosts, just the squirming prostitute who looked like she was having a seizure. Lucy quickened her pace, her footfalls drowning out the groans behind her. She rounded the corner and bumped into a golem deputy, its solid clay frame knocking her off balance. It glanced at her, yellow eyes dancing from the flames lit inside his mouth, then continued to trudge down the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the church bells struck midnight, Lucy sat on a bench, kicked off her shoes to rub her feet, and stared at the statue of Saint Charles Darwin in the center of the courtyard. His trademark invention, a pair of goggles, covered his eyes. He sat in his chair and seemed to look down at her, clutching his _Origin of the Species_ essay in one hand and his _Origin of the Spirits_ in the other, as if pondering their implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don&#8217;t look at me like that,&lt;/em&gt; she thought. &lt;em&gt;Sometimes I wish you hadn&#8217;t invented these damned things. Sometimes I feel so small and insignificant when I see through your lenses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bells finished ringing with a hollow sound. Lucy twisted her goggles in her hands and thought about how alone she was, how alone they all seemed to be. She wondered what had happened to Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It stayed quiet and dark for a long time. Finally, Lucy began toward home. She considered a different route to avoid the prostitute but decided her business must have surely concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No moans echoed from the same alley so Lucy glanced down it. She stopped at what she saw, rooted to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prostitute floated in the air, shuddering. The front of her emerald corset wet. The woman&#8217;s empty gaze stared past Lucy. Her goggles had shattered on the cobblestones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy tried to steady her breathing and pulled her goggles back on, looking for a sign of the ghost clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something flickered inside the prostitute&#8217;s body. Her eyes and nostrils and mouth seemed to glow. Transfixed, Lucy continued to stare. She&#8217;d never seen anything like this before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-pitched clattering filled the alley, like the blades of hundreds of knives screeching across metal plates. Then a pair of tentacles jutted through the woman&#8217;s chest, splitting it open and streaking her clothes with blood and gore and that same pale, flickering light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy staggered backwards, covered her mouth with her hands, and looked up. A dark shape hung above the prostitute, perched on a windowsill, wrapping its tentacles around the dead girl&#8217;s body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The monster,&lt;/em&gt; Lucy thought. &lt;em&gt;Jesus God, at last.&lt;/em&gt; She&#8217;d played this scene out over and over in her imagination since Thomas had disappeared. But watching it splatter blood and entrails across the alley, Lucy went cold. She took a deep breath, lifted her dress, and unstrapped the single-chamber pistol from her thigh. Swallowed. Tried to steady her trembling, sweating hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light pulsed inside the prostitute. Tentacles dug inside her. Then a sick, wet sound of something being pulped, and a shimmering form was yanked out. A woman. A moaning, eviscerated woman, clutching her wounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy caught her breath, said a prayer for the prostitute&#8217;s spirit, then fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the flare of the shot, the creature&#8217;s body was illuminated, a thorax, covered with hundreds of gleaming mouths. Not a rogue vampire, as the papers had speculated. At least not like any Lucy had seen. Then what the devil &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creature shrieked, so loud, Lucy almost dropped her pistol to cover her ears. The prostitute&#8217;s body fell headfirst to the ground, her skull cracking open across the pavement, dashing blood and bits of brain over Lucy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She took a step back and pulled another round from her pocket. The bullet slipped through her fingers and slid between the cobblestones. She reached for another. Slid it into the chamber and shoved it closed. Aimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monster had vanished into the night. Lucy panted and knelt beside the dead prostitute, looked for her spirit. Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She covered her face with her hands, panting and blinking back tears. She&#8217;d seen it. She&#8217;d come so close. And she&#8217;d let it escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bells sounded in the distance, higher-pitched than the church&#8217;s. The Paranormal Patrol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy wiped her palms on her dress, drying the sweat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patrol rounded the corner, bells ringing fast and loud. A pair of golems trotted beside the carriage, their dull gleaming eyes surveying the street. They hadn&#8217;t seen her, not yet. Lucy sprang to her feet and into the alley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shrill whistle sounded and heavy footsteps pounded behind her &#8211; the golems, picking up speed. The lenses of her goggles fogged. She pulled them down where they bounced against her neck as she ran, pistol clutched in hand. She wouldn&#8217;t kill a human constable, she&#8217;d rather turn herself in and face the consequences. But she had no qualms shooting a golem. They weren&#8217;t alive to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steam poured from ventilation shafts on the walls, blinding her. More than once, she glanced up at the rooftops, hoping to get a trace of the creature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A golem lurched out at her through the steam curtain, arms opened wide. She bounced off its chest and hit the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constable picked her up, its massive grey arms damp and sweating from the heat, and flung her against the brick wall. She landed in a puddle that smelled of piss and vomit, bits of clay sticking to her skin and clothes where the golem had touched her. Lucy rolled to her side, leveled her pistol at the golem and fired. Clay exploded around its chest and the golem flinched from the force of the shot, but its eyes maintained that yellow gleam as it lumbered toward her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She reached for another bullet. The golem stretched out its giant, wet hands toward her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s enough!&#8221; shouted someone above her. &#8220;Stand down, constable!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The golem froze. Lucy fell back against the wall, tugged her goggles back on to see a pair of spirits descend through the night air toward them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Police!&#8221; shouted one of the ghosts. &#8220;Stay where you are!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy caught her breath as Ethel and Rose descended beside her, feet hovering over the ground, both of them frowning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rose crossed her arms. &#8220;You again?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You two are police?&#8221; Lucy asked. &#8220;But you solicited me! You wanted to have sex with me!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Not with you, with each other,&#8221; Rose said. &#8220;You were just a warm body.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re paranormal officers,&#8221; Ethel explained. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been trying to find this monster before it killed again.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy blinked. She hadn&#8217;t heard of any police involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;And instead of it, we found you, assaulting an officer of the law,&#8221; said Rose. &#8220;Right after fleeing a murder scene. What&#8217;s a whore like you doing walking the streets this late with a pistol?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Working,&#8221; Lucy said. &#8220;It&#8217;s become something of a dangerous profession.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Come off it,&#8221; Rose said. &#8220;You&#8217;re no prostitute. What are you doing dressed like one? Don&#8217;t you realize something&#8217;s out there killing girls?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yes. Yes, I do.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What are you?&#8221; Ethel asked. &#8220;A nutter? A vigilante?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looked down at her clothes and the pistol in her hand, biting her lip. The ghosts and the golem continued to watch her, but she didn&#8217;t know how to answer them. What &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; she doing? Was she any closer to finding out what happened to Thomas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy closed her eyes, took a breath, then spoke through gritted teeth. &#8220;I&#8217;m a widow and a spiritualist. That&#8217;s all you need to know. Now, get out of my way.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that won&#8217;t do,&#8221; said Rose. &#8220;We&#8217;re short on time. If you won&#8217;t provide us with answers, we&#8217;ll have to find other ways of asking our questions.&#8221; And before Lucy could mutter any incantations or use a talisman against her, Rose dove into her body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy staggered, saw images from her past being splayed out and dissected in her mind&#8217;s eye, felt Rose&#8217;s thin, transparent fingers smudging her thoughts and memories, sifting through anything that looked significant to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas was there. Telling her about the reports he&#8217;d received: prostitutes whose deaths didn&#8217;t concern the police. He took the matter into his own hands, like a good spiritualist, hoping to learn about and document this new creature, hoping to save lives by understanding it. He started spending nights on the streets, armed with goggles, talismans, enchantments, and a pistol. He questioned prostitutes and their pimps, tried to figure out what was killing the girls and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy saw herself sitting in the kitchen, waiting for him to return. He&#8217;d walk in the door, dark circles sagging under his eyes, and talk for hours about the monster roaming the streets. How it stayed in the shadows, eviscerated its victims in a mess of blood and pulp, their ghosts never appearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was out every night in the company of prostitutes. They argued. So often, so long, and hard, they eventually stopped talking. Thomas went days between coming home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, after a week-long absence, Lucy realized he wasn&#8217;t coming home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rose trampled through it all, clouding Lucy&#8217;s memories. Every moment with Thomas, every argument they had, every time they made love. In that lifetime of seconds, Thomas seemed closer than ever, and yet Rose hovered above every instance, staring. Prying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy wanted to scream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They stood in the alley watching the prostitute&#8217;s ghostgasm (&lt;em&gt;Do I look like that now?&lt;/em&gt; Lucy wondered), saw her dead eyes as she floated. Tentacles tearing her open. Blood and gore. A gunshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Rose vanished, a cold emptiness filled Lucy, leaving her alone with memories that didn&#8217;t feel like her own anymore. Hollow and violated, a stranger in her own skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She opened her eyes and fell to the ground, gagging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethel was shouting about abuse and the law. Lucy pulled one of Thomas&#8217;s talismans from around her neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sweet Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,&#8221; Rose told Ethel. &#8220;She saw it. She saw the thing.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What?&#8221; Ethel asked, rounding on her, just as Lucy slammed her fist through Rose&#8217;s incorporeal body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rose shrieked in pain, flickering in and out of existence. She spun out of control into the night sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You bitch!&#8221; Lucy screamed. &#8220;You had no right! If you weren&#8217;t dead, I&#8217;d kill you myself!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethel phased against Lucy, slammed her back onto the ground. &#8220;Where&#8217;d you get a grounder?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ask your friend.&#8221; Lucy replied. &#8220;My husband was a spiritualist. He taught me a thing or two before that monster got him.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethel&#8217;s eyes widened. &#8220;Your husband? But that&#8217;s &#8211; that&#8217;s impossible. All the victims have been women.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Don&#8217;t argue with her, Ethel,&#8221; Rose said. She still flickered, although it came more sporadically. She narrowed her eyes at Lucy. &#8220;Not now. We need to get up to the roof. That&#8217;s where it disappeared to. We&#8217;ll deal with her later. The constable will watch her.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The golem stepped forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m going with you,&#8221; Lucy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No,&#8221; Ethel said. &#8220;You&#8217;ll only slow us down.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And without another word, the two ghosts shot upward, disappearing into the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy sighed, stuffed her hands into her pockets, and watched the golem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something cried out above them. Lucy glanced up, saw a spirit twisting in the air, entrails spilling out of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dead prostitute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A window shattered behind the spirit, punctured by a tentacle. The appendage pierced the ghost, hooked her like a fish on a line, and then reeled the screaming, writing spirit back into the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Do something!&#8221; Lucy shouted. The golem didn&#8217;t respond, just stared at her with a blank, flickering expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dammit!&#8221; Lucy shoved another round into the pistol&#8217;s chamber and fired point-black at the golem&#8217;s face. It stumbled backward, clay spraying the wall behind it. Without waiting to see if the fire went out of its mouth, Lucy turned and dashed into the building, reloading her pistol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halfway up the stairs, she found the creature in an empty, bedroom reeking of mildew and rotten meat, yellow paper peeling from the walls. It was a bloated, misshapen abomination sprouting claws and tentacles, covered by hundreds of cavernous mouths filled with teeth like straight razors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy staggered back, hiding behind the wall. &lt;em&gt;Hail Mary full of grace,&lt;/em&gt; she thought. &lt;em&gt;What is it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chattering sound echoed in the room. The mouths, Lucy realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tentacle burst through the wall, showering Lucy with cement shards and powdering her dress with pale dust. The tentacle coiled around Lucy&#8217;s waist, smashing her against the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It dragged her into the room. Lucy gripped her pistol, dragging her heels against the floorboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My name&#8217;s Lucy Stone. You&#8217;re acquainted with my husband,&#8221; she said, the practiced speech coming easy despite her terror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creature paused at her voice. Hissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I will be your undoing.&#8221; Lucy pushed her pistol against the tentacle that held her and fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creature roared, dropping her. Black phlegm spurted from the wounded tentacle. It whipped through the air, smashing her to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other tentacles lashed out in a blur, knocking the pistol off the stairs, coiling around Lucy&#8217;s neck. Her skin burned where it touched her. In the distance, she heard a thumping sound. &lt;em&gt;Just my pulse,&lt;/em&gt; she thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It slammed her back into the hallway, against the banister. Wood splintered and cut into her back. She kicked again, managed to look down. Saw the ground several stories below. The creature pulled her close to its thorax and its many mouths opened, flashing jagged white teeth. Thin, serpentine tongues flicked out of each mouth, like miniature tentacles. Foul breath filled the air, stinking of blood and decay. Lucy felt the tongues&#8217; bristles touch her, stinging. It was smelling her through those bristles. Somehow, she knew that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Why did you take Thomas?&#8221; She couldn&#8217;t bring herself to ask if he was still alive. Rose&#8217;s invasion of her body and memories had brought everything back to the surface, swimming just before her eyes. &#8220;Goddamn you, why?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mouths grinned back at her, their teeth dripping with saliva and blood. Moans and growls bellowed from the monster. Voices echoed inside Lucy&#8217;s head, growing louder instead of fading. So loud she screamed. Some of the voices matched the mouths. They weren&#8217;t united; instead they drowned each other out, hollow whispers filling her thoughts. Then one of the voices surfaced above the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Thomas?&#8221; it hissed, the voice wet and fleshy. For a moment, the mouths kept moving but went silent. The laughter spilled from several, until the rest joined in, mocking her in chorus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy gasped, pulling at the tentacle. The pounding rhythm in her ears grew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You are alone.&#8221; The tentacle tightened around Lucy&#8217;s neck. &#8220;Thomas was alone, too.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It flung her against the wall. She fell, rolling down the wooden stairs. Cracked her forehead on a step, a trickle of warm blood blurring her vision. But she was alive. It hadn&#8217;t killed her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why?&lt;/em&gt; She gritted her teeth. &lt;em&gt;Why hadn&#8217;t it killed her?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thumping grew louder, closer. The whole staircase shuddered. Lucy wiped the blood from her eyes as the golem constable turned the corner, thudding up the steps, gaping holes in its chest and head. The monster lashed at the constable with its tentacles. The golem brushed them off with ease and leapt at the creature. Together, golem and monster fell into the stairwell&#8217;s void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy scrambled to her feet and looked over the ledge. She couldn&#8217;t see the creature but the golem had crashed onto the floor, its soft clay skin misshapen. It didn&#8217;t move, although its yellow eyes stared up at her with that dull gaze. Then they dimmed, flickering out, and Lucy huddled against the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alone, it had said. And it had been right. She was certainly alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Someone must&#8217;ve been watching out for you, Mrs. Stone,&#8221; Ethel said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two ghosts had flown over Whitechapel&#8217;s rooftops searching for the beast, they&#8217;d explained. Eventually, they found the trail of thick, dark blood leading back to the building and Lucy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Do you think so?&#8221; Lucy asked. She stood on the clay speckled tile floor. Goggled constables bustled in and out the door. The building residents stood on the stairwell, discussing what they&#8217;d seen. &#8220;I wonder why he wasn&#8217;t watching out for the other poor girls as well, then? Or your constable?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Christ,&#8221; muttered Rose. &#8220;Are you one of those fashionable Darwin-slandering cultists, trying to deny spirituality?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Of course not. I can&#8217;t deny it&#8217;s there,&#8221; she said and tapped her goggles. &#8220;But sometimes when I&#8217;m tired, I take off my goggles. And I can&#8217;t see. And that&#8217;s when I think I&#8217;m able to believe the most: when I&#8217;m almost able to deny it.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s rational,&#8221; Rose said, twisting her crooked neck. &#8220;That why you believe your husband&#8217;s dead? Because you never saw the body?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What?&#8221; Lucy asked. &#8220;You saw what happened. That thing killed my husband.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see any such thing,&#8221; Rose said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mrs. Stone,&#8221; Ethel said. &#8220;Have you considered that maybe your husband isn&#8217;t dead? He spent a significant amount of time in the company of prostitutes. It&#8217;s possible he&#8217;s still alive.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No, he wouldn&#8217;t do that,&#8221; Lucy said. &#8220;We argued a lot before he left, but he loved me. He wouldn&#8217;t just leave. He must be dead.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;And that&#8217;s why you&#8217;ll help us?&#8221; Rose asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What are you suggesting?&#8221; Ethel demanded. &#8220;That we endanger the life of an innocent, of a civilian?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need a host to catch this thing,&#8221; Rose said. &#8220;You know that. There&#8217;s no other way. She wants to help. I say let her.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A host?&#8221; asked Lucy. &#8220;Why?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lucy, we&#8217;ve been on the streets looking for this thing, or for a spirit it&#8217;s disembodied. We&#8217;ve never found one. In fact you&#8217;re the first thing, living or dead, that&#8217;s been able to tell us what it looks like.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;But how can that be? I&#8217;ve studied Darwin,&#8221; Lucy said. &#8220;A person leaves some kind of imprint on this world when they die, even if they end up moving on to the next plane of existence.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Ethel said. &#8220;But what about ghosts? Do they leave anything behind?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ghosts can&#8217;t die,&#8221; Lucy replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t linger forever, either,&#8221; said Ethel. &#8220;Some choose to pass onto whatever&#8217;s next as soon as they become disembodied. Others stay until everything we&#8217;ve known and loved fades away. But when we move on is a choice we make.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You saw what happened to that poor ghost,&#8221; said Rose. When the monster said you were alone, it was talking about spirits inside of you. You only had your own. Whatever this thing is, it&#8217;s only killing prostitutes having ghostgasms. It&#8217;s killing _ghosts_.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So you want to use me?&#8221; Lucy asked. &#8220;You want to come inside me and make me bait?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Out of the question,&#8221; Ethel said. &#8220;Absolutely not.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You were already trying to bait it earlier,&#8221; Rose said. &#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, you even shot it.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s why you tried to solicit me tonight, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Lucy asked. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t want sex, you were trying to catch that thing.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Not exactly. A little companionship is always welcome,&#8221; Rose said, pulling the slack out of the noose around her neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s enough, Rose,&#8221; Ethel said. Lucy thought if Ethel had been flesh and blood, she would&#8217;ve blushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So what do you say, Lucy?&#8221; Rose asked. &#8220;Can we have sex with you, for queen and country?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What will it feel like?&#8221; Lucy asked them the following night. She&#8217;d met Ethel and Rose only several blocks from where she&#8217;d found the dead prostitute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, do I?&#8221; Rose said. &#8220;Never experienced it from your end.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethel peeled a flap of her skin back and forth. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you a spiritualist?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy didn&#8217;t reply. She&#8217;d been married to Thomas since she was seventeen and the idea of sharing that part of herself with someone else, physical or spiritual, made her feel unfaithful. She&#8217;d spent hours of the day researching what Darwin had written about the experience in preparation of the deed. An out-of-body experience was how the saint had described it. Looking at Ethel and Rose&#8217;s decrepit forms, the idea struck her as less than romantic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lucy,&#8221; said Ethel, &#8220;You should know ghosts lose control when they&#8217;re inside a host. We&#8217;ll try and be mindful but we&#8217;ll need you to be on the lookout, too.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy thought of the ghostgasm she&#8217;d witnessed, how the host looked like she&#8217;d had less control of her body than the ghosts. &#8220;I understand.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Are you ready?&#8221; Ethel asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy nodded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Enough wasting time, then,&#8221; said Rose. And with that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two ghosts flew into her body, exploding inside her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St. Darwin had been right: it _was_ like an out-of-body experience. She glided over her own body and saw Rose and Ethel moving inside her, against one another, clutching each other close. And yet she could feel every touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wet kisses peppered her neck, sending a shock down her spine. A tongue filled her mouth and hands cupped her breasts while another pair traced her hips, pulling her tight. Fingers slid between her legs, tender, exploring inside her. Lucy&#8217;s breath quickened as she felt the growing warmth there. Whoever had told her this wasn&#8217;t messy hadn&#8217;t been completely honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She closed her eyes, tried to imagine Thomas. It worked for a little while. She felt it all happening to her, even though she was no longer inside her. Then she saw herself alone, twitching on the ground, her back arching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She tried to swallow back tears, tasted their salty warmth as the joy spilled over her, rushing between her legs, throbbing. From her strange perspective, Lucy watched her own body glow as the ghosts moaned and cried out. She cried with them, saw the tears streaking her own face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Thomas,&#8221; she sobbed. &#8220;Thomas.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the distance, bells began to ring. Everything went cold. Lucy looked up and saw it slithering forward, toward them. Its mouths open and tentacles stretching out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s here!&#8221; cried Lucy. &#8220;Ethel! Rose!&#8221; She felt the ghosts disentangling themselves, trying to exit her body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Police! We&#8217;ve got golems surrounding you!&#8221; Ethel shouted. &#8220;Lucy? Lucy what are you doing!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Lucy ignored her and swooped toward the monster. She dodged the tentacles and spikes whipping about, and dove inside the beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the opposite of having Ethel and Rose in her. All the bliss fled, replaced by a humid, sticky sensation. She wasn&#8217;t alone. Spirits surrounded her, their forms as destroyed as the physical victims. Lucy felt their hands grab at her dress, her hair, pulling her down further into darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Thomas!&#8221; she cried, trying to free herself. &#8220;Where are you?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the spirits gripped Lucy. Her insides hung out, squishing against Lucy. The prostitute. &#8220;Help me!&#8221; she wailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy yanked her arm away. &#8220;Thomas! Thomas, where are you?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An arm wrapped around Lucy&#8217;s neck, pulled her up. &#8220;What the hell are you doing?&#8221; Rose shouted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can&#8217;t find Thomas!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s not here. He was _never_ here!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He has to be!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Thomas?&#8221; The eviscerated spirit floated close to them but this time didn&#8217;t touch her. &#8220;Spiritualist? It &#8211; it didn&#8217;t kill him.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deeper sense of dread filled Lucy. &#8220;How do you know?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something cold and wet dripped on Lucy before the ghost could answer. She looked up and saw Rose&#8217;s spirit melting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lucy!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Go,&#8221; the prostitute said. &#8220;Hurry!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around her, the faces and spirits closed in. The other spirits&#8217; screams built in her mind the way the voices had on the stairwell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rose pulled once more. This time, Lucy let her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She sat up, gagging, the scent of stale sex clinging to her clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The golem deputies had pinned the creature&#8217;s tentacles down, securing its body. One of the tentacles had impaled something shimmering. As the glow faded, Lucy realized what it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ethel?&#8221; she coughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ghost twisted on the tentacle, chunks of her missing. The monster&#8217;s many mouths opened and closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rose flashed beside the monster, prying at its thorax as the golems held it. It twitched and turned, going through its own ghostgasm. Then a howl broke out from all the mouths, and the creature split open. A blinding light washed out the dark street. The ghosts fluttered into the air, shimmering in all their dead glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She watched each of them fly out of the monster&#8217;s body, praying Thomas would appear, even though something inside her knew he would not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rose descended beside Ethel&#8217;s flickering, tried to cradle what was left of her lover in her arms, but instead slid right through her. She wailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy stumbled toward them. &#8220;Rose?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ghost said nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What happened? How&#8217;d we get out when the others were trapped?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Maybe because it didn&#8217;t kill us, because we invaded it. I didn&#8217;t think much of it, I was following you.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethel flickered one last time, and then disappeared. The monster&#8217;s tentacle stopped twitching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; Lucy said. &#8220;You&#8217;re already dead.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You saw what almost happened when you used the grounder on me.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What did almost happen?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rose shook her head. &#8220;The beginning? The end? I don&#8217;t know. You&#8217;re the spiritualist.&#8221; Then Rose looked up, stared past her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy looked behind her, saw the spirit of the dead prostitute hovering there, trying to cover up the way her insides were spilling out. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have long,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Moving on, I guess. You freed us, so I thought you should know.&#8221; The prostitute shook her head. &#8220;My pimp reckoned the spiritualist should&#8217;ve paid for his research. Didn&#8217;t realize he was trying to help us girls.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Do you know where he is?&#8221; Lucy asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s dead,&#8221; the spirit said. &#8220;Stabbed.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What?&#8221; Lucy said, blinking back tears. &#8220;Where is he? Where&#8217;s his spirit?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that. Only his body. It&#8217;s in the cellar of a public house off Berners Street. I&#8217;m very sorry,&#8221; she said. Then the spirit faded until there was nothing left but wisps of steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy staggered back, sobbing. Behind her, the golems pulled at the creature&#8217;s empty husk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ll send a patrol,&#8221; Rose said. &#8220;See what there is to see.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy nodded, trying to choke back the tears. Then she pulled off her goggles and shut her eyes. Rose vanished but suddenly, Lucy felt as though she could sense Thomas&#8217;s invisible spirit hovering just beyond her reach, lingering close beside her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She did not feel alone.&lt;/p&gt;

Saint Darwinrsquo;s Spirituals
By D.K. Thompson

The ghosts wanted a threesome ndash; the two of them in Lucyrsquo;s body. It wasnrsquo;t an unheard of proposition, or so Lucy had been told. Prostitutes considered psychic whoring one of the safest tricks on the streets. All the pleasures of intimacy without the messy clean-up.

Ghosts had a nasty reputation for vanishing the moment after, though, no matter the talisman around your neck or the potion drunk before sunset, and so payments were usually collected up front. Not that Lucy was worried about the money. Her husband was the only thing that concerned her.

She adjusted her brass and leather goggles, peering through the ethereal tinted lenses to examine the ghosts.

They looked like the average apparitions. Both female. One spiraled around Lucy, long and curly hair obscuring her face. Large black blotches covered her body, causing her skin to peel off in patches. The other hovered several feet above the cobblestones in front of Lucy. She had a noose around her throat and her neck was bent so her head hung to the left side. She crossed her arms and took several breaths. Or whatever passed for breaths in the afterlife.

How long had it been since theyrsquo;d felt someonersquo;s touch? Lucy wondered. She remembered something her husband had told her long ago, before the murders, before hersquo;d disappeared. ldquo;Spirits linger in this world longing to be a part of it, to reconnect, to have some kind of physical, sensual experience,rdquo; Thomas had said. ldquo;Only a host can provide them that.rdquo;

Ghosts arenrsquo;t the only creatures haunted by the memory of a touch, my love, Lucy thought. And yet, despite being a devout spiritualist, she shuddered at the idea of the cadaverous spirits making love inside her. Shersquo;d never had a ghostgasm before, much less been paid for one. The ghosts looked sincere in their desire, not like dangerous murderers. Certainly not monsters. Still, lonely as she was, a ghostgasm wouldnrsquo;t help her find Thomas.

ldquo;I donrsquo;t think itrsquo;s a good idea, Rose,rdquo; said the ghost spinning around Lucy. The air trailing behind her churned like water in a boatrsquo;s wake.

ldquo;Whatrsquo;s the matter, love?rdquo; Rose asked, winding the noosersquo;s end around her wrist. ldquo;She look a bit too practiced for your tastes, Ethel?rdquo;

Lucy felt her cheeks flush. She pulled her shawl over her shoulders and took several small breaths, all her tight corset allowed. ldquo;To be honest, I donrsquo;t service the dead.rdquo; It sounded so insulting, but she couldnrsquo;t tell them the truth.

Ethel came to a halt an armrsquo;s-length from Lucyrsquo;s face. ldquo;Irsquo;ve never heard of a whore who had much use for honesty.rdquo;

ldquo;A whorersquo;s a whore,rdquo; said Rose. ldquo;We need a rental and our moneyrsquo;s honest, if nothing else is.rdquo;

ldquo;Irsquo;m sorry,rdquo; Lucy said. ldquo;I meant no offense. But you should find someone else. Irsquo;m not quite ready for that kind ofhellip;spiritual
experience.rdquo;

ldquo;Well,rdquo; said Ethel. ldquo;Wersquo;ll just have to find a more e...</ns2:summary>

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a writer and consumer of genre fiction, now should be the perfect time of year for me, right? After all, Halloween is just around the corner&lt;a href="#jr_halloween_1"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; [Ed note: Mur was very bad in getting this up, so consider Halloween having just passed us by...] &lt;/em&gt;and every sci-fi blog, podcast, and show is extolling the virtues of Halloween.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, though, Halloween&amp;#8230; just doesn&amp;#8217;t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, maybe when my daughter is a little older and she starts going door-to-door asking for donations of unhealthy food&lt;a href="#jr_halloween_2"&gt;**&lt;/a&gt; while wearing an amusing costume, I might care a little more. I might also care more if more trick-or-treaters came to my door, but I think we get an average of five per year. I&amp;#8217;ve taken to putting out a bowl and being done with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halloween holds no special place in my heart. Which is weird, because I write some pretty dark, disturbing fiction when the mood strikes. But I don&amp;#8217;t care about costumes, decorations, scary movies being more relevant now than in February or June, candy (except Nerds Rope, which is awesome), or parties. I don&amp;#8217;t dress up (I might wear a funny wig to work), I don&amp;#8217;t gorge myself on sweets, I don&amp;#8217;t watch &lt;i&gt;The Ring&lt;/i&gt; or listen to a reading of &amp;#8220;The Cask of Amontillado&amp;#8221;. This year I&amp;#8217;ll probably be asleep before the trick-or-treaters even arrive because I have to be at work before 6am the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s not just being old and crotchety. I&amp;#8217;ve never crocheted in my life. In college, I didn&amp;#8217;t make it a point to go to Halloween parties. When I was a kid, I trick-or-treated, but I wasn&amp;#8217;t one of those who kept it up as a teenager. I stopped dressing up at about age 11, and that was that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#8217;t see the point of making such a big deal out of a holiday that you don&amp;#8217;t even get off of work or school. Maybe that makes me weird, or an outcast in the community, but I can&amp;#8217;t be the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; genre person who doesn&amp;#8217;t care that October 31 is supposed to mean candy, costumes, parties, and scary media &amp;#8212; I think we were all really sick of &lt;i&gt;ER&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#8216;s Halloween episodes after a couple of seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, sadly, Halloween exists to sell stuff, and so the media can trot out their &amp;#8220;razor blade in the candy&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;check over your kid&amp;#8217;s trick-or-treat bag&amp;#8221; stories that they&amp;#8217;ve been brushing off for the past few decades. Good space fillers. Good ways to sell things people don&amp;#8217;t really need to eat. Good for kids (unless their parents object to the holiday, which kind of makes &amp;#8220;write your favorite Halloween memory in your writing journal today&amp;#8221; assignments pretty hard).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sorry. I don&amp;#8217;t get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go and have your fun this Halloween. Enjoy your movies, and your candy, and your parties, and dressing up like Sexy Elmo, or Sexy Avatar Blue Person, or Sexy Chilean Miner&amp;#8217;s Wife, or just your average angel or devil. Spend your money, consume your media, enjoy the hell out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll be sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="jr_halloween_1"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Or, at least, it was when I wrote this. I&amp;#8217;ve been woefully delinquent lately.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="jr_halloween_2"&gt;**&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Come to think of it, most canned food collected in food drives is absurdly high in sodium, which isn&amp;#8217;t good for you either.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Are Ted Tuscadero For President&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
By Chris Dahlen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Ted Tuscadero. And I want to be your President.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say that with a humble heart. I realize that even after eight stellar years in the Senate, some of you are still getting to know me. And I&#8217;ll admit, I am not perfect. The other day, when I told a VFW in Littleton I would blast Iran to glass, and at the same exact time I swore off the war at a town hall in Concord? My bad. Or the time that three of me showed up for the big debate in Manchester, and we got in a fistfight over who was going on the air? Yeah, the chattering classes had a few laughs over that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that little incident before the holidays, when I crashed, as lit as a Christmas tree, into a pole and my car exploded, killing me instantly and taking a mailbox, a transformer and a barn cat with me? It looked bad, I know. But that proxy was on the fritz. That&#8217;s not me. That&#8217;s not who I am. And the more we talk, the better you get to know me, the more you&#8217;ll see what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://escapepod.org/2010/11/04/ep-265-we-are-ted-tuscadero-for-president"&gt;Keep reading&amp;#8230;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-1388"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a lucky man. Of the hundred of me that fanned out across New Hampshire for the presidential primary campaign, I landed in Fairport, a cute spot on the coast. My ex-wife would&#8217;ve called it &#8220;darling.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t even know New Hampshire &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; a coast until they drove me here and got me a room, looking over the harbor, the tugboats, the cobblestone streets. The whole place is loaded with money and photo ops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to think it&#8217;s payback for a job well done. For the last six months I&#8217;ve been shaking hands, holding town halls, and listening to cranky seniors and eager young back-to-the-earthers. I&#8217;ve eaten food on a stick that belonged in the trash. I&#8217;ve honed my laugh lines and I&#8217;ve sold my vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary&#8217;s in January, and my opponent, Billy LaMontagne, has local roots. Three-time governor of neighboring Maine, well known and well liked in the area, LaMontagne doesn&#8217;t use proxies: he&#8217;s stumping the state all by himself. But he doesn&#8217;t need proxies when everyone with four teeth or fewer knows his face and thinks they can trust it. I&amp;#8217;m the insurgent from New Jersey with everything to prove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s what the focus groups say about me: &#8220;City slicker.&#8221; &#8220;Promises anything to anyone.&#8221; &#8220;Will take away our right to bear arms.&#8221; That one really gets me &amp;#8211; LaMontagne likes to wave around an assault rifle during deer season to show all the yokels that he likes red meat and Milwaukee&#8217;s worst as much as the rest of them. And fine, next to that, I do look slick. It&#8217;s called &#8220;owning a comb and a necktie,&#8221; and I&#8217;ve been doing it since Princeton, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LaMontagne can crack the screen, I&#8217;ll grant him that. When this is all over, he should really get his own line of barbeque sauce. But we&#8217;re talking about a national election. The guy has a loose mouth and a small mind and if he gets the nomination, the Republicans won&#8217;t even run against him: they&#8217;ll kick back and watch him destroy himself. So, this race isn&#8217;t just about me. It&#8217;s my duty as a loyal Democrat to put this guy down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to me. I have two jobs here in Fairport. First and foremost is the usual campaign stuff &amp;#8211; shake a lot of hands, get a lot of money. But I also have a project. I was explaining it to an eighth-grader the other day. She was doing a thing for her school paper &amp;#8211; which has a teeny readership made up of a totally non-voting audience, but hey, any press is good, and I never talk above an eighth-grade level anyway. We sat in the school gym, with old crumbly murals and the outlines of kids painted on the wall, all kind of round and blank &amp;#8211; probably just the same kid painted over and over.&#160; Above it all flew a giant American flag, and I made sure it was in the shot when she took my picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So, um, Senator Tuscadero -&#8221; starts the kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Call me Ted,&#8221; I say, flashing my brilliant white teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Um, I&#8217;m not sure how to ask this, but &amp;#8211; are you the real Senator Tuscadero, or -&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m a proxy,&#8221; I say, smiling again. I never let anyone feel awkward, especially about this. &#8220;I&#8217;m one of the hundred proxies in New Hampshire, here for the original Ted Tuscadero, who&#8217;s down in D.C. doing the work of the people. The proxies are here to give the people of New Hampshire -&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first-in-the-nation primary voters, who can set me up with that sweet, sweet early momentum&lt;/em&gt;, I&#8217;m thinking -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220; &amp;#8211; A close look at my governing style, my experience, and my vision for a better America.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So you&#8217;re called a &amp;#8216;proxy.&amp;#8217; Do you ever call yourselves &amp;#8216;clones&amp;#8217;?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I laugh again gently. &#8220;We could, but we prefer the term &amp;#8216;proxy.&amp;#8217;&#8221;&#160; (&amp;#8220;Clone&amp;#8221; tested badly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we get to why I&#8217;m in Fairport: my special project, which will show the voters what a doer and a leader I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So Amy, I&#8217;d like to tell you what I&#8217;m here to do. You may have heard that Fairport would like to build a windmill. A state-of-the-art, clean green energy solution that would cut your bills and make us safe from the bad guys across the sea.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy nods her head up and down and cocks it to the side, like she&#8217;d seen somebody do on TV. Maybe Couric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s on Parakeet Ave,&#8221; she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exactly. That&#8217;s the site they chose. And the trouble is, someone else &amp;#8211; a man named Jim McSmit &amp;#8211; bought the land, and he&#8217;d like to put a different business there.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A bar?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s right. A bar.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s what the eighth-grader can&#8217;t put in her newspaper: the &amp;#8220;restaurant and bar&amp;#8221; would be called Body Shots. It&#8217;s a biker-themed titty bar, dropped right here on the snooty seacoast. The neighbors for a mile around are batshit about this, about how it&#8217;ll look, who it&#8217;ll draw, the growl of barely-ridden Harleys in the parking lot. But the zoning doesn&#8217;t prohibit it. Somebody needs to work out a deal. And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m here to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My campaign aide, Rachael, subtly taps her watch. Time to wrap this up. I answer a couple more questions and shook my little reporter&#8217;s hand. We also give her some pins and a pamphlet for her parents. &#8220;TOM TUSCADERO: A &lt;em&gt;REAL&lt;/em&gt; LEADER FOR AMERICA.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget to vote!&#8221; I wink at her as they whisk me out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;m here with two aides. One is my driver &amp;#8211; after the Christmas crash, we all got drivers &amp;#8211; and the other is Rachael, my aide. Also my lover. And by &#8220;lover,&#8221; I mean, &lt;em&gt;&#8221;yeeeeeeeee-haw.&#8221;&lt;/em&gt; She has a dual degree in poli-sci and psychology, though I&#8217;ll be frank, that&#8217;s not the first thing I noticed when they assigned her to me. A slender brunette just out of Swarthmore, she&amp;#8217;s an idealist who still believes in the process. She loves politics. She&#8217;s smitten with me, too, and she&#8217;s also kind of fascinated by me. She&#8217;s drawn to my meteoric career &amp;#8211; but also, to my complex personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What have we got today?&#8221; I ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The senior citizens&amp;#8217; center at 10, lunch with the chamber of commerce at noon, and dialing-for-dollars in the afternoon.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wince. I hate dialing for dollars. I call everyone I&#8217;ve known my whole life and ask them for money. It feels crass, plus, sometimes our lists get mixed up. I&#8217;ll end up calling my third-grade English teacher and just as I&#8217;m about to reminisce, she tells me that another proxy already rang her up with the same &#8220;you walked me to the school nurse&#8221; memory. It always makes me feel like a phony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before all that, we head downtown. I swing by Main Street at least once a day. Grab a latte from the locally owned caf&#233; dead center downtown. The same apple Danish: fatty I know, but it&#8217;s comfort food and oh boy, the way they bake &amp;#8216;em it&#8217;s like an angel crying on your tongue. And then I swing by and spar with the guys at the barbershop. I can always count on five or six voters waiting for a cut. This barber is slower than death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe the barber hates me. He&#8217;s a Republican from way back. He probably cast his first vote for Lincoln. Every time I set foot in his shop he greets me the same way: &#8220;You cost too goddamn much.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hi Joe,&#8221; I say, smiling and winking at his peanut gallery. &#8220;What&#8217;s the good news today?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The radio says they want to make more of you, for the general election,&#8221; says Joe. &#8220;It&#8217;s a waste of taxpayer dollars. We have too many politicians crawling around the country as it is.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Well, Joe, as you know, making more proxies is cheap money after the first one.&#8221; This is true. When they perfected the cloning process, they found an interesting trick: cloning one person costs &#8230; well, it&#8217;s a state secret how much it costs, so you can guess how much that is. But the first time you do it, you make a kind of a &#8220;mold&#8221; &amp;#8211; that&#8217;s how they explained it to me, anyway &amp;#8211; and from that mold, you can pour as many copies as you want for a few bucks a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m a bargain, Joe. You get to tell me off in person every day!&#8221; I wink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take a quick glance to see how the other men react. But I notice that most of them are looking out the window at Rachael, who&#8217;s standing outside on her phone. It&#8217;s freezing, but she always waits outside at the barbershop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little more chitchat, one more winning smile and I&#8217;m moving on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;m starting to think I know this town better than the one where I live. I know where to get the best martini and the freshest lobster roll. I can practically count the votes here by name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You know what, Rach? When I&#8217;m done with the White House, we should come back here. I would make a really good Mayor.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;First things first, Senator,&#8221; she says, and steers me back to the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the hotel, I get out of the shower to see Rachael tapping at her laptop. She snaps it closed as soon as she hears me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bad news in the polls?&#8221; I ask, smiling &amp;#8211; not my politician smile, but my real one. Only Rachael gets the real one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yes, but not in yours. I was actually reading about the Republicans. Word is, Governor Kewt just got himself a sex scandal.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hot damn! Was he caught with a dead girl? A live boy? &lt;em&gt;Both&lt;/em&gt;?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Daughter of a senator &amp;#8211; scratch that, &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; daughters &amp;#8211; and they let it slip on Twitter. They get a book deal, he&#8217;s down for the count.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s it! The Republicans are done! Kewt&amp;#8217;s the only candidate they had this year who could walk down the street without wearing out his knuckles. I feel relief and desire and &lt;em&gt;lust&lt;/em&gt;. I have this thing in the &lt;em&gt;bag&lt;/em&gt;. I can picture myself &#8230; well, um, &lt;em&gt;yeah&lt;/em&gt;, myself &#8230; walking into the Oval Office and dropping my loafers right on the top of that desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She responds to my smile. She loves this game, almost as much as I do. I know what you&#8217;re probably thinking: I picked her as my aide because &lt;em&gt;va-vooom&lt;/em&gt;. But believe me, I&#8217;m lucky to have her. She&#8217;s been working on campaigns since junior high. This is her first real gig on a national campaign, and she already acts like a vet. I would be lost without her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&#8217;d be lost on nights like this, too. Back in Washington I was out every night and on the phone the minute I got home. I&#8217;d call old friends, new colleagues, people I had to cajole, constituents who thought I&#8217;d never remember their names. I loved to talk to people. But now that I&#8217;m &#8230; well, I can&#8217;t really do that now. None of us proxies are allowed to make casual calls, and these aren&#8217;t &#8220;my&#8221; friends anymore. It would creep people out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Rachael? Rachael is all mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have to get up in five hours,&#8221; she says, pulling me into bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So let&#8217;s get three hours of sleep.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you&#8217;re lucky I&#8217;ll make it one.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I&#8217;m tired and not in the mood the next morning when my phone rings. It was someone I didn&#8217;t want to talk to, and I had to schlep all the way outside to meet him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pull on some clothes and go to the street to find Harry Angler idling at the curb, in a rental car, his window halfway down. A doughy guy with a potato-shaped head and a comb-over like bent hay, he had, as always, no facial expression whatsoever. And here he is, getting &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; up first thing in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angler&#8217;s the guy who gets stuff done for me in D.C. When I first found him, early in my career, he was just a two-bit election-fixer working for dead-end campaigns. You know the racket &amp;#8211; running push polls to make the other guy sound like Hitler&#8217;s lost grandson, or spreading photos of an uptight Christian blitzed at a gay bar. Angler didn&#8217;t have much of a resume. But I saw something there I could use, and now he works for me &#8211; I mean, the original me, the me in D.C. &amp;#8211; on all of my campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That also means he&#8217;s in charge of the proxies. He swings by to check in on me every couple of weeks. I used to have him on the phone twenty times a day, and now I only get time with him when he feels like showing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Harry, hi,&#8221; I say, leaning casually on the window. He just pushes a poll in my hand. &#8220;This is confidential from the campaign.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I skim the pages. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see any surprises.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;LaMontagne&amp;#8217;s gaining ground with 50-65 year old divorcees. You have a lot of those here, no?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could you at least turn off the car so I don&#8217;t have to talk over your engine?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Oh sure, I&#8217;m working their votes,&#8221; I say. &#8220;And listen, I also made some headway on the windmill project -&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s good. We have no room for error here. And don&#8217;t forget, Windswept Industries needs that thing built, or the money they&#8217;re sending us is gone.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chitchat a little more, but I can tell he&#8217;s eager to move on. &lt;em&gt;Dammit&lt;/em&gt;, I think, &lt;em&gt;would you treat me &amp;#8211; the original me &amp;#8211; this way? How would me-in-D.C. act if he saw you act like this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But again, I didn&#8217;t say anything. Because hard as it is to admit, I need him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounding casual, I ask: &#8220;Listen, so, any movement on the leaderboard?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The leaderboard&amp;#8217;s always moving,&#8221; he answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So how am I doing?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;ve done great work here,&#8221; says Angler. &#8220;Great work. And we expect even more.&#8221; And that&#8217;s all I get out of him before he leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Can I ask you a question?&#8221; says Joe the barber, a straight razor over my temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Shoot,&#8221; I say. I was there, for once, to get an actual haircut, and we had the shop to ourselves. Seeing Angler&#8217;s scruffy dome made me want to get my own cleaned up. Have to look my best for all those lonely old women whose votes weren&#8217;t in the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re Ted Tuscadero, and there&#8217;s Senator Ted Tuscadero down in Washington. And then there are ninety-nine more of you running around.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s the headcount.&#8221; Well, it&#8217;s a hundred minus the one we lost on Christmas. And I think Rachael said another one just &#8220;dropped out.&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure what that means-I was eavesdropping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So when this election&#8217;s over, what do you all do?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Well, during the election as you know, I&#8217;ll be traveling the country for the campaign. After that? We&#8217;ll still represent the President, and push his agenda. You remember when people joked that President Obama was -everywhere- whenever he had something to push. I can really do it.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So you stay on the road, while the first Senator goes to the White House?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I shouldn&#8217;t tell him. But I can&#8217;t resist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Here&#8217;s the thing,&#8221; I say, lowering my tone. &#8220;We have something called the -leaderboard.- It&#8217;s how we rank all the proxies.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe is shaving me now, getting things oh-so-smooth around my ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The way it works, when you help the campaign, you move up. If you screw up, you move down. The proxies near the top get the choice assignments. And when the election&#8217;s over, the top one gets &amp;#8211; well, I shouldn&#8217;t say.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Let me guess. You get some time in the White House?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; I answer. &#8220;The original Ted can take long vacations while I stay in Washington. I get to share power with myself.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe thinks it over, but he doesn&#8217;t seem convinced. &#8220;I dunno. He&#8217;s you. You&#8217;re him. Would you give up the top seat? For even one single day?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He catches me for a second. But I shoot him an easy smile and say, &#8220;Well, I do like my vacations.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe laughs. Score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I know you think you&#8217;re doing us voters a favor. But the thing is, people don&#8217;t like politicians,&#8221; says Joe. &#8220;We only like &amp;#8216;em at their funerals.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I care about the windmill. And I care about this town. You see me every day!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ted, if you lived here, I&#8217;d hate you year-round!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Maybe you just don&#8217;t know me well enough,&#8221; I grin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my way out the door, my cell phone rings. I have to take this call: it&#8217;s none other than Jim McSmit, the guy whose nudie bar stands between me and the White House. He suggests we meet for lunch. Rachael had been working for days to set this up, and now he calls me, and names the restaurant. It&#8217;s not the one I would&#8217;ve picked &amp;#8211; but only because I&#8217;m not a member. Yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McSmit meets me at the 10 Congress Club. It&#8217;s a swank new social club, with a membership fee in the thousands and a line of old and new money waiting to pay. McSmit, shall we say, is &#8220;new money.&#8221; One look at the guy and you hid your wallet. Beady eyes squinted between a smooth-shaved dome and a bushy handlebar moustache, and his leather jacket was filthy. First thing he warned me: &#8220;Don&#8217;t swear in here. They&#8217;ll fucking fine you.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal here was to see if we could settle this at a cost the city council could swallow. And it wasn&#8217;t starting well. We started off on his turf, on his clock, and he knew that he had what I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Here&#8217;s my thing,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I&#8217;m just a guy making a living on beer, tits and wings. Not a Washington big shot like you.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hey, I think I know a little more about your situation than you&#8217;d think,&#8221; I correct him. &#8220;I ran a small business myself.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yeah? What was that?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My law practice.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McSmit scoffs, at that but I ignore him. &#8220;I was a trial lawyer. Win a case, and you&#8217;re rich; lose, and you just wasted a year on nothing. I know what American businessmen put on the line.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What I&#8217;ve heard, you won plenty of cases. Did pretty well for yourself. Why&#8217;d you even get into politics? What do they pay you in the Senate?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not really about the pay,&#8221; I say, realizing no one ever really asks me about this. &#8220;I love it for the same reason I love a trial. I love going into a court and &lt;em&gt;persuading&lt;/em&gt; people &amp;#8211; because that&#8217;s half the battle, not just having the facts and the evidence, but convincing them you&#8217;re their guy. I&#8217;m good at that. Put me in front of anyone, face to face, and I can get them to hear me out. And when they do, they usually agree with me.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McSmit cuts me off. &#8220;Don&#8217;t count on getting any agreement from me. Seems you just came here to tell me to get out of town. And nobody tells me that. Ever.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tough talk. But I&#8217;ve heard tougher.&#160; &#8220;Okay. Then what &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; I tell you?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What&#8217;ll you give me if I nix the restaurant?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I laugh. &#8220;I&#8217;m not writing you a check, if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re getting at. Election officials take offense at that kind of thing.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not fucking slow, I know you can&#8217;t just -give- me something. But even if you lose the race, you&#8217;re a fucking Senator. A favor from you could be worth something. And anyway, LaMontagne&amp;#8217;s people have been dragging their dicks in the sand about what &lt;em&gt;they&amp;#8217;ll&lt;/em&gt; do for me.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This surprises me. &#8220;You&#8217;re saying LaMontagne&amp;#8217;s backing you up on this?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Well, yeah, I talk to some of his people. He doesn&#8217;t talk to me directly, like you. There aren&#8217;t as many of him, so his time&#8217;s worth a lot more.&#8221; His grin went halfway to a snarl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;LaMontagne will never make it to the White House. If I win here, I win the White House. And I will remember the people who helped me along the way.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McSmit goes silent. He swirls his drink around. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s fucking sweet, but what can you do for me down there? LaMontagne&amp;#8217;s right over in Maine. Lots of girls in Maine want to work for a Body Shots, &#8216;specially in this economy. Lots of local talent up there. You know they have a topless donut shop up near the capital?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So I guess you&#8217;re saying you don&#8217;t want me to go to Washington and save the economy,&#8221; I joke. That gets a genuine laugh out of him, and for a second there, I don&#8217;t want to kill the guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by the time the tab comes, I know we&#8217;re done here. And he hammers it in as he reaches for the tab and looks at the fines that the maitre d- was quietly ticking up every time he opened his stupid mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sorry I can&#8217;t help you. But hey, I&#8217;m the one who spent $240 to tell you what&#8217;s on my mind.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What&#8217;s plan B?&#8221; Rachael asks back at the hotel, where I don&#8217;t even feel like sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sigh. &#8220;We can try to seize the lot through eminent domain, but that&#8217;s a scorched earth approach. It&#8217;s bound to tick off voters left, right, and center.&#8221; I groan. &#8220;Maybe I can find another buyer for the land.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;But LaMontagne will find a way to block you,&#8221; she says. And that stings. Here&#8217;s LaMontagne, playing his pawns against me while he won&#8217;t even stoop to sit at the chessboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When I get into office, I&#8217;m going to move so much nuclear waste to his state that that fucker won&#8217;t need lights on the highway.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I love it when you talk all tough,&#8221; Rachael laughs. She walks into the other room to pour a couple of drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her laptop is open, and I glance over and see a poll on her screen. I&#8217;ve never seen this one before. It isn&#8217;t a poll of the primary, or the likely nominees. It isn&#8217;t an issues poll, either. It&#8217;s a poll I&#8217;ve never seen before &amp;#8211; a poll about proxies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Do you support the use of proxies to reach out to voters?&#8221; asked the first question. 63% said yes. Okay, that&#8217;s nice. The voters still like the personal touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Recently, the federal government revealed the true price of the program. Do you think it&#8217;s worth the expense?&#8221; Hey, that was news &amp;#8211; I didn&#8217;t realize the cost had leaked. Doesn&#8217;t anyone know how to keep a state secret anymore? And here, the numbers look bad: 3% thought it was worth the money, 2% were not sure. Everyone else was totally pissed off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, okay, people hate it when you spend their money. But come on, we can spin this. I just catch the next question, which looked like it had something to do with my car crash last December. &#8220;Given the controversy over the cost, the ethical issues, and the public safety risks, do you believe the proxy program should-&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I hear Rachael padding back into the bedroom. Skilled from years of surfing porn at the office, I flick the window back in time and slide away from the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; she asks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Planning my next move on the Body Shots situation.&#8221; With a heavy sigh I say, &#8220;This is going to get ugly. Rach, I&#8217;m going to need to talk to Harry Angler tomorrow. Can you get me on the phone with him?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minute the name leaves my lips, I know I&#8217;ve screwed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, Rachael&#8217;s an idealist. A world saver. She used to spend spring break walking girls past the mobs at abortion clinics. She hears me bring up Angler&#8217;s name, and she know exactly what I have in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You don&#8217;t have any other ideas?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nope. None. I can&#8217;t do this the right way. But I can still get it done.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her eyes get hard &amp;#8211; she&#8217;s giving me idealist eyes. &#8220;You know I joined this campaign because I know you can be a good man. That&#8217;s what matters to me. You&#8217;re here to do right, and this isn&#8217;t right.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rachael, sometimes the ends justify the -&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She cuts that off with a wave of her hand. &#8220;Don&#8217;t bullshit me.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I speak to her as honestly as I know how. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a choice here, Rach. I really don&#8217;t have a choice. If I slip on the leaderboard, if I don&#8217;t deliver this town &amp;#8211; I&#8217;m finished. Just finished. You think I don&#8217;t know have my own questions about how this thing works? Do you think I really believe that the bottom ten guys are getting ambassadorships?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;And,&#8221; I added after a thought, &#8220;Regardless. I didn&#8217;t come this far to give up. That&#8217;s not who I am.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&#8217;t talk the rest of that night. The last time I see her is when she drops my blanket and pillow on the couch. But I can handle that. Give it time, and she&#8217;ll see my point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next week was very convenient for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McSmit made the papers: while driving back from a meeting to look at plans for an ice luge, McSmit started driving erratically. He totaled his Mustang on the lawn of a historic house, pulverizing a 17th century birdbath. And what should the cops find in the glove compartment but a tiny bag with a few snorts of cocaine. The legal bill will be staggering. Selling the lot for Body Shots is a given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time of the primary, we had a deal. The Council voted for it; the windmill company gave them a special price for a pilot program. Even Rachael started to warm back up to me. She isn&#8217;t happy about McSmit &amp;#8211; no mistaking that &amp;#8211; but hey, green energy is one of her issues. Technically, this is a win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won the primary, too. The state was close, but I had a landslide margin in Fairport. And I made the top of the proxy leaderboard. I should&#8217;ve been over the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But somehow I don&#8217;t feel finished with this place. In fact, to tell the truth? It feels like the town is finished with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On primary night, I stood outside the polling place at the middle school, shaking hands at the gym. On the way in, everyone shook my hand and promised to give me their vote. And on the way out, they kept saying goodbye &amp;#8211; like they were never going to see me again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My campaign party felt like a wake. At the Mayor came, and he gave me a beefy handshake. &#8220;Ted, we&#8217;re really pleased about this project,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And hey, I know you&#8217;ll be busy in the White House next spring. But is there any way you could come back for the groundbreaking? It&#8217;s your baby, and we&#8217;d love to take your photo with it.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t miss it,&#8221; I say, smiling. &#8220;But listen. In case I&#8217;m busy. Could we take the photo with -&#8221; I didn&#8217;t know how to put this. &#8220;Like, could you take a picture of me for this?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ted, we haven&#8217;t even broken ground yet -&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I blurt it out. &#8220;If I come back this fall, well &amp;#8211; I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;ll be me. &lt;em&gt;Me&lt;/em&gt; me. You know?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mayor suddenly got my meaning. He stopped, and we had an awkward moment. But it was just a moment. He&#8217;s a pol, and he knows how to come right back to the comfort zone. With a cough and a smile, he claps me on the back and says, &#8220;Ted? It&#8217;ll be you and me and the Secret Service and all your friends in Fairport. And we will welcome you back.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last day in Fairport, I decide to get my hair cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally I go to Joe&#8217;s. I wanted to say goodbye, and rib him a little for not voting for me. Rachael said she&#8217;d meet me here as soon as the cars packed, and then we&#8217;re off to D.C. for our next assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ted, I didn&#8217;t vote for you, that&#8217;s true. You&#8217;re on the wrong ticket,&#8221; says Joe. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve gotta say, you lived up to your word. You said you&#8217;d build that ridiculous windmill and saddle us all with debt, and you did it.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;ll save money in the long run,&#8221; I remind him as he changed clippers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Remains to be seen.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ll come back and find out,&#8221; I smile. Damn was I feeling home sick already, and we hadn&#8217;t even pulled out of town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe is silent for a while. &#8220;So, what&#8217;s next for you?&#8221; he asks, and he sounds a little funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They haven&#8217;t told me. But I have a feeling it&#8217;s gonna be great,&#8221; I say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I&#8217;m curious what&#8217;s next. Just because the election&#8217;s in the bag doesn&#8217;t mean we can stop working. Maybe they&#8217;ll send me to California &#8211; the big prize. I love the weather. And one of me isn&#8217;t enough for a state that big. Maybe I&#8217;ll get more proxies, working under me &#8211; a hundred of them canvassing the state, and I would coordinate them all. In fact, I wonder if I can give each of them a Rachael.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look out the window to see if Rachael&#8217;s brought the car. And then I spot something: a van pulls up outside, and a man in a rumbled trench coat slouches out. It&#8217;s Angler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What&#8217;s in the paper,&#8221; I ask, &#8220;any good news?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nah. Nothing you should worry about. You just won big, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angler walks in, and I get a feeling in my gut &amp;#8211; the feeling I get when I&#8217;m about to be ambushed by a reporter, or sunk in a debate, or just when I shouldn&#8217;t take a call. I get a feeling that I should excuse myself. But there&#8217;s nowhere to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Senator,&#8221; he says, &#8220;come with me.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wait a minute. His haircut&#8217;s not done,&#8221; Joe objects. He puts a hand on my shoulder. Angler doesn&#8217;t even look at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Time to go, Senator.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nod to Joe and stand. I offer to pay, but Joe shakes his head. &#8220;On the house.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Well, thanks Joe. I really appreciate that.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for the first time, he extends his hand. We shake. &#8220;Best of luck to you, Senator,&#8221; he says. And as I leave the shop and get in the van, I feel good. I could swear I almost have his vote.&lt;/p&gt;

We Are Ted Tuscadero For President
By Chris Dahlen

My name is Ted Tuscadero. And I want to be your President.

I say that with a humble heart. I realize that even after eight stellar years in the Senate, some of you are still getting to know me. And Irsquo;ll admit, I am not perfect. The other day, when I told a VFW in Littleton I would blast Iran to glass, and at the same exact time I swore off the war at a town hall in Concord? My bad. Or the time that three of me showed up for the big debate in Manchester, and we got in a fistfight over who was going on the air? Yeah, the chattering classes had a few laughs over that one.

And that little incident before the holidays, when I crashed, as lit as a Christmas tree, into a pole and my car exploded, killing me instantly and taking a mailbox, a transformer and a barn cat with me? It looked bad, I know. But that proxy was on the fritz. Thatrsquo;s not me. Thatrsquo;s not who I am. And the more we talk, the better you get to know me, the more yoursquo;ll see what I mean.

Keep reading...


#

I am a lucky man. Of the hundred of me that fanned out across New Hampshire for the presidential primary campaign, I landed in Fairport, a cute spot on the coast. My ex-wife wouldrsquo;ve called it ldquo;darling.rdquo; I didnrsquo;t even know New Hampshire had a coast until they drove me here and got me a room, looking over the harbor, the tugboats, the cobblestone streets. The whole place is loaded with money and photo ops.

I like to think itrsquo;s payback for a job well done. For the last six months Irsquo;ve been shaking hands, holding town halls, and listening to cranky seniors and eager young back-to-the-earthers. Irsquo;ve eaten food on a stick that belonged in the trash. Irsquo;ve honed my laugh lines and Irsquo;ve sold my vision.

The primaryrsquo;s in January, and my opponent, Billy LaMontagne, has local roots. Three-time governor of neighboring Maine, well known and well liked in the area, LaMontagne doesnrsquo;t use proxies: hersquo;s stumping the state all by himself. But he doesnrsquo;t need proxies when everyone with four teeth or fewer knows his face and thinks they can trust it. I'm the insurgent from New Jersey with everything to prove.

Here's what the focus groups say about me: ldquo;City slicker.rdquo; ldquo;Promises anything to anyone.rdquo; ldquo;Will take away our right to bear arms.rdquo; That one really gets me - LaMontagne likes to wave around an assault rifle during deer season to show all the yokels that he likes red meat and Milwaukeersquo;s worst as much as the rest of them. And fine, next to that, I do look slick. Itrsquo;s called ldquo;owning a comb and a necktie,rdquo; and Irsquo;ve been doing it since Princeton, thanks.

LaMontagne can crack the screen, Irsquo;ll grant him that. When this is all over, he should really get his own line of barbeque sauce. But wersquo;re talking about a national election. The guy has a loose mouth and a small mind and if he gets the nomination, the Republicans wonrsquo;t even run against him: theyrsquo;ll kick back and watch him destroy himself. So, this race isnrsquo;t just about me. Itrsquo;s my duty as a loyal Democrat to put this guy down.

But back to me. I have two jobs here in Fairport. First and foremost is the usual campaign stuff - shake a lot of hands, get a lot of money. But I also have a project. I was explaining it to an eighth-grader the other day. She was doing a thing for her school paper - which has a teeny readership made up of a totally no...</ns2:summary>

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Y&#8217;know, Halloween has always felt like the perfect time for storytelling. Whether it is ghost stories by the campfire, or Hammer horror from the comfort of your own living room (my personal preference), its just the perfectly obvious season for the supernatural and scarifying. While it has ever been thus for people like you and me, it seems to be catching on in the mainstream too. AMC&#8217;s zombie TV series &lt;a href="http://www.amctv.com/originals/The-Walking-Dead/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, based on the Eisner award-winning &lt;a href="http://www.hiddenrobot.com/WALKINGDEAD/" target="_blank"&gt;comic book series from Image&lt;/a&gt;, premiered to their biggest debut audience ever at 5.3 million viewers. Seasonal television is an American staple (perhaps less so here in the UK), with even series like the surreal college sitcom &lt;a href="http://www.nbc.com/community/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Community&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; playing &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology_(Community)" target="_blank"&gt;quite brilliantly&lt;/a&gt; with the zombie genre just a couple of days before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halloween also saw the launch of a new, free online podcast magazine and website, showcasing the best in genre short fiction. &lt;a href="http://www.darkfictionmagazine.co.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Fiction Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the brainchild of &lt;strong&gt;Sharon Ring&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Del Lakin-Smith&lt;/strong&gt;, two names familiar to the UK genre scene. Their stated aim is to produce a monthly short fiction podcast magazine, featuring at least four short stories in each issue focussed around a distinct theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of &#8216;a rising tide lifts all boats&#8217; (thanks for that, Mur!), we spoke to Sharon and Del about their new project and what people can expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/DFMScreenshot1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1403" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/DFMScreenshot1.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="368" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Escape Pod: Thanks for joining us! Let&#8217;s start with yourselves &#8211; wh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;at are your respective backgrounds, and what gave you the idea of starting &lt;em&gt;Dark Fiction Magazine&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Del&lt;/strong&gt;: I have been working in IT for over 15 years in one form or another and have either run or helped out on numerous websites, so I have my feet firmly in the cloud, so to speak. I&#8217;m also obsessed with music, audio engineering and genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I launched a podcast in February of last year called &lt;a href="http://www.wordpunk.co.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WordPunk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which covers all sorts of geeky stuff like tech, genre, movies, etc. I had been looking for ways to expand it or cross pollinate with other non-audio based blogs. Sharon ran the idea of &lt;em&gt;Dark Fiction Magazine&lt;/em&gt; by me and I was hooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharon&lt;/strong&gt;: I got into book blogging a couple of years ago with&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="http://darkfictionreview.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Dark Fiction Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. From there I moved into working as a freelance editor, mostly on horror novels and short stories. &lt;em&gt;Dark Fiction Magazine&lt;/em&gt; was an idea I&#8217;d had rattling around my head all summer. Turned out, talking to Del, he&#8217;d been thinking along the same lines. And that was it: the coolest partnership in podcasting history was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made you want to make &lt;em&gt;Dark Fiction Magazine&lt;/em&gt; a podcast instead of a regular, text-based website?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podcasts have been around since late 1998, but it was not until 2005 that Apple included native support in iTunes, increasing their popularity massively. These days most people will listen to a podcast in some form, be that a BBC iPlayer &lt;em&gt;Listen Again&lt;/em&gt;, an audio book or an internet radio station. So to us, this is the perfect growth medium to launch a short fiction site on. There are many text based short story magazines, and a few audio based ones too, but we saw an opportunity in the market to bring a curated monthly magazine offering high quality genre audio fiction to the masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you see &lt;em&gt;Dark Fiction Magazine&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fitting into current landscape of podcasts and free audio fiction? Hugo-winners aside, the UK seems to be lagging a little in the area, with podcasting still dominated by US shows. In particular, free audio fiction in podcast form has been produced Stateside for a long while now &#8211; &lt;em&gt;Escape Pod&lt;/em&gt; being just one example!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very good question. Both in fandom and publishing, it is a very close knit community. And there are many passionate, selfless people all working together (and apart) to strengthen the community and industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we looked at the current market, we felt that we could add value to the guys and gals already bringing fantastic audio fiction to us. We are UK-centric, certainly, more from circumstance than deliberation, which lets us offer something different and focus more on our audience. We still see ourselves as a global service bringing out stories from authors all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liberating thing about being a free service is that the rules of competition and engagement are different. We are not stealing customers from others, as there are more than enough to go round and our service is similar enough to others that any new listener we get is also a potential listener for them. So we are trying to strike that difficult balance of differentiation enough to be intriguing, but not too much where we have nothing to compare ourselves to and align with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your mid- and long-term goals for &lt;em&gt;Dark Fiction Magazine&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest we have been blown away by the positive responses we have had since launch and we are really pleased with how it is going. As for plans going forward, we aim to keep growing our range of stories, authors, narrators and artists while creating a valuable medium for new talent to launch themselves from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also keen to partner with disability charities to ensure their customers get the best access to our free audio stories as possible and we are playing with the idea of expanding the platform into more cutting edge digital experiments. We are all about accessibility, so if there is a way to get great fiction out there, we hope to embrace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, who exactly is &lt;em&gt;Dark Fiction Magazine&lt;/em&gt; aimed at? As well as current fiction, will there&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; be readings of old classics? And are you open to submissions or contributions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Fiction Magazine&lt;/em&gt; is for absolutely everyone who loves genre fiction. We&#8217;re not tied to one genre or sub-genre, so we&#8217;re able to podcast lots of content with broad appeal. Our target audience is anyone and everyone. We hope to get sci-fi readers tuning in to horror episodes; fantasy readers listening in to sci-fi. Too often people stick within their own little reading and listening niches. We&#8217;re after a wider audience than that. Good genre fiction knows no boundaries, and neither does &lt;em&gt;Dark Fiction Magazine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#8217;re interested in submissions from new and established writers but we would ask people to check out our submissions policy first to see whether their material is eligible for submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be some classic stories read in time. You&#8217;ll have to keep an ear out for future episodes to see which of your own favourites make an appearance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Del and Sharon, thank-you very much!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.darkfictionmagazine.co.uk/episode/episode1/" target="_blank"&gt;Issue 1&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Dark Fiction Magazine&lt;/em&gt; is available now, and features stories by Gary McMahon, Sarah Pinborough, Joseph D&#8217;Lacey, and Conrad Williams. Authors lined up for future issues include Pat Cadigan, Cory Doctorow, Jon Courtenay, Grimwood, Ramsey Campbell, Rob Shearman, Kim Lakin-Smith, Ian Whates, Lauren Beukes, Mark Morris, Adam Nevill, Gareth L Powell, Jeremy C Shipp, and Jennifer Williams, among others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Fiction Magazine&lt;/em&gt; can also be subscribed to &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/id400265614" target="_blank"&gt;on iTunes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Dark Fiction Magazine&lt;/em&gt; and its founders are all on Twitter as &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/darkficmagazine" target="_blank"&gt;@darkficmagazine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/dfreview" target="_blank"&gt;@dfreview&lt;/a&gt; (Sharon), and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/dellakin_smith" target="_blank"&gt;@dellakin_smith&lt;/a&gt; (Del).&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>Like many writers, I&amp;#8217;m not very good at making time to write. My days are, well, packed. I&amp;#8217;m up at 5:15 to go to the gym, on the road at 7:20 to commute to work, at my desk by 8:30, back on the road between 5:30 and 6:00, home by 6:45 if I&amp;#8217;m lucky, having [...]</description>
			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Like many writers, I&amp;#8217;m not very good at making time to write. My days are, well, packed. I&amp;#8217;m up at 5:15 to go to the gym, on the road at 7:20 to commute to work, at my desk by 8:30, back on the road between 5:30 and 6:00, home by 6:45 if I&amp;#8217;m lucky, having dinner and spending time with the kid, then after she goes to bed I have to pack my stuff for the next day, make lunches, and am lucky to have half an hour to myself before going up to bed between 9:15 and 9:30. There I read for 15 minutes to unwind my brain, and then lights out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s amazing that I manage to write &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;, given that crazy schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine said that if I love writing, I shouldn&amp;#8217;t give it up to exercise, but if you&amp;#8217;ve seen me, you know I need it. I accept that. It&amp;#8217;s why I joined the gym in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do write. A little, here and there. Sometimes at work, sometimes in the evenings, sometimes on the weekends (which are consumed by family time for the most part). I remember reading somewhere that David Mack, when he started out, would write for a few hours at night, giving up sleep in favor of writing&lt;a href="#jr_nano1"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;. I tried that too. The thing is, I&amp;#8217;m not one of those people who can just sit down and start writing, especially if I&amp;#8217;m in the middle of a story. I need to be in the zone &amp;#8212; reread a little bit, get back into the characters, remember what I wanted to do next, and then actually be able to do the writing (and have enough time to do it, like people who write on their lunch breaks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I telling you all this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I&amp;#8217;m jealous. I&amp;#8217;m extremely jealous, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/"&gt;NaNoWriMo&lt;/a&gt; is this month, and I&amp;#8217;m not doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m jealous of people who have the commitment and the drive and above all else the ability to make time to write 50,000 words in a month. Which isn&amp;#8217;t to say I &lt;em&gt;can&amp;#8217;t&lt;/em&gt; do it &amp;#8212; I wrote a 17,000-word novella in a couple of weeks, back in early 2009. But right now isn&amp;#8217;t my time. Nor was last year. Or the year before that. Or the year before that. And so on. I accept that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But do you follow any writers on Twitter? Because if you follow folks like &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/nobilis"&gt;Nobilis&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/voidmunashii"&gt;Void Munashii&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/inkhaven"&gt;Inkhaven&lt;/a&gt;, or your favorite fanfic writer (a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of them do it), you&amp;#8217;re seeing word counts, status updates, messages of joy as your writer friends reach milestones&amp;#8230; and the bad stuff too: &amp;#8220;I didn&amp;#8217;t write today.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;My plot isn&amp;#8217;t working out.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;This story sucks, but I have to finish it.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;I lost all my saved files.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like my writer friends, don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong, but reading their progress reports just makes me sad. As a writer without the time or the ability to make said time, all I can do is look on and occasionally offer congratulatory or sympathetic messages. And I can tell myself, &amp;#8220;maybe next year.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been telling myself that for five years now. Might as well keep up the tradition in 2011, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, your reward for reading my self-indulgent whining: a music video for &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhs-yodZJcw"&gt;&amp;#8220;The Nanowrimo Song&amp;#8221; by All Caps.&lt;/a&gt; Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="jr_nano1"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;This may be apocryphal&lt;a href="#jr_nano2"&gt;**&lt;/a&gt;, but I&amp;#8217;m sure Mack isn&amp;#8217;t the only writer to ever do this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="jr_nano2"&gt;**&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;As Mack noted in the comments, this is indeed true. I should&amp;#8217;ve said I might be misremembering &amp;#8212; totally my bad on the incorrect use of &amp;#8220;apocryphal&amp;#8221;. Sorry about that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignright" title="Gregor the overlander" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/95/The_Underland_Chronicles_-_Gregor_the_Overlander.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="318" /&gt;I am the mom of an eight-year-old, so I do keep up with the kids&amp;#8217; book market, but I chose these books because they were written by the Queen of Pacing, Suzanne Collins, author of the huge hit, &lt;em&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/em&gt; trilogy. (Which I loved, despite the disappointment of &lt;em&gt;Mockingjay&lt;/em&gt;, but that&amp;#8217;s another blog post.) When I found that she&amp;#8217;d written five midgrade novels, I got them via &lt;a href="http://www.emusic.com" target="_blank"&gt;eMusic&lt;/a&gt;. (not an affiliate link, I do love eMusic for their catalog and their non-DRM files.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is where I&amp;#8217;m firmly believing that tropes and clich&#233;s don&amp;#8217;t kill stories; bad writing kills stories. If I told you the basic plot- boy in our world falls into mysterious magical underground kingdom were he&amp;#8217;s prophesied to save them all, you&amp;#8217;d snort and say, &amp;#8220;oh, &lt;em&gt;that&amp;#8217;s&lt;/em&gt; original.&amp;#8221; But so what? Original or not, Collins makes it awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregor is eleven, and a pretty responsible kid, since his grandmother has dementia and his mom takes care of him, his seven year old sister Lizzie, and his two year old sister Boots. His dad disappeared over two years ago, and he&amp;#8217;s had to take on a lot of the childcare (and elder care) since his mom works to support the five of them. He falls into the Underland, where they immediately treat him like a dirty stranger (they keep insisting he bathe) and he inadvertently offends them frequently. Then we find out about the prophesy, and the giant rats, and a quest, and it&amp;#8217;s a whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes Collins&amp;#8217; work shine is, of course, her pacing, which keeps me sitting in the car long after I&amp;#8217;ve gotten home to get to the end of a chapter. But her characters are also awesome. Gregor should show a little more fear as an eleven year old- he admits to a fear of heights, but we never see this fear manifest- but he&amp;#8217;s a solid kid who&amp;#8217;s smart but impulsive. The surprise is how well his two year old sister fits into the story. Boots is charming and fun and has a weird ability to tell the giant cockroaches (&amp;#8220;crawlers&amp;#8221; is the polite term) apart, something the Underlanders can&amp;#8217;t even do. When she has a tantrum in the first book, it&amp;#8217;s perfectly suited to the situation, and even comes in handy as they&amp;#8217;re captured by some creatures who don&amp;#8217;t like loud noises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it seems a little too easy traveling with a two year old (I seem to remember my two year old not being so ready to accept a brand new schedule, never mind constant adventure), and the descriptions in the underland sometimes seem too clear to allow for the amount of light they had available, but those are minor complaints to an otherwise fun read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prophesies, other lands, and heroic outsiders are common tropes in fantasy, but give them to a talented writer, and you will still have a book you can&amp;#8217;t put down. I&amp;#8217;ve finished the first two, &lt;em&gt;Gregor the Overlander &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Prophesy of Bane&lt;/em&gt;, and I&amp;#8217;m eager to get the other three. Highly recommended for any mid-grade reader (or adult) who loves adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Since this is an audio podcast, I should mention the audiobook is a great listen, the narrator giving life to the characters. The consistency isn&amp;#8217;t the same through the books, though, which is irritating. A major rat character sounds bored and sardonic in book 1 and scratchy and mean in book 2&amp;#8230;.)&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>If I only read e-books, I'd never have stopped at the B&amp;#38;N discount rack on my recent vacation and picked up &lt;i&gt;A Princess of Mars&lt;/i&gt;. There's a reason it's a classic.</description>
			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of the things I&amp;#8217;m going to miss terribly when e-books are the norm and brick-and-mortar stores are few and far between will be the opportunity to walk into a bookstore, pick up the one thing I really want to read, and then hit the discount rack on the way to the checkout. That&amp;#8217;s exactly what I did when I was in Florida recently, picking up &lt;a href="http://escapepod.org/2010/10/22/book-review-i-shall-wear-midnight-by-terry-pratchett/"&gt;I Shall Wear Midnight&lt;/a&gt;, which I later reviewed on this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the books I picked up on my way out of the store was a three-pack of &lt;em&gt;John Carter of Mars&lt;/em&gt; novels, by Edgar Rice Burroughs. I&amp;#8217;d heard there might be a movie coming soon, and I wanted to familiarize myself with a sci-fi classic that I probably should&amp;#8217;ve read long ago anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;#8217;ve finished &lt;em&gt;A Princess of Mars&lt;/em&gt;, I can sort of see why they&amp;#8217;re classics. &lt;em&gt;Sort of.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many novels written in the late 19th/early 20th century, &lt;em&gt;A Princess of Mars&lt;/em&gt; starts out with the discovery of a manuscript by the author himself, and his memories of &amp;#8220;Uncle Jack&amp;#8221;. Burroughs uses the device effectively to set up the mythology of John Carter, and then jumps into the story. The first act is fairly straightforward: Carter goes to Mars, discovers he&amp;#8217;s stronger than most everyone there, and manages to impress the natives. Burroughs spends a lot of time describing this new world, and though most readers of current fiction would say &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tldr"&gt;tl;dr&lt;/a&gt; or bemoan the author&amp;#8217;s use of infodumps, that was the style back then, so I give it a pass. At the end of that act, he meets Dejah Thoris, the eponymous Princess of Mars, and decides he&amp;#8217;s fallen in love with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this point in the novel, I&amp;#8217;d hit on its major sticking point &amp;#8212; at least, in my mind &amp;#8212; and it&amp;#8217;s something I&amp;#8217;ve seen in other fiction of the era: John Carter&amp;#8230; well, he&amp;#8217;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, he&amp;#8217;s not awesome. He&amp;#8217;s AWESOME. There&amp;#8217;s literally nothing John Carter cannot do on Mars: he has superior strength, agility, martial prowess, physical attractiveness (as compared to humans of Earth, not the Green Men of Barsoom), problem-solving skills, intelligence, and luck. It&amp;#8217;s like God rolled a series of &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=natural%2020"&gt;natural 20s&lt;/a&gt; when He was creating Carter, and Carter knows exactly how to take advantage of that. He instantly figures out how to move in Mars&amp;#8217;s lower gravity. He applies his knowledge of battle from the Civil War to fighting alongside several different alien races. He isn&amp;#8217;t completely floored by the weird appearance of the Tharks (the green men of Mars). He learns to speak the Martian language and use Martian telepathy despite not &amp;#8212; to our knowledge, anyway &amp;#8212; knowing any languages other than English nor how to be telepathic at all beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, what&amp;#8217;s more, he instantly wins the trust of pretty much &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; around him. The few who don&amp;#8217;t like him are so clearly Stereotypical Evil Characters that the reader knows almost immediately they&amp;#8217;ll be getting some kind of comeuppance, most likely at Carter&amp;#8217;s hands (or sword).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the story is spent on getting Carter back together with Thoris &amp;#8212; they are separated in the second act &amp;#8212; and it&amp;#8217;s kind of blah through there (there&amp;#8217;s even a pod racing scene, sort of) before the grand finale, when Carter leads the good Martians against some really, really, unmistake-ably &lt;em&gt;evil&lt;/em&gt; Martians. Kind of like how, in Star Trek 6, there were honorable Klingons and evil Klingons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I really enjoyed the book. There was lots of adventure, interesting scenery and worldbuilding, and if the aliens were a little too human, that&amp;#8217;s not really a failing &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s just the way stories were written back then. Besides, the characters are consistent within themselves &amp;#8212; none of them do anything that immediately drags you out of the story. The ending wraps up a little too fast, as stories from that era were wont to do, but that&amp;#8217;s okay, because we know there&amp;#8217;ll be more John Carter of Mars stories coming up. I feel bad for readers of that era, who didn&amp;#8217;t know there&amp;#8217;d be more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Princess of Mars&lt;/em&gt; is short enough that you can read it in a weekend, if you read at a good clip. The version I have has some very nice illustrations by Thomas Yeates, and an introduction by Mike Ashley that lays out the history of the Barsoom series. The book itself is suitable for reading by mature tweens who are already into sci-fi or adventure stories, though the illustrations do contain PG-13 nudity (Carter himself shows up naked on Mars, and to assimilate with the Tharks, he forgoes clothing as they do). I&amp;#8217;m glad I picked it up, and I&amp;#8217;m currently enjoying the second book, &lt;em&gt;Gods of Mars&lt;/em&gt;, which is part of the omnibus.&lt;/p&gt;

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignright" title="Zero History" src="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/underwire/2010/09/Zero-History-cover.jpg" alt="" width="116" height="180" /&gt;With the possible exception of the Very Ugly Shirt, I think I&amp;#8217;ve seen all of the technology in &lt;a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;William Gibson&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; new novel,&lt;em&gt; Zero History&lt;/em&gt;, featured on &lt;a href="http://boingboing.net"&gt;BoingBoing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Zero History&lt;/em&gt; is a science fiction novel because a science fiction writer wrote it. If it had been written by someone other than William Gibson, it could have been shelved with the thrillers. On the other hand, &lt;em&gt;Zero History&lt;/em&gt; does two things that science fiction is supposed to do: It examines the impact of technology on human beings; and if the science was taken out, the plot wouldn&amp;#8217;t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hubertus Bigend, the eccentric billionaire from &lt;em&gt;Pattern Recognition&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Spook Country&lt;/em&gt;, once again recruits the former rock star, Hollis Henry. This time he&amp;#8217;s tracking a fashion genius whose anti-advertising has created an underground sensation. With the former benzo addict Milgrim, would-be military contractors, and a surprisingly straightforward romantic subplot, William Gibson pulls together another intricate and enthralling novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this book to be more ambivalent than the other two. Fear drives the characters. I have not figured out what Hollis is running from, aside from her mysterious and frightening benefactor. Milgrim is remembering what fear is like without sedatives to insulate him from the world. The generalized paranoia that underlies modern military-worship keeps the nominal bad guys moving through a series of misunderstood signals that might have been comic if the stakes didn&amp;#8217;t feel so high. At the end, despite the protagonists&amp;#8217; celebrations, I had the unsettling impression that the bad guys won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zero History&lt;/em&gt; is a continuation of the series that started with &lt;em&gt;Pattern Recognition&lt;/em&gt;. It brings back both the style and many of the characters from those books, not his earlier work. Gibson&amp;#8217;s precisely-machined writing is a pleasure to read, as always. He lets his plot drift, so it feels like all the characters are sliding slowly and inevitably towards towards a single point of crisis. While &lt;em&gt;Zero History&lt;/em&gt; never reaches the frenzy I remember from other Gibson novels, it kept me engaged until the end. Also, I adored the bit with the penguin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will reread this book.&lt;em&gt; Zero History&lt;/em&gt; is not a stand-alone novel, and I believe I will benefit from reading the whole series in order. Readers who are looking for a return to &lt;em&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/em&gt; will be disappointed. Fans of the other Bigend books should pick this one up, too.&lt;/p&gt;

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;For my part, I prefer aliens that look alien. Then when they ritually&#160;eat their first-born, or turn arthropod halfway through their&#160;life-cycle, it isn&amp;#8217;t so much of a shock. You expect it. Humanoid&#160;aliens, they&amp;#8217;re trouble.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&amp;#8211; Mary Gentle, &lt;strong&gt;The Golden Witchbreed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I finally picked up Mary Gentle&amp;#8217;s science fiction&#160;duology, The Golden Witchbreed and its sequel, Ancient Light. The&#160;story that begins in The Golden Witchbreed is standard SF: A human&#160;ambassador arrives on an alien world to assist the first contact team,&#160;and finds herself snarled in local politics. The difference lies,&#160;first, in what those local politics turn out to be, and second, in&#160;Mary Gentle&amp;#8217;s deft handling of character and interwoven plotlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alien planet, Orthe, is inhabited by humanoid aliens who are just&#160;human enough to make the ambassador trip up &amp;#8212; and the reader, too, if&#160;she&amp;#8217;s not careful. The Ortheans are drawn with superb attention to&#160;detail. Most of the aliens that the reader meets in The Golden&#160;Witchbreed live in small holdings that answer to a larger,&#160;elected-as-needed assembly of representatives, and an elected monarch&#160;who rules by divine right. Mary Gentle does not make the mistake of&#160;having a One World Culture for her aliens, however, or even just a few&#160;variations on a theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the ambassador travels away from the capital city, the reader gets&#160;to see one culture shade into another. I enjoyed watching the&#160;ambassador slowly adapt to Orthe. As her grasp of the language and&#160;social niceties moves from being trained, to being practiced, to being&#160;second nature, the vocabulary in her narration changes. The humans&#160;have classed the Ortheans as a pretech, but when a group of Barbarians&#160;arrive in the hollowed-out hull of an ancient flying machine, both the&#160;reader and the ambassador realize that something far stranger is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Golden Witchbreed is a good book, but it is not a complete story&#160;without Ancient Light. Ancient Light begins twenty years after the&#160;ambassador leaves Orthe. Political upheaval on Earth has left her&#160;without a government to represent &amp;#8212; instead, she answers to the&#160;Company. Having discovered the ruins of an ancient civilization on&#160;Orthe, the Company wants to know whether any of the alien technology&#160;could be put to human use. Alien politics, human politics, alien&#160;religion, and the ambassador&amp;#8217;s own shaky hold on her sanity raise the&#160;stakes in Ancient Light to the point where I finished this book&#160;standing up &amp;#8212; because finding a chair would have meant looking away&#160;from the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orthe is a world so finely balanced that mere observation by an&#160;outsider is enough to change the system. To me, these books read as a&#160;statement about invasion and colonization, though Mary Gentle never&#160;wields the message stick hard enough to make me confident that&amp;#8217;s what she was trying to say. The Orthe duology is good science fiction, and&#160;has as much to say about our past as our future. I recommend these&#160;books without hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kachikachi Yama&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
By Michael R. Underwood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The howl of the  northbound train builds in crescendo as I stand on the ledge of the  platform and hold the man above the tracks.&#160; He flails at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shikoku station is far from empty.&#160; Groaning bodies dot the  otherwise hospital-clean platform. A group of fleshmodded Gothic Lolita  girls watch us.&#160; They look on with inhumanly white faces and void-black  eyes.&#160; Twig-thin arms down to their knees wave in the wind. He begs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My _denkigami&#8217;s_ polite but insistent voice chirps  in my head.&#160; _&#8220;Yamagata-sama orders the target to be eliminated.&#8221;_  Spirit of the fleshware machine in my brain, my _denkigami_ is a  constant companion, and keeper of my leash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roar of the train grows louder, and bells ring in the  station.&#160; The man pleads for his life.&#160; The train&#8217;s lights appear from  around the around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://escapepod.org/2010/11/11/ep-266-kachikachi-yama"&gt;Keep reading&amp;#8230;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-1465"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160; *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My daimyo&#8217;s summons  comes at 3:27 in the morning.&#160; My _denkigami_ wakes me, and within  minutes I crawl through the servant&#8217;s entrance to his office, dressed  and ready in simple white silk kimono, my hair in a topknot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walls of his office are covered in the finest works from a  millennium&#8217;s worth of painters.&#160; Basho, Caravaggio, Monet, Kiefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yamagata  Kenichiro has never met my gaze.&#160; My father served him and his father,  and I will know no other master until I retire as a nun or die in his  service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samurai.&#160; From _Samuru_&amp;#8211;&#8220;to serve.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yamagata-sama  grunts. &#8220;My honor has been violated.&#8221;&#160; He pushes a digital tablet  across his desk.&#160; The tablet shows a 360-degree image of a  fleshmod-tanned hacker in his twenties, data-port centered in a swirling  tattoo on the back of his neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yamagata stands and places a hand on the desk. &#8220;This criminal has brought shame upon my wife and upon my house.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What is your desire, lord?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yamagata-sama&#8217;s eyes narrow.&#160; &#8220;First, befriend him.&#160; Then, humiliate him.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has not ordered me to do this before. &#8220;Why not just kill him, lord?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yamagata  slams his fist on the table. &#8220;It is not enough.&#8221;&#160; He walks around the  table, leans over me and draws a finger down my face and across my  chin.&#160; &#8220;He must know ecstasy before he knows agony.&#8221;&#160; I restrain the  shudder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has always treated me like a woman first, a serving maid who  could kill instead of a worthy member of a noble line.&#160; This is not a  job for a samurai, but I do not have a choice.&#160; I serve him to honor my  family&#8217;s name, prove that we were worthy of elevation to the samurai  caste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take the tablet with both hands as I bow.&#160; I crawl back through  the low gap in the synthetic rice-paper walls while the side door&amp;#8211;the  one for his peers&amp;#8211;remains closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160; *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pore  over the files at the steel desk in my modest apartment in the servant&#8217;s  wing.&#160; A seven-mat front room large enough for a couch and exercise  equipment, and a five-mat bedroom room connected to a compact bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetic _shoji_ walls give me no privacy, thin as rice-paper but  made of plastic.&#160; My red-lacquered family shrine stands centered on my  dresser.&#160; When I was a child, I slept in the front room, &#8216;my&#8217; walls  covered in holoposters of the latest idols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target&#8217;s alias is &#8220;Tanuki&#8221;&amp;#8211;the raccoon-dog trickster of ancient folklore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A  flash of memory&amp;#8211;ancestral armor and bound bamboo. Lessons on  _bushido_. &#8220;The way of the past is a unified one, my little rabbit.&#160;  Samurai must listen to the past and speak to the future.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so father insisted that I learn the old tales in addition to the  old skills.&#160; He always taught two things at once: religion and  endurance; bullets and _bushido_.&#160; To fail either lesson was to fail  both.&#160; He wanted a son, but since Empress Toshi wed the first Imperial  Denkigami and proclaimed the second restoration, women have been allowed  to bear the _daisho_&amp;#8211;the paired _katana_ and _wakizashi_&amp;#8211;so that they  might serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father taught me how to live.&#160; Now I have my _denkigami_ and Yamagata-sama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dossier gives his school background, address, frequent haunts, and a detailed psychological profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yamagata&#8217;s  orders will force me to do things below my station, but I am thankful  it does not involve killing.&#160; I have murdered fifty-seven people by  Yamagata-sama&#8217;s bidding, and in slumber, I still hear each of their  screams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160; *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &#8216;randomly&#8217; meet Tanuki at a hacker caf&#233; in  the Akihabara district, known more commonly now as Kachikachi Yama, the  &#8216;matchstick mountain,&#8217; where the fire of creativity burns hottest and  brightest, most creative and most dangerous.&#160; It is the home of the  elite _tensai_ hackers and aspirants alike.&#160; I spend an hour in front of  the mirror, painting myself like a Heian-era lady-in-waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The caf&#233; is decorated like the digital heaven _Denkigoku_  itself, great clouds for the lampshades, the bar rising out of sea-blue  floor, the design a stylized island from an ancient painting.&#160; Intense  colors and soft lines make the building into a waking dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not three paces into the caf&#233; and I catch his eye.&#160; The profile  tells me he likes the classical beauties, no obvious fleshmods&amp;#8211;strange  contrast to his profession.&#160; I wonder, who is this man really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I  order a green tea and flirt with the peek of a wrist as I inhale the  steam rolling off the cup.&#160; Then I approach the table with the tiny  steps required in my many layers of _kimono_.&#160; I miss my loose fighting  clothes and their freedom of motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;May I join you?&#8221; Classical beauties yes, but he liked his women  aggressive.&#160; He rubs his shaved head and gestures to the seat.&#160;  &#8220;Please.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set down the tea and sit daintily, playing my  part.&#160; I think of his work, and begin to play him like a dating sim.&#160;  After hours studying his file, I know which movies to hate, what media  feeds to quote. I play the part of a devoted fan.&#160; I am his desires  sculpted into flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160; *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We go out twice before I begin to do  Yamagata-sama&#8217;s bidding.&#160; My _denkigami_ reminds me always of my orders,  so I move more quickly to avoid its censure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember my  father on the floor, a broken island in a still ocean of blood, the  crater in the back of his head his punishment for refusing an unjust  order.&#160; I obey my _denkigami_.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160; *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stand on an open plain, wheat stalks swaying in the digital wind of _Denkigoku_.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He  is teaching me to hack.&#160; An attempt at romance.&#160; I hear my father&#8217;s  voice in my head. &#8220;For the samurai, every experience is a lesson.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanuki&#8217;s avatar is the squat raccoon dog which gives him his  handle&amp;#8211;with comically-oversized testicles hanging to the ground.&#160; Mine  is a samurai woman in kabuki style, all in red, lacquered armor and  painted face&amp;#8211;red streaks over a white base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says my avatar is cute.&#160; I ignore the urge to rip off the tanuki&#8217;s testicles.&#160; I listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanuki activates a protective _denkigami_, a blue-skinned _oni_ with four arms and Indian clothes.&#160; It stands at attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every _denkigami_ has a counter.&#160; Like rock-paper-scissors with a thousand symbols.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He  activates the program, and the _oni_ levels its weapons at Tanuki.&#160;  &#8220;Unauthorized passage is not allowed.&#160; Please provide your access code.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanuki strokes the fur on his chin. &#8220;With the right program, any  _denkigami_ can be conquered.&#8221; He reaches between his legs and pulls out  a pair of fans.&#160; Doing a dance with the fans, he leaps side to side and  the _oni_ drops its guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Proceed, honored guest.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He bests another dozen _denkigami_  to show his prowess.&#160; Each time, he knows the perfect tool.&#160; He holds up  a _naginata_, the traditional weapon of a noblewoman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is  how I hacked the _denkigami_ of the wife of a corporate daimyo.&#160; To beat  a _denkigami_, turn its power against itself, make it follow the rules  that control it in a way that forces it to obey your request.&#160; With this  icon, I turned her resentment against Yamagata&#8217;s control into a  weapon.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I smile and flatter him.&#160; I learn two lessons&amp;#8211; deception and hacking.&#160; My father would approve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanuki&#8217;s  show is complete, and my true task begins.&#160; I meditated on this, asked  my father for guidance on the unjust order.&#160; But I am samurai, and I  must serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We leave _Denkigoku_ after his lesson, return to his spartan  apartment.&#160; To show my &#8216;thanks,&#8217; for his indulgence, I take him to bed.&#160;  He is enthusiastic, clumsy, and greedy, drinking of my body.&#160; I close  my eyes and think of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160; *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_Denkigoku_ swirls into being when I dream, and I am again trapped by the spirits of those I&#8217;d killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I  lay on a green island floating in the vast sea of heaven, home to  machine spirits, the restless dead and the great spirits of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naked.&#160; I&#8217;m always naked.&#160; My protestation of purity or my weakness  before their rage?&#160; I stand and snap off a branch from the island&#8217;s lone  bamboo tree and hold it like a blade.&#160; I wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They come in twos  and threes, shining echoes of my victims.&#160; Carried on the winds of  their screams, they fly at me; form a cloud as I wave them away with the  branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plead with the dead. &#8220;Enough!&#160; You must move on!&#160; It was my duty!&#8221; the same words, the same response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Murderer!&#160; Demon!&#160; Vengeance!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They  tear at me with bloodied claws.&#160; The cuts cover my body in waves as the  branch passes through their red-soaked clothes.&#160; A hand slaps away the  branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They knock me to the ground, and I curl into a shaking ball as their  screams mix with the sharp wind.&#160; My scream joins the chorus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160; *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanuki  leaps out of bed when I wake him with my screams.&#160; He tries to comfort  me, his arm around my shoulders.&#160; I escape to his shower and shudder  alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrapped in his black towels, I bring him tea when I return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanuki  leans back and strokes a beard he doesn&#8217;t have. We lounge on a bed  three times the size of my futon, with real silk sheets, a memory-shaped  mattress, and mahogany bedposts in western style.&#160; His fleshmod tan  glistens in the afterglow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a night of drenched sheets, spent condoms and still-echoing electronic bass, I move to the next part of the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I heard about this new fleshware modification.&#160; They say it is wonderful for hackers.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Which one?&#8221; he asks.&#160; As if there&#8217;s the possibility he has not heard of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s  a selective synasthesia.&#160; Good for working in _Denkigoku_ for hacking.&#160;  So I hear.&#8221;&#160; The smallest edge in the machine spirit world can mean the  difference between glory and humiliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He nods. &#8220;A few of the _tensai_ have it.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;And you&#8217;re  a _tensai_.&#8221; I smile wide and make him believe I think he is one of the  elite. &#8220;I think we should go and get it together.&#8221; My fingers trace  along his chin.&#160; He shivers, and the sheets shift over his groin. &#8220;I  don&#8217;t think I need it,&#8221; he says with a smile of his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I want you to hear my kisses and taste my moans, Tanuki.&#160; To  dance to the symphony of you in me.&#160; Will you do that, for us?&#8221;&#160;  Yamagata has made a samurai into a common concubine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I push aside the sheets and slide my hands up his chest.&#160; He dissembles, and I grit my teeth to contain my frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re tensai, but with this, you could be _Tensai Ichiban_.&#8221;&#160;  _Tensai Ichiban_, the number one hacker in the world, a coveted position  which led to many hackers&#8217; ends by blades or bullets in back alleys or  digital mountaintops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He leans back, looks at his wall of hardware, staring past the screens into his imagined future. &#8220;_Tensai Ichiban_.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160; *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_Hanamichi_  is my favorite fleshware parlor, I tell Tanuki.&#160; They are actually a  new Yamagata-Corp acquisition, but the deal has yet to reach the media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep blue mood lighting fills the room, with gel-sculpted  couches, news feeds on the wall-panels, and local rock DJ-ed off one of  the flesh artist&#8217;s rigs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our artist is agelessly young,  fleshmodded to look like a golden age _anime_ heroine.&#160; Her eyes take up  a quarter of her face, and her mouth is no wider than my thumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artist explains the procedure to Tanuki.&#160; The synasthetic  mod is sculpted to the sensory system, acting as a processing center for  sensory input.&#160; Left alone, it channels the information to the  traditional centers.&#160; When accessed consciously, it takes sensory input  and redirects it to be processed by other modalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanuki nods and I can see him salivating at what the fleshmod can  give him&amp;#8211;the edge in _Denkigoku_, the power needed to vie to be _Tensai  Ichiban_.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what I want him to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160; *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recover from the procedure for a week, letting the brain  acclimate to the possibilities.&#160; The whole time, Tanuki can only talk  about becoming _Tensai Ichiban_.&#160; He ignores the fleshmodder&#8217;s advice  and drinks, smokes, and paces around his apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is going to be amazing, Yuriko.&#8221; He knows me by my mother&#8217;s name.&#160; She took her life when my father died.&#160; I was fifteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Most  of these losers, they don&#8217;t even know about this.&#8221; He taps his head  where the skull was pulled back.&#160; He winces, teeth flashing through a  grimace. &#8220;Everything in _Denkigoku_ will be different.&#160; Data will sing.&#160;  Graphics will boil my blood.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I smile again, and pretend to be weak from the procedure he thinks I  have had with him.&#160; The fleshmod artist merely gave me the appropriate  scar, perpendicular five-centimeter cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That fucker Yamagata will never know what hit him.&#160; It&amp;#8221;ll even top what I did to his wife.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yamagata?&#160; As in the Yamagata Corporation?&#8221;&#160; Feigning interest  is not hard, this time.&#160; Hearing his side might illuminate  Yamagata-sama&#8217;s motivations for making a concubine of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After  I slipped into his personal datanet and hacked his wife&#8217;s _denkigami_, I  had her go to him and screw.&#160; He was surprised at first, but he got so  into it!&#160; I had them do the dirtiest stuff&amp;#8230;I doubt they&#8217;d screwed  since she squeezed out his heir!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanuki clapped like a giddy child. &#8220;And then, just as he was finishing, I hacked her voicebox and told him what I did!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This  was the affront that Yamagata-sama had assigned me to revenge.&#160;  Embarrassment for embarrassment.&#160; Tanuki should notice my flared  nostrils, the clenched fingers, but he isn&#8217;t even looking at me anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;And now I&#8217;m going to rob him blind so we can go around the world, Yuriko.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I giggle for him, hand over mouth.&#160; I hate Tanuki for the way I have to act.&#160; I hate Yamagata-sama more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160; *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanuki buys sake and decorates his apartment, makes a party of  his first journey to _Denkigoku_ after having the synasthetic installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I  wanted it to be the two of us, but he insisted.&#160; Eight of his hacker  friends are there, all fake-tanned like him, small men with big egos.&#160;  They congregate and talk about clan raids on the latest online pro  circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has three oversized screens suspended from the ceiling,  usually for his casual viewing pleasure.&#160; Tonight, we will watch him as  he goes in for Yamagata Corp&#8217;s payroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few drinks,  some ranting about his expertise and the corruption of the Zaibatsu  feudal system, Tanuki begins.&#160; He spreads the rice, says the chant, and  plugs in to make the journey to _Denkigoku_.&#160; There, hackers style  themselves warriors battling digital _oni_ security systems and currying  favor with the _denkigami_, machine spirits of the new Japanese empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my signal, my _denkigami_ makes the call to Yamagata-sama&#8217;s  men.&#160; Its voice gives me confirmation.&#160; _&#8220;We will wait now.&#160;  Yamagata-sama will be pleased.&#8221;_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surreal world of  _Denkigoku_ swirls into visibility on the three screens.&#160; Painted clouds  in ancient style dot the electric-blue sky, ten thousand _denkigami_  flying through the air, the traffic constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He walks across moss-covered bridges in the old style, under rows of  towering red _torii_&amp;#8211;the sacred gates separating common space from the  sacred territory of the Yamagata Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanuki is  salivating like a dog, so enthralled by the synasthetic.&#160; He brags as he  goes.&#160; &#8220;This is amazing!&#160; The air tastes like salmon.&#160; The _torii_  sound like bells.&#8221;&#160; Yuri, I wish you were here with me.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sip sake and watch as Tanuki walks into the trap Yamagata-sama has prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  white walls of Yamagata&#8217;s castle stretch three screens high, the  representation of the corporation&#8217;s digital holdings in _Denkigoku_.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanuki&#8217;s waddling avatar approaches the gate, facing looming  _oni_ with black skin and bulbous tusks and weapons three times his  size.&#160; He laughs, his hands coursing through the air making commands.&#160;  The avatar reaches into its crotch to pull out the digital tool he would  use to trick his way past the _oni_ security.&#160; Tanuki told me he  planned to use a hypnotic program he had been working on, represented by  a vintage _pokemon_.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, his avatar pulls up a flapping _koi_ fish, which  splashes water in his face.&#160; The avatar stumbles backwards and lands on  top of the oversized testicles.&#160; The _oni_ draw closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Please  provide your security code!&#8221;&#160; Their voices bellow through Tanuki&#8217;s  speakers, maxing the audio.&#160; The sound waves crash against my chest, and  I take another sip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#160; Come on, work, dammit!&#8221; Tanuki scrambles  backwards, flailing for the tool he needs, but all that will come out  are _koi_, each more unwieldy and useless than the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  _oni_ run him off with pounding threats, and Tanuki&#8217;s so-called friends  laugh.&#160; The piggyback program does its duty.&#160; The synasthesia is  selective as promised in the earthly realm, but in _Denkigoku_, it is  completely random and incomprehensible.&#160; His mind is convinced sounds  are touches, tastes are vision.&#160; He will be permanently disabled in  _Denkigoku_, never able to hack again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yamagata-sama&#8217;s revenge is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160; *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I  sit once more in Yamagata-sama&#8217;s study, in the attentive _seiza_  posture, feet and ankles tucked beneath me.&#160; I have given my report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yamagata-sama strokes his beard and grunts wordless phrases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Well  done.&#160; However, I am not satisfied.&#160; He will suffer for a month, and  then you will dispose of him.&#160; Take him to Shikoku.&#160; Leave his body  there.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bow.&#160; Fifty-seven spirits plague my dreams, and now  Yamagata-sama is telling me there will be one more, a tanuki with  plastic glasses.&#160; First he debases me, and then makes my demeaning act a  cruel prelude to murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I crawl out of Yamagata&#8217;s office and return to my apartment to prepare.&#160; I burn incense for my parents and go to kill Tanuki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160; *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanuki  proves himself not a total fool.&#160; Five tattooed yakuza surround me in  the train station when I arrive, razorwire blades and outlawed guns  trained on me.&#160; My hand rests on the hilt of my blade.&#160; I wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanuki gloats. &#8220;Hello lover. A friend of mine tipped me off, so I  thought I&#8217;d bring some friends on our getaway trip.&#160; How pissed do you  think he&#8217;ll be when I send his samurai lapdog&#8217;s head back to him?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#8217;t bother to respond.&#160; The game is over; I do not have to pretend for him anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long moment, the world is still, six bodies ready to explode into motion while Tanuki stands back and laughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A  tall man with a red dragon tattoo around his torso flinches, takes a  stutter-step forward.&#160; I leap and draw.&#160; Ancient steel cuts through  fleshmodded muscle.&#160; An arm hits the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spin with soft steps, turning to keep the other four in my sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My  _denkigami_ chirps a warning in my head. _&#8220;Overhand blow, position  seven.&#8221;_ It warns me in time to tilt to the side and let the thin blade  cut the air beside my ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two yakuza tackle me, thinking their mass enough to overpower  one small woman, samurai or not.&#160; We crash into a pillar and my head  cracks against marble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My _katana_ bursts from the back of  one&amp;#8211;impaled by his own momentum.&#160; I push and spin to pull out the  blade.&#160; I slice at his companion, face fleshmodded to look like an  _oni_.&#160; His skin is red, his nose bulbous, his mouth full of fangs.&#160; My  grandfather&#8217;s sword widens his mouth to his cheekbone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two steps sideways and I reverse the blade.&#160; My head drops as I  spin in place and kick a gun out of one&#8217;s hands.&#160; _Katana_ follows foot  and splits the man&#8217;s collarbone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My _denkigami&#8217;s_ warning to  roll comes too late.&#160; Pain bursts in my back.&#160; The blade clatters on  concrete.&#160; My head cracks against the wall of a magazine stand.&#160; Two  more pains blossom in my chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A steaming gun barrel stands in the air, held by a yakuza not  out of junior high.&#160; I roll to the side and my vision tracks as if I&#8217;d  indulged in too much sake.&#160; We lock eyes.&#160; He flinches, and I pluck the  gun from his hand while he blinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sharp elbow to the temple drops him to the floor.&#160; I turn and  fire a bullet through Tanuki&#8217;s thigh as he runs up the stairs.&#160; Tossing  the gun aside, I retrieve my target.&#160; I lift him with both arms and move  to hold him over the edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160; *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lights of the train grow wider at the end of the tunnel as I hold Tanuki over the edge of the Shikoku line platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grit my teeth from the strain.&#160; I show him my real face, too long hidden behind makeup and insincere smiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am Ryoji Usagiko, vassal of Yamagata Kenichiro, and I have  been ordered to erase the stain you have made upon the honor of the  Yamagata.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Please, don&#8217;t kill me!&#160; I&#8217;ll do anything, you hear?&#160;  I&#8217;ll work for Yamagata, apologize to his wife, hand over other hackers.&#160;  Please!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will join murderers and traitors, slave-runners and callous  _ronin_, more voice in the growing chorus of my nightmares.&#160; He may  deserve death less than they, but he will scream for my death just as  loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My _denkigami_ in my head again. &#8220;The train will arrive in 7.3 seconds.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light  fills the platform. If I leave him, he will bankrupt himself seeking  revenge.&#160; I let go and watch his eyes go wide as I let go.&#160; He drops  below the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turn on the balls of my feet, walk past the nonplussed girls, and return to Tanuki&#8217;s apartment to complete one last task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&#160;&#160;&#160; *&#160;&#160;&#160; *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yamagata  smiles when I give my report.&#160; He walks out from behind his desk to set  a hand on my shoulder.&#160; I bow with my hands together, each in the  opposite sleeve of my _kimono_.&#160; The sentiment comes too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I draw the tiny knife from my sleeve and leap to my feet.&#160; The  knife draws a crimson smile across Yamagata-sama&#8217;s throat, and I drop my  former master to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My _denkigami_ would have  stopped me, stayed my hand before I could act.&#160; But I learned my lessons  well.&#160; The once-constant voice is now quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking down at my master, we lock eyes.&#160; I watch surprise mix with outrage, then give way to fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You  have violated the oaths of fealty between master and servant, dirtied  yourself and your vassals. The Ryoji family no longer has need of the  Yamagata&#8217;s patronage.&#8221; No other words have been as pleasurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weight of my father&#8217;s murder drops from my shoulders as I leave Yamagata dying on the floor.&#160; I leave by the side exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, I do not have to crawl.&lt;/p&gt;

Kachikachi Yama
By Michael R. Underwood

The howl of the  northbound train builds in crescendo as I stand on the ledge of the  platform and hold the man above the tracks.nbsp; He flails at me.

The Shikoku station is far from empty.nbsp; Groaning bodies dot the  otherwise hospital-clean platform. A group of fleshmodded Gothic Lolita  girls watch us.nbsp; They look on with inhumanly white faces and void-black  eyes.nbsp; Twig-thin arms down to their knees wave in the wind. He begs.

My _denkigamirsquo;s_ polite but insistent voice chirps  in my head.nbsp; _ldquo;Yamagata-sama orders the target to be eliminated.rdquo;_  Spirit of the fleshware machine in my brain, my _denkigami_ is a  constant companion, and keeper of my leash.

The roar of the train grows louder, and bells ring in the  station.nbsp; The man pleads for his life.nbsp; The trainrsquo;s lights appear from  around the around the corner.

Keep reading...


*nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; *nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; *

My daimyorsquo;s summons  comes at 3:27 in the morning.nbsp; My _denkigami_ wakes me, and within  minutes I crawl through the servantrsquo;s entrance to his office, dressed  and ready in simple white silk kimono, my hair in a topknot.

The walls of his office are covered in the finest works from a  millenniumrsquo;s worth of painters.nbsp; Basho, Caravaggio, Monet, Kiefer.

Yamagata  Kenichiro has never met my gaze.nbsp; My father served him and his father,  and I will know no other master until I retire as a nun or die in his  service.

Samurai.nbsp; From _Samuru_--ldquo;to serve.rdquo;

Yamagata-sama  grunts. ldquo;My honor has been violated.rdquo;nbsp; He pushes a digital tablet  across his desk.nbsp; The tablet shows a 360-degree image of a  fleshmod-tanned hacker in his twenties, data-port centered in a swirling  tattoo on the back of his neck.

Yamagata stands and places a hand on the desk. ldquo;This criminal has brought shame upon my wife and upon my house.rdquo;

ldquo;What is your desire, lord?rdquo;

Yamagata-samarsquo;s eyes narrow.nbsp; ldquo;First, befriend him.nbsp; Then, humiliate him.rdquo;

He has not ordered me to do this before. ldquo;Why not just kill him, lord?rdquo;

Yamagata  slams his fist on the table. ldquo;It is not enough.rdquo;nbsp; He walks around the  table, leans over me and draws a finger down my face and across my  chin.nbsp; ldquo;He must know ecstasy before he knows agony.rdquo;nbsp; I restrain the  shudder.

He has always treated me like a woman first, a serving maid who  could kill instead of a worthy member of a noble line.nbsp; This is not a  job for a samurai, but I do not have a choice.nbsp; I serve him to honor my  familyrsquo;s name, prove that we were worthy of elevation to the samurai  caste.

I take the tablet with both hands as I bow.nbsp; I crawl back through  the low gap in the synthetic rice-paper walls while the side door--the  one for his peers--remains closed.

*nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; *nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; *

I pore  over the files at the steel desk in my modest apartment in the servantrsquo;s  wing.nbsp; A seven-mat front room large enough for a couch and exercise  equipment, and a five-mat bedroom room connected to a compact bathroom.

Synthetic _shoji_ walls give me no privacy, thin as rice-paper but  made of plastic.nbsp; My red-lacquered family shrine stands centered on my  dresser.nbsp; When I was a child, I slept in the front room, lsquo;myrsquo; walls  covered in holoposters of the latest idols.

The targetrsquo;s alias is ldquo;Tanukirdquo;--the raccoon-dog trickster of ancient folklore.

A  flash of memory--ancestral armor and bound b...</ns2:summary>

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A friend pointed out to me on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jasonbaki" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter &lt;/a&gt;just the other day that as of this week, it is exactly one year since I picked up my first Stephen King book and started reading. That book was &lt;em&gt;Under the Dome&lt;/em&gt;, which came out in November 2009, and I was utterly enthralled from beginning to end. As soon as I had finished I set myself the task of reading all of his work, in publication order. A year later and I have only reached &lt;em&gt;The Stand&lt;/em&gt; &#8211; hey, it was a busy year &#8211; but I&#8217;m still loving every single word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/dome.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1455" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/dome.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="313" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a genre reader and writer, it might sound surprising that I came so late to King&#8217;s work. While his career has had high points and low, he is generally considered a master of science fiction, horror, and just plain &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt;, ably treading the line between vast commercial success and quality content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the reason I only came to his gigantic body of work with his latest novel is that prior to this, I was a King snob. Commercial success on such a scale usually meant &#8211; so I thought &#8211; very poor writing. This is often the case, but it was that foray &lt;em&gt;Under the Dome&lt;/em&gt; last November that taught me a very good lesson indeed, one that is second only to the pants&lt;a href="#f1"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt; rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s slightly oblique but I&#8217;ll try to explain. That lesson was: everything is about &#8216;the story&#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay?&#160;Hold tight. Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently we are continually bombarded with bad news about the publishing industry &#8211; about how publishing is on a downward slide, book sales are floundering while editors at the big houses flap to catch the next big trend or play it safe with unadventurous, unoriginal content. The industry is being shaken up by digital publishing and ebooks, while opportunities for new writers trying to get a break are shrinking more and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be easy, with all of this, to take a very bleak view, and certainly I&#8217;m not suggesting that the bad news is not true. If you were of a pessimistic nature you could lament the death of books and of writing as you sob into your cocoa in front of the TV. But there is one thing to remember amid this doom and gloom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing and &#8220;the story&#8221;, to use some quasi-mystical catch-all, is all around us. Take a look at what you do during the day &#8211; strip out the day job (unless you actually make a living writing), the chores, the laundry, brushing your teeth, and look at what you do for entertainment, and what entertains you. I&#8217;m willing to bet that most of it, maybe 90%, is &#8220;the story&#8221;. And &#8220;the story&#8221; means &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more TV shows and films now than ever, and certainly in recent years a stonkingly good selection of exceptionally high-quality ones. It&#8217;s all &#8220;the story&#8221; &#8211; fiction, written by writers. And everything that surrounds it &#8211; special effects, marketing and merchandising, even the actors, producers, directors, crew, etc &#8211;&#160;are all there to deliver &#8220;the story&#8221; to us. The world of books is just one tiny facet &#8211; there are comics, television programmes, films, and games (video or otherwise). It&#8217;s all writing. It&#8217;s all &#8220;the story&#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things really&#160;crystalized&#160;this for me. Firstly, a couple of years ago I went to a comic convention which featured a host of writers and artists from DC Comics, including their commander-in-chief, Dan DiDio. During a weekend of panels and discussions, one thing became very clear. The DC universe is one giant story, a tale so big and sprawling that it literally covers the walls of several offices in New York. The job of DC is to deliver this to us, and to continue its development before passing the baton to the next batch of creators and producers. The same can be said of Marvel, or Image, or 2000AD, or any comic publisher or endeavour. The scale of it was quite frankly mind-blowing, and I came away from that con with my first&#160;suspicions&#160;about &#8220;the story&#8221; and how it impacted practically everything I did and was interested in and did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second moment of realisation came earlier this week, when I was fortunate enough to attend a small gathering of &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; fans who were hosting an informal interview and Q&amp;amp;A with &lt;a href="http://www.daphneashbrook.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Daphne Ashbrook&lt;/a&gt;, co-star of the 1996 US/UK &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(1996_film)" target="_blank"&gt;TV movie&lt;/a&gt; with Paul McGann, currently visiting the UK. I&#8217;m a &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; fan, I&#8217;m happy to admit, but I&#8217;ve always had difficulty with the TV Movie. This &#8216;difficulty&#8217; has evolved from outright denial and upset (hey, I was a sensitive teenager in 1996) through to grudging acceptance of the production, so long as I didn&#8217;t actually have to watch it. So driving for an hour to see a co-star I wasn&#8217;t particularly interested in talk about a production I didn&#8217;t particularly care for seemed, beforehand at least, a bit of a chore. But, what the hell. When was this opportunity going to come up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it was a marvellous evening. Daphne was a delight, and kept us entertained for close to two hours on the ins and outs of her impressive career (come on, forget &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt;, she was in &lt;em&gt;Knight Rider&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The A-Team&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&lt;/em&gt;; hell,&#160;even &lt;em&gt;Murder, She Wrote&lt;/em&gt;). It was a revelation, especially when I realised that large parts of her lively discussion were her relaying to us the plot of these various shows, so we could have a better understanding of the role she played in each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There it was. &#8220;The Story&#8221;. As an experienced actor, Daphne&#8217;s job is to deliver &#8220;the story&#8221; to us.&#160; And &#8220;the story&#8221; means &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt;, plain and simple. Storytelling. Writing. Same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&#8217;s the magic advice I distilled from all of this? Give up on the novel and try a screenplay? Not at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice is to realise that &#8220;the story&#8221; is everywhere, and like the guys from Pixar keep saying, &#8220;the story is king&#8221;. With this in mind, and knowing that writing is a never-ending quest to &lt;em&gt;get better&lt;/em&gt;, it&#8217;s our job as writers to absorb as much of &#8220;the story&#8221; as we can. This means reading outside of our comfort zones and genres as well as within them &#8211; if I didn&#8217;t decide to try Stephen King I would never have discovered his extensive, and quite wonderful, back catalogue. When I was prepping to write a detective noir novel, I decided to bite the bullet and read &lt;em&gt;The Big Sleep &lt;/em&gt;by Raymond Chandler. &lt;em&gt;Whammo&lt;/em&gt;, the whole world of pulp detective fiction was opened to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/sleep.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1456" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/sleep.jpg" alt="" width="307" height="500" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One often-quoted piece of writing advice is to not just turn off your television, but to get rid of it entirely. Stephen King himself goes off on this in &lt;em&gt;On Writing&lt;/em&gt;. A lot of writers follow this advice to the letter and do very well indeed. But personally I think this is missing the point, because between the inane loops of twenty-four hour news, reality shows and quizzes, the blowhards that King describes so well in his memoir of the craft, there is some damn good stuff on, be it a television series (old or new) or a film (old or new). So if &#8220;the story&#8221; is about writing, then by picking and choosing carefully and by not letting it become a&#160;time-sink&#160;(and that really is where the danger lies and the advice stems from, I think), you can watch, enjoy, and &lt;em&gt;learn from&lt;/em&gt; some very, very good examples of the craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The story&#8221; is everywhere, and where the story is, you&amp;#8217;ll find writing. That will never, ever go away, no matter what weekly slice of negativity comes from the traditional publishing industry. The world needs writers and always will, because our whole lives are based around storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read books. Watch TV. Go to the movies. But importantly, read something you might not have thought you&#8217;d like, and watch a film that isn&#8217;t quite the genre you are interested in. At worst, you&#8217;ll absorb another little slice of &#8220;the story&#8221; that you wouldn&#8217;t have otherwise and you&#8217;ll learn something from it. At best, you&#8217;ll discover something new and wonderful and whole news worlds will instantly become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then think about it, and learn from it, and &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a name="f1"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt; The pants rule is pretty simple and surprisingly effective: when writing comes up on your schedule, make sure you are up and doing and dressed. Don&#8217;t write in your pyjamas, don&#8217;t write in your slippers, no matter how appealing or comfortable it may sound. By &#8220;pants&#8221;, I mean trousers (not, as British people use it, as underpants&amp;#8230; stop sniggering at the back there!), but that&#8217;s just a metaphor for being prepared and ready to write. The more prepped you are &#8211; showered, shaved, dressed, in a nice pair of shoes &#8211; the better your writing. If you want writing to be your job then act like it. Put on a nice shirt, or skirt, not just your comfy &#8220;at home&#8221; clothes. You can put those on when you&#8217;ve finished your job. In fact, the more formal you make it, the better you tend to feel (although I can&#8217;t imagine what happens to your writing if you turn up at your desk in full evening wear or a&#160;ball gown&#8230; I must give that a go sometime). Try it. It works!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.maryrobinettekowal.com/"&gt;&lt;img class="alignright" style="margin: 3px;" title="Shades of Milk and HOney" src="http://www.tianevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ShadesOfMilkAndHoney-263x400.jpg" alt="" width="263" height="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;While I do not read romances, and I have not read a book by Jane Austen since high school, I nevertheless decided to pick up Shades of Milk and Honey by &lt;a href="http://www.maryrobinettekowal.com/"&gt;Mary Robinette Kowal&lt;/a&gt;. She is a brilliant writer, and I trusted her to write something I could endure. As it turned out, enduring the book wasn&amp;#8217;t a problem &amp;#8212; the hard part was putting it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice of detail in Shades of Milk and Honey is exquisite. Everything is described in spare, precise language. I can still see the glass cherries, the nymph&amp;#8217;s face hidden in the tree, the dark and stormy bedroom of a heartsick girl. There is not a single wasted word or padded scene. That makes Shades of Milk and Honey a quick read. There is very little action until the dramatic ending, but that does not slow the narrative down. The majority of the book is concerned with interactions between people &amp;#8212; with word and gesture, thought and response. I found it enthralling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the plot will be familiar to readers of romance. Two sisters named Jane and Melody try to walk the narrow path that society has marked for them, with the threat of scandal and ruin pressing in on both sides. Mary Robinette Kowal does not pull her punches in her portrayal of traditional marriage as an economic arrangement between families. As the sisters cannot inherit, they must either marry well or fall into poverty when their father dies. Romance in this setting is a matter of survival. Melody, who is beautiful, has no shortage of suitors. Jane, on the other hand, is cursed with a big nose and brown hair, and believes that she will never find a husband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aspect of the book that has gotten the most attention is its magic. Mary Robinette Kowal has made her book&amp;#8217;s magic small and subtle, to avoid breaking history. This was not an easy task, and she has spoken at length about it elsewhere. The magic is called Glamour. It is the art of folding the ether to produce small illusions &amp;#8212; a dress on a mannequin, a piece of ambient music to liven a party, or an elaborate &amp;#8220;glamural&amp;#8221; that turns a room into a forest glade. Jane has a particular talent for glamour, which gets her into trouble before it gets her out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as the magic has been carefully constructed so as to allow the Regency period to proceed more or less as it did in the real world, the language in Shades of Milk and Honey has been chosen to fit the period. Modern readers will notice obvious examples of archaic English, such as &amp;#8220;shew,&amp;#8221; but the overall effect is wonderfully subtle, making the book feel right without distracting the reader. Shades of Milk and Honey is a deceptively simple book resting on a foundation of solid research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am told that there are plans for another book, which will involve swashbuckling. I can&amp;#8217;t wait. I had my doubts about this book at first, but I&amp;#8217;m glad I gave it a chance, and I am looking forward to the sequel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLANETFALL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
by Michael C. Lea&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galthas Talisar stepped out from the buzzing chaos of the transportal and onto lush greenery.  This world was alien, to be sure, but the patterns were almost familiar.  The ship&amp;#8217;s oracles had chosen well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind him, the transportal hummed again.  An armored leg emerged and carefully found its footing on the blue-green ferns carpeting the jungle floor.  More than twenty thousand miles above, the leg&amp;#8217;s owner shifted his weight and stepped fully through an identical transportal, instantly emerging on the planet&amp;#8217;s surface below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That cautious step belonged to Urjik, who could be called cautious in few other ways.  In fact, his reputation had left him few other options for a willing partner on this mission.  Urjik did not care. He and Galthas had fought together against the worst the Zayeen had to offer.  He trusted Galthas implicitly, despite his disdain for the other scrawny ascetics from Signet Battalion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urjik&amp;#8217;s greenish skin and jutting lower canines marked him as a charuk, his bloodline tainted by nether influences.  Despite this stigma, and despite his temper, he had risen quickly in Rampart Battalion.  Even the most burdensome battlesuit did not slow him, and no one was a truer shot with an inferno cannon or a hex-impelled railgun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://escapepod.org/2010/11/18/planetfall/"&gt;Read More&amp;#8230;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-1493"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galthas, by contrast, had the pale skin and slight build of the feytouched.  Unarmored and with no visible arms, he was nowhere near as physically imposing as Urjik.  Those who had seen Signet Battalion in action, however, knew that his bulky cold-iron armbands were weapons as formidable as any firearm or battleaxe, and far more versatile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Air&amp;#8217;s a little thick,&amp;#8221; Urjik said, &amp;#8220;but it breathes.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I could have told you that,&amp;#8221; Galthas replied softly, &amp;#8220;since you insisted I go first.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urjik flashed a tusky grin.  &amp;#8220;I thought that was protocol,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;I always follow protocol.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galthas frowned back over his shoulder at the armored charuk, but said nothing.  His companion was irrepressible, but Galthas had not quite recovered the use of his sense of humor yet.  It was one more thing the Zayeen had taken.  Perhaps here, on this world, they could find themselves again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transportal winked out behind them, the thaumaturgic sigil in its keystone deactivated from the other side.  No one else would be coming through.  For such a vital mission there would ordinarily be at least a full squadron, with clockwork or golems for logistical support. Here, as on dozens of other mission sites, there were only resources for a two-man team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Which way is it?&amp;#8221; Urjik asked, looking around warily.  The air was warm and humid, and buzzed with strange insects like fat blue bees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We should be within twenty meters,&amp;#8221; Galthas said.  &amp;#8220;This way, I think.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They moved through the brush, Galthas sliding quietly, Urjik with the subtlety of a tank.  His armor&amp;#8217;s servos whined as he plowed through flora and fauna alike.  The cluster of large multicolored crystals jutting from the center of the armor&amp;#8217;s back glowed as the suit drew power from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The undergrowth thinned.  A clearing lay just beyond.  They could feel a vibration in the air&#184; an indefinable high-energy presence, like a gathering thunderstorm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galthas turned back.  &amp;#8220;Ready?&amp;#8221; he asked.  &amp;#8220;Either this is it, or this is something very bad.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urjik hefted his high-powered Vindocladian inferno cannon to his shoulder and aimed its sigil-carved barrel into the clearing.  Inside the bulky rifle&amp;#8217;s main housing, a nether imp was caged, writhing in immortal fury but jacketed securely in heavy-duty curse-proofed lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;One of these days that thing&amp;#8217;s going to backfire,&amp;#8221; Galthas said, &amp;#8220;and all your kids will end up with tentacles.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urjik shrugged.  &amp;#8220;They&amp;#8217;re already gonna have tusks.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galthas silently parted the foliage and advanced into the clearing. The source of the disturbance in the air was immediately apparent.  In the center of a small field of yellow-orange flowers, a geyser of light fountained six meters into the air, too bright to look at. Galthas looked down at his armbands.  The fey glyphs carved into them were shining with power.  Behind him, Urjik struggled with his rifle as if fighting recoil; the angry imp inside was soaking up energy. His armor&amp;#8217;s fuel-crystals grew brighter, their flaws and occlusions shining like stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Bespeak the ship,&amp;#8221; Galthas said, his voice heavy with emotion.  &amp;#8220;Tell them the oracles were correct.  Tell them we&amp;#8217;ve found a sourcewell.&amp;#8221; Tell them the lights will stay on and the ships will not starve.  Tell them our world is dying, but our people may yet survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people on Ashter had heard of the Zayeen before they came roaring out of hyperspace bent on genocide, but few thought much about them. They were frequent trading partners, but casual visits in either direction were rare.  Their world Zayid was rich in certain rare earths and metals, but the people themselves were generally regarded as physically repugnant and culturally backward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zayeen were fanatical servants of a harsh and exacting deity, while the Ashterites practiced a genial animism whose very formlessness offended their rigid neighbors.  In order to secure a vital trade route, the Ashterite military had established a base on Zayid, inadvertently trespassing on one of many holy lands and thus sowing the seeds of their own eventual ruin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resentment on Zayid built over generations, until a swift and bloody coup left the Crusader faction in charge.  The first wave of the Holy Zayeen Crusade departed for Ashter within weeks of the coup.  In terms of technology, they were completely outmatched by the Ashterite military, but they brought with them a secret weapon that the Ashterites could never have anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zayeen Crusaders had roused their dark god from its slumber.  It flew alongside them, ringing with righteous fury, eager to descend upon the sinning Ashterites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sourcewell, of course, came with its own complications.  It seemed as if nothing would come easy, ever again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galthas and Urjik found out about the aliens immediately after bespeaking the good news back to their ship.  This close to the sourcewell, the bifurcated mimic-daemon in Urjik&amp;#8217;s thaumaturgic squawkbox transmitted powerfully and received clearly.  The mimics were bred to produce conjoined twins, and separated soon after birth. Whatever one perceived, the other repeated, no matter the distance between them.  Although the little daemons lived their entire lives separated, Galthas occasionally wondered if they ever longed for their missing halves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Urjik contacted the ship, Galthas sat and meditated on the sourcewell, feeling the fey energies dancing in his armbands.  He sat at the very edge of the grassy clearing, and came no closer to the well itself.  Any sentient being who strayed too close would be entranced, drawn irresistibly into the Source to be annihilated.  The sourcewells were vital, they were the stuff of life itself; but they were also deadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urjik&amp;#8217;s heavy tread had announced his presence long before he spoke. &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;ve got company,&amp;#8221; he said.  &amp;#8220;Maybe half a klick away.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galthas reluctantly left meditation behind.  &amp;#8220;Zayeen?&amp;#8221; he asked, eyes still closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;No,&amp;#8221; Urjik said.  &amp;#8220;Something else.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before they left, Galthas decided to conceal the sourcewell.  There was no way of knowing how the interlopers might react to it, or try to exploit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galthas fell into a stance, spreading his feet wide.  He flexed his knees, and felt the earth below hold him in its grasp.  He flattened his palms, swung his arms into the ready position, and prepared to carve his will into reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His hands moved, weaving glyphs in the air, leaving a shimmering trail hanging in the empty space behind.  Inside the bracers clasped around his forearms, captive fey wildlings shone brightly in response to his will.  Their power flowed through a web of microtubules of cold iron, spinning through complex circuits until it emerged, shaped into signs transcribed from Galthas&amp;#8217; mind onto the face of creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galthas drew a point, a line, a curve, suggesting the sweep of a clock&amp;#8217;s hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;cen(x,y,z):=-45.0892, 207.6823, 32.3342&lt;br /&gt;
rad:=20m&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, an oval circumscribed by a circle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;set perc:=from perc1 to perc5&lt;br /&gt;
for all perc from cen(x,y,z) to arc(cen,rad,360)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a Moebius-like closed loop, curving back upon itself, to establish the simple recursion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;perc:=perc+dist(dist(cen,rad),perc)&lt;br /&gt;
next perc&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glyphs hung in midair, shimmering.  Galthas waved them together. They joined, overlapping, connecting in the proper places to allow power to flow through the newly-defined system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galthas thrust his hands into the glyph, vertically aligned, right over left.  Power crackled through his armbands as they intersected the potent symbol.  He then rotated his arms, as if turning a wheel, until his hands were horizontal.  The glyph rotated with them a full quarter-turn, locking into place with an impact he could feel in the pit of his stomach.  Reality&amp;#8217;s tumblers clicked over one another, and the world was changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sourcewell and its clearing vanished instantly, replaced by more jungle.  Anyone looking in the well&amp;#8217;s direction would not only fail to see it; their steps would be guided subtly around it.  It would be safe from tampering or exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Now,&amp;#8221; Galthas said, &amp;#8220;let&amp;#8217;s go meet our visitors.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the astronomers first spotted it, they thought it was a mistake. It flew alongside the Zayeen fleet, gliding in and out of conventional space, radioactive auroras trailing in its wake in sinister serpentine waves.  When it was too consistent to be labeled a mistake, they thought it was a massive ship, a dreadnought on a scale heretofore never seen.  Even that would have been much better than the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth, which they saw once the Zayeen fleet breached visual range, was that it was a &lt;em&gt;Vulcalisk gargantua.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as the scientists on Ashter knew, no one had ever seen one alive before.  The only known specimen had been discovered near Zayid, by the Ashterite military garrison placed there.  A subsequent joint expedition had fully explored the site in all its awful grandeur.  The beast lay coiled around a shattered planetoid, with the crumbling remains of a world smeared around it as an asteroid belt.  The planetoid was scarred, obviously by the creature&amp;#8217;s external assault, but it seemed to have been shot through with a network of fine holes as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was nothing left of the planet-sized monster but bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had considered it an anomaly, a unique aberration, but they had named the species nonetheless.  It held the popular imagination on Ashter for some time; reconstructions, artistic speculations on what it had looked like alive, and even fictional entertainment featuring the gargantua as destroyer or savior were all eagerly devoured by a captivated public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Zayeen &#8211; the Zayeen had insisted it was a god.  They even had their own name for it, terrifying and unpronounceable.  They were rapturous at its discovery and thought the Ashterites&amp;#8217; whimsical fascination filthy and disrespectful.  The Ashterites, for their part, thought the talk of god-bones laughable, but never snickered too loudly or in mixed company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Zayeen emerged from hyperspace with their scaly god behind them, sculling the solar winds with its massive crocodilian tail, the Astherites stopped laughing.  They knew the Zayeen worshipped the beast, but never imagined that the fanatics could find or clone a live one, much less tame it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Vulcalisk gargantua&lt;/em&gt; tore through their defenses and blotted out the sun, hungry for the hot marrow of Ashter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aliens were &amp;#8220;something else&amp;#8221; indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their scanners revealed that the ship was like a coffin; a lifeless box of metal, hollowed out, with stubby wings that imitated flying things but were not animated by any sort of life-force.  To Galthas and Urjik, it was like seeing a rock or a corpse that flew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A door in the ship&amp;#8217;s belly hissed open, powered by some motive force that was not immediately apparent.  The thing that waddled out was tripartite; three arms, three legs, no head to speak of, a ring of watery green eyes around its midsection and a central mouth where its neck should be.  Its flesh was gray and rubbery, with irregular patchy tufts of reddish hair.  It was draped in metallic ornaments, many of which seemed permanently attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galthas and Urjik stood their ground, ready for anything.  Urjik had relegated his cannon to a shoulder mount and now held a telescoping battleaxe that he had unfolded from its housing in his armor. Galthas&amp;#8217; bracers had sprouted shimmering bucklers and stubby blades of fey energy.  Both stood ready for battle at any sign of aggression. They had been caught unawares by the Zayeen.  Never again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the tripod-thing spoke, and a box on its chest echoed its words. Galthas and Urjik both started; they were quite certain that no creature or spirit nested within the box, and a talking cube of metal was unheard of.  Unfortunately, both the tripod and the box spoke gibberish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rubbery creature pointed to the box, then to its own mouth, then to Galthas.  When there was no response, it said something unintelligible and repeated the gesture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You think it wants us to talk?&amp;#8221; Urjik asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I think so,&amp;#8221; Galthas responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they talked.  They spoke of the war.  Urjik talked of the gargantua, of how it wrapped itself around their world and sunk its teeth, with tips as broad as cities, deep into Ashter&amp;#8217;s hide.  He talked of the destruction, or claws that rent continents asunder, of the flight into their great voidfaring ships, living creatures like gigantic levitating horseshoe crabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galthas talked of the desperate fight to slay the gargantua, of witnessing the deaths of hundreds of thaumaturges of Mirror Battalion who died affixing talismans to one of the impossibly huge creature&amp;#8217;s eye-sockets.  He talked of Rampart Battalion&amp;#8217;s heroism as its fighters, Urjik among them, wielded weapons bearing talismans mated to those affixed to the gargantua.  They had fired bolt after bolt of imp-spawned hellfire, projectile after projectile, until their power crystals had all dimmed and their ammunition was exhausted.  Every shot from a thaumaturgically-marked weapon curved in its path and unerringly sought its companion talisman affixed to the gargantua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They spoke of the evacuation, of how the transportals had burned until the sourcewells sputtered out.  Until the soul of Ashter perished in one final paroxysm as the gargantua spewed the planet&amp;#8217;s lifeblood out into the void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urjik spoke fiercely of the gargantua&amp;#8217;s death-throes, of how it locked onto Asher with its tail and all six legs as it perished, curling around their world just as the ancient skeleton had been found curled around a shattered, dead planetoid.  Galthas spoke softly of the decision to flee, of the main fleet leaving Ashter to seek out another homeland, while their still battle-ready companions stayed to try to repulse the remains of the Zayeen fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the alien spoke in their language &#8211; or at least, its box did. &amp;#8220;Thanks be you for to discuss words,&amp;#8221; the box buzzed out.  &amp;#8220;This one Prime Speaker, Loban Fleet.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galthas and Urjik looked at each other.  The box was a piece of dead metal that learned languages.  They had met other spacefaring races, but this was truly alien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I am Galthas, and this is Urjik,&amp;#8221; Galthas said.  &amp;#8220;Of . . . of Ashter.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Pleased are we of Loban to know you,&amp;#8221; the Prime Speaker said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;And we . . . you,&amp;#8221; Galthas replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;For how long are you staying this orb?&amp;#8221; the alien asked bluntly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We are refugees,&amp;#8221; Galthas said.  &amp;#8220;Our home . . . can no longer support us.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Loban Prime Speaker paused.  His large green eyes blinked several times in succession.  Finally, he said, &amp;#8220;We welcome you as competitors in spirit of fair play.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urjik frowned.  Galthas held up a hand to keep him silent and said, &amp;#8220;We hope that, in this time of loss and tragedy, we can count on the assistance and cooperation of the Loban people.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We welcome all competitors who wish to contend freely,&amp;#8221; the Prime Speaker said quickly.  &amp;#8220;We seek a resource.  Spotted from high-altitude scan.  Strange light-fountain, high energy, very unusual.  Was here, but now is not.  Seen this resource, have you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#8217;s talking about the sourcewell, Galthas realized.  Was it possible that these Lobans had advanced all the way to interstellar travel without ever encountering a sourcewell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the answer, he knew that he could not risk being cut off from the well.  His entire civilization would collapse without a usable energy source.  This was all they had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We have been traveling long,&amp;#8221; Galthas said.  &amp;#8220;We are very tired.  We must return and convey your greetings to our leaders.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Loban blinked several eyes.  Maybe it was the equivalent of a nod. Then it abruptly turned and marched back into its ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night, they watched Ashter die.  They established visual communication with the ship, intending to report on their encounter with the Loban ship.  But they were confronted instead with their Section Commander, red-faced and puffy-eyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m sorry to have to be the one to show you,&amp;#8221; he said.  &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m sorry you have to see it down there alone.  But we all have to see it.  We all have to watch.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s going on?&amp;#8221; Urjik asked, although on some level, they both knew already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fresh tears coursed down the Section Commander&amp;#8217;s cheeks.  Neither Galthas nor Urjik had ever seen the man so emotional.  He angrily wiped his face with his forearm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The damn thing was hermaphroditic, or asexual, or the gods only know what,&amp;#8221; he said.  &amp;#8220;We had everyone evacuated, we had the damn Zayeen lizard-troopers on the run, we were on the verge of implementing a plan to pull their big lizard off.  Someday we might have been able to go back.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Section Commander reached for something unseen, and the image hovering above the squawkbox changed to a view of Ashter, wounded but whole.  The corpse of the reptilian gargantua was still twined about the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The science boys say the eggs must&amp;#8217;ve been encased in something super-dense, like neutronium,&amp;#8221; the Commander&amp;#8217;s voice said.  &amp;#8220;They can&amp;#8217;t figure out how any egg inside would survive that.  But we know there were two of them, and they passed right through the planet&amp;#8217;s crust like it was water.  When they sank all the way to the core they fused, and . . .&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voice broke off.  The image of the damaged planet spun quietly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When we realized what was happening, there were volunteers. Hundreds.  They took all the golems and elementals and all the burrowing clockwork they could scrape together and they went back in to try to stop it.  We weren&amp;#8217;t even sure Ashter would ever be habitable again, but they still went back in.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They could hear the Section Commander sobbing.  On the image, something strange was happening to Ashter.  Volcanoes were erupting, so many and so violently that they were visible even when viewing the whole planet.  Chunks of rock, of the planet&amp;#8217;s crust, spewed out into orbit and beyond.  But some of the chunks kept moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them . . . were something &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creatures were bursting free of the planet&amp;#8217;s crust, miniature versions of the giant lizard whose corpse draped Ashter.  Tiny in comparison to the globe itself, they still must have been as large as cities or larger.  At first just a few, then hundreds, then thousands burrowed free, bursting Ashter from within.  They swooped and dove through the planet&amp;#8217;s remains, swimming through the solar currents and breathing in the quantum fog, devouring promising possibilities and exhaling death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planet collapsed, spreading into a bloody arc.  Galthas and Urjik watched as all that was left of their world, everything they had ever known, every place they had ever lived, everything they had ever hoped or longed for or wondered about, every mystery unsolved and every story untold, everything that had ever defined home to them bled out into the vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the fragments cooled, the tiny gargantua abandoned them and turned on the corpse of their mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Always wondered what could have picked that thing down to its bones,&amp;#8221; Urjik said, his voice thick.  Galthas turned to rebuke him, but held his tongue when he saw his burly companion&amp;#8217;s face.  The charuk, too, was weeping openly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numbly, they made their report and received their orders.  Urjik wanted to attack the Loban ship right away, probably because he felt a deep need to strike back at something.  But he had a point; the sourcewell had to be defended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Command wanted information, however.  They had quietly tagged the ship thaumaturgically, so it could be monitored from a nearby squawkbox. Scouts had encountered several derelict ships on the outskirts of the system.  If they were Loban ships, the Lobans might be grateful for information about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, they were told to continue negotiating, and find out as much as possible without giving away vital information about their forces.  The Ashterites no longer had the resources to squander potential allies.  And while the temptation to inflict pain to still their own disquiet was there, High Command was determined that the remaining people of Ashter would not become like the Zayeen.  They would trust until given a reason to distrust, and seek the good in all beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We trusted the Zayeen, Galthas thought, and see where it got us.  But he accepted his orders and prepared for a long, sleepless night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day the Loban Prime Speaker asked them bluntly about their technology.  The Lobans had been monitoring them, it seemed, and regarded their equipment as strange or somehow sorcerous in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galthas pretended to not understand.  &amp;#8220;Our devices are based on life, on binding simple spirits to do our will,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prime Speaker blinked its eyes and fluttered its mouth a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Are there . . . more of you coming to this world?&amp;#8221; Galthas asked, and immediately winced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Subtle,&amp;#8221; Urjik muttered behind him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Of course not,&amp;#8221; the Prime Speaker replied.  &amp;#8220;As we said, we seek resources.  This is done in competition, as it should be.  Our location is secret of much seriousness.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;So the dead ships our scouts have spotted at the edge of this system are not yours?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Loban waved an arm dismissively.  &amp;#8220;No, no.  Not Loban.  Some other race whose name we do not recall.  They were seeking resources also, quite urgently.  But they did not know this orb was present.  They tried to turn back, make for another system.  Apparently they failed.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galthas felt something cold worm its way through his gut.  &amp;#8220;You knew they were in urgent need of resources?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Loban blinked.  &amp;#8220;Yes, yes.  We communicated with them briefly.  It yielded nothing.  It was of little importance.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Why didn&amp;#8217;t you direct them to this planet?&amp;#8221; Galthas asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Loban seemed taken aback; it blinked all of its eyes at once, three times.  &amp;#8220;We seek resources,&amp;#8221; it said.  &amp;#8220;This is done in competition.  All must compete for themselves alone, or the competition is impure.  These creatures were not Loban.  This orb was ours, found first by us.  Why would we want more competitors?&amp;#8221;  After a pause, it added, &amp;#8220;Of course, now that you are here, we anticipate striving for resources with you in the spirit of fairness.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Of course,&amp;#8221; Galthas said.  He turned to Urjik and said, &amp;#8220;Go back to our camp.  Tell Command the ships they found were not Loban.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urjik looked hesitant.  &amp;#8220;Go,&amp;#8221; Galthas told him, and he did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galthas contemplated the strange tripod-like alien.  Based on their brief interaction, he could not say that they might become bloodthirsty fanatics, like the Zayeen.  But they were incredibly indifferent, which might be just as bad.  The Loban&amp;#8217;s lack of compassion for the beings it had allowed to freeze to death was chilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He turned back to the Loban Speaker.  &amp;#8220;We accept your generous offer to compete for resources,&amp;#8221; he said.  &amp;#8220;And in return for your magnanimity, I wish to offer you the secret of our technology.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Galthas returned to camp, Urjik was nearly beside himself.  &amp;#8220;The Lobans!&amp;#8221; he said.  &amp;#8220;I pulled &amp;#8216;em up on the box &#8211; they got back in their ship and took off!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Did they, now?&amp;#8221; Galthas asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urjik pointed to the squawkbox.  An image of the Loban ship flying over the countryside hovered over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They&amp;#8217;re headed right for the sourcewell!&amp;#8221; Urjik said.  &amp;#8220;But how did they find it again?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Probably because I turned the ward off,&amp;#8221; Galthas said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Why would you . . .&amp;#8221; Urjik began.  But then he began to put it together, and fell silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they watched, the Loban ship hovered closer and closer to the sourcewell.  They crossed the edge of the clearing, and kept going, edging closer and closer.  The nose of their shuttle clipped the edge of the column of blazing light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sourcewell flared, and instantly engulfed the Loban ship.  It burned blue-green for a moment, and then returned to white, all impurities consumed.  There was no sign the Loban ship had ever existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Apparently they have somehow advanced this far with absolutely no knowledge of the dangers of sourcewells,&amp;#8221; Galthas said.  &amp;#8220;Who could have imagined?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urjik stared at him, wearing a look of dawning horror.  He had been in favor of attacking them openly, but not this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Bespeak the ship,&amp;#8221; Galthas said wearily.  &amp;#8220;Tell them the Loban expedition has met a tragic end.  Tell them there are no survivors.&amp;#8221; Tell them that from now on, nothing comes easy.  Tell them that out here it&amp;#8217;s every man for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell them this is &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; world now.  Why would we want more competitors?&lt;/p&gt;

PLANETFALL
by Michael C. Lea

Galthas Talisar stepped out from the buzzing chaos of the transportal and onto lush greenery.  This world was alien, to be sure, but the patterns were almost familiar.  The ship's oracles had chosen well.

Behind him, the transportal hummed again.  An armored leg emerged and carefully found its footing on the blue-green ferns carpeting the jungle floor.  More than twenty thousand miles above, the leg's owner shifted his weight and stepped fully through an identical transportal, instantly emerging on the planet's surface below.

That cautious step belonged to Urjik, who could be called cautious in few other ways.  In fact, his reputation had left him few other options for a willing partner on this mission.  Urjik did not care. He and Galthas had fought together against the worst the Zayeen had to offer.  He trusted Galthas implicitly, despite his disdain for the other scrawny ascetics from Signet Battalion.

Urjik's greenish skin and jutting lower canines marked him as a charuk, his bloodline tainted by nether influences.  Despite this stigma, and despite his temper, he had risen quickly in Rampart Battalion.  Even the most burdensome battlesuit did not slow him, and no one was a truer shot with an inferno cannon or a hex-impelled railgun.

Read More...


Galthas, by contrast, had the pale skin and slight build of the feytouched.  Unarmored and with no visible arms, he was nowhere near as physically imposing as Urjik.  Those who had seen Signet Battalion in action, however, knew that his bulky cold-iron armbands were weapons as formidable as any firearm or battleaxe, and far more versatile.

"Air's a little thick," Urjik said, "but it breathes."

"I could have told you that," Galthas replied softly, "since you insisted I go first."

Urjik flashed a tusky grin.  "I thought that was protocol," he said. "I always follow protocol."

Galthas frowned back over his shoulder at the armored charuk, but said nothing.  His companion was irrepressible, but Galthas had not quite recovered the use of his sense of humor yet.  It was one more thing the Zayeen had taken.  Perhaps here, on this world, they could find themselves again.

The transportal winked out behind them, the thaumaturgic sigil in its keystone deactivated from the other side.  No one else would be coming through.  For such a vital mission there would ordinarily be at least a full squadron, with clockwork or golems for logistical support. Here, as on dozens of other mission sites, there were only resources for a two-man team.

"Which way is it?" Urjik asked, looking around warily.  The air was warm and humid, and buzzed with strange insects like fat blue bees.

"We should be within twenty meters," Galthas said.  "This way, I think."

They moved through the brush, Galthas sliding quietly, Urjik with the subtlety of a tank.  His armor's servos whined as he plowed through flora and fauna alike.  The cluster of large multicolored crystals jutting from the center of the armor's back glowed as the suit drew power from them.

The undergrowth thinned.  A clearing lay just beyond.  They could feel a vibration in the aircedil; an indefinable high-energy presence, like a gathering thunderstorm.

Galthas turned back.  "Ready?" he asked.  "Either this is it, or this is something very bad."

Urjik hefted his high-powered Vindocladian inferno cannon to his shoulder and aimed its sigil-carved barrel into the clearing.  Inside the bulky rifle's main housing, a nether imp was caged, writhing in immortal fury but jacketed securely in heavy-duty curse-proofed lead.

"One of these days that thing's going to ba...</ns2:summary>

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hey Folks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick programming note: Escape Pod will be closed to submissions for the month of December. This is partly to get though a slight backlog of stories in the system now and also because as we get closer to the end of the pro-rate experiment we&amp;#8217;ve got some things to figure out.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never know how to end these things, so I&amp;#8217;ll steal from Mur and&#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be Mighty,&lt;br /&gt;

		<description>Have you written a story about The Timely Issue Of The Day? Will it still be timely by the time it's published? A writer can only hope.</description>
			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;About two years ago, I was flying with my family and I noticed that, when we landed, all I could hear was the sound of everyone&#8217;s cell phone booting up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month later, I had a 9000-word short-story about airport security. Taking place about 50 years in the future, it&#8217;s about a man traveling to Los Angeles to see his daughter and the rigmarole he has to go through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has yet to sell. I&#8217;ve cut down the word count, I&#8217;ve revised several times, I&#8217;ve sent it to a couple dozen publications&#8230; and no dice. No one seems to want it. (It almost made it to the top at &lt;em&gt;Andromeda Spaceways&lt;/em&gt;, and the readers gave me good feedback, but they didn&#8217;t publish it.) I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s not getting bought because nothing actually &lt;em&gt;happens&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8212; a man flies to Los Angeles to see his daughter &#8211; and editors I guess want stories where there&#8217;s action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&#8217;s neither here nor there. Not at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Monday, as I sat at my desk at work watching post after post about &lt;a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater&#8221;"&gt;security theater&lt;/a&gt; pass by on Tweetdeck, I felt a little spark of hope that my story might soon find a home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it often takes months for stories to get from the slush pile to the editorial desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that. I really do. And I&#8217;m very patient &#8211; I follow the submission guidelines to the best of my ability, I never bother editors unless the official response time has passed by more than a full week, and I don&#8217;t complain about form rejections. The reality of writing is that there&#8217;s a metric buttload of us and a relatively small number of editors and markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, now that I&#8217;ve exhausted most of the long-story markets, it&#8217;s going to be harder for me to find a home for my story. I predict a long couple of nights of rewriting, followed by sending out the story&#8230; and waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like every other burgeoning author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thing is, by the time my story gets to the top of the slush pile, the timeliness of it will probably be moot. All this hullabaloo about scanners that &lt;a href="//boingboing.net/2010/01/22/naked-airport-scanne.html&#8221;"&gt;don&#8217;t detect bombs in body cavities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="//gizmodo.com/5689759/tsa-full+body-scanners-protecting-passengers-or-padding-pockets&#8221;"&gt;scanners that show screeners your naked body&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="//lifehacker.com/5690402/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-tsa-screenings-and-gropings&#8221;"&gt;fines being levied against people who refuse to be body-scanned&lt;/a&gt; and don&#8217;t want your hands on their junk&#8230; it&#8217;ll all be over in three, six, nine, or 12 months (or whenever the story eventually is read by an editor who wants it). Then it&#8217;ll be another three to 18 months until it actually sees print. At that point, we&#8217;ll have moved onto another cause celebre. Twitter will be complaining about the next Apple tablet that doesn&#8217;t do That One Thing Everyone Likes, or a politician who said That One Thing Everyone Thought Was Idiotic, or the fact that people without That One Smartphone are technological luddites who don&#8217;t deserve to pray at the altars of their mighty cellphone providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;m okay with that. I really am. But it makes me wonder if I should mention in my cover letter that I wrote the story in response to airline security woes. Usually my cover letters are very simple: here is my story, I hope you like it and choose to publish it, thank you. (Soon they will include the location of my first professional publication, but until I have a contract in hand I&#8217;m not revealing it to a wider audience.) Would saying why I wrote a story help much? Would it give the slush reader the impetus to nudge it a little higher in the &#8220;stories for the editor to read&#8221; pile (provided the slush reader likes it enough to pass it on, of course)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m not an editor. But I do know this: regardless of what happens with the story I&#8217;ve just been blogging about, I&#8217;m going to keep writing timely fiction, and if it gets published too late&#8230; well, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll care, because it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; get published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;So, you like &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)" target="_blank"&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, huh? It&amp;#8217;s neat, right? An ongoing post-apocalyptic TV series about zombies, based on an award-winning comic. What&amp;#8217;s not to love? And fortunately, they&amp;#8217;ve done a mighty fine job on the adaptation. This viewer is pleased.&#160;Zombies are popular at the moment, cresting at the top of one of those unpredictable waves of fashion. &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt; has come at exactly the right time, whether by design or accident, and all power to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this series fits into another genre, that of the post-apocalyptic. And this is where I have a confession to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t like post-apocalyptic. Post-apocalyptic is predictable, formulaic, and easy. There, I&amp;#8217;ve said it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, not true. Post-apocalyptic is also hugely popular and always has been, not just with the general public but with discerning genre fans like you and I. It seems that wiping out humanity in some global catastrophe is something that, maybe, we all secretly wish for. I mean, if we were among the lucky survivors, it&amp;#8217;d be free reign, right? No work, no more need for money. No more cruelty and tyranny, no more pollution, overpopulation or war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course no people, no family, no friends, no loved ones, and the beginning of a huge struggle for survival against impossible odds in a situation likely to psychologically traumatise even the most hardened survivalist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So okay, not so neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said I don&amp;#8217;t like post-apocalyptic, and that bit &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; true. Post-apocalyptic is formulaic, simply because the scale of the situation is such that any fiction set after the disaster must follow similar plot lines. The survivors are isolated, and then eventually find each other. Cities are empty or full of the dead (or the walking dead). There is no power, no medicine. Every manmade resource is suddenly very finite indeed. And so on, and so on. Plotwise, most post-apocalyptic stories are more or less the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should point out here that I&amp;#8217;m no expert. I have friends who are very dedicated followers of end-of-the-world stories, and no doubt about now they&amp;#8217;re ready to put their keyboards through the computer screen in frustration. But hear me out. Post-apocalyptic may suck, plotwise, but where it really shines is in characterisation. Possibly more than any other genre, post-apocalyptic depends upon strong characterisation. Because if all the plots are the same, or similar (and I&amp;#8217;m talking pure plot here, which is different to story and situation), then all you have left are the survivors. And it is how the survivors act in their new environment that makes the story. I&amp;#8217;m not saying that characterisation is unique to the post-apocalypse, far from it, but I am saying that if you&amp;#8217;re about to write an epic tale of an empty world, you&amp;#8217;ve got to be prepared to engage the reader with some very, very powerful players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, and as a self-confessed post-apocalyptic skeptic, here&amp;#8217;s my list of five tales that, to me, are among the best examples of the post-apocalyptic. I&amp;#8217;m not just going to regurgitate a list from Wikipedia (and, my heavens, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction" target="_blank"&gt;there is quite a list on there&lt;/a&gt;), these are personal choices that I think are either great examples of either characterisation or perhaps an unusual or uncommon take on the post-apocalyptic plot. Having just slated the genre for being formulaic, let&amp;#8217;s see if there are any stories which break the mould.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I continue, there&amp;#8217;s also an important distinction to make here between those stories which are genuinely post-apocalyptic, and those which are really apocalyptic. Post-apocalypse, by definition, implies that the menace, threat, disaster, alien invasion, plague, etc, have been and gone. What we are left with is the world and the people left afterwards. Stories like the recent film &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyline_(film)" target="_blank"&gt;Skyline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_(film)"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, or great classics like &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_worlds" target="_blank"&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; take place while the disaster is unfolding. While the aftermath may be considered post-apocalyptic (although probably not in the case of &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;), we don&amp;#8217;t see that bit. I&amp;#8217;ll admit here I&amp;#8217;m going to cheat on one entry in my list below, but only because I think it&amp;#8217;s a particularly fine and relatively unknown example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Quiet Earth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/earth.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1511" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/earth.jpg" alt="" width="547" height="393" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#8217;m really sure how well known New Zealand cinema of the early 80s is outside of that country, but &lt;a href="http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/the-quiet-earth-1986-859" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Quiet Earth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is well worth tracking down. It tells the story of a man who wakes up one morning to find the world empty &#8722;&#160;whatever the apocalypse was (I shall reveal nothing), it actually physically removed the world&amp;#8217;s population, so our hero (played by the wonderful &lt;a href="http://www.nzonscreen.com/person/bruno-lawrence" target="_blank"&gt;Bruno Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;) finds himself genuinely alone. With a completely deserted Earth, not even a single corpse in sight, Lawrence carries the majority of the film on his own. It&amp;#8217;s a remarkable performance as his character goes from confusion, to exhilaration (with nobody around the world is his oyster&amp;#8230; if he wants to drive a giant earthmover through a gas station to see what happens, why not?) and finally to total paranoia and delusion. And after all, if you were the only human being left on the planet, wouldn&amp;#8217;t you start to think you were special? &lt;em&gt;The Quiet Earth&lt;/em&gt; is out on DVD and I&amp;#8217;d recommend you grab it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/The_Stand_cover.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1513" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/The_Stand_cover.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The grand-daddy of all post-apocalyptic stories, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stand" target="_blank"&gt;Stephen King&amp;#8217;s 1978&lt;/a&gt; tale of the survivors of a super flu which wipes out most of the human population is rightly considered a classic. At an eye-watering 1300 pages, this book is a perfect example of character over plot. Of course, King is known for this, but while the concept of a superflu (one engineered by the military as a biological weapon that is released accidentally) was old hat when King wrote it, the journey of the survivors as they find each other and come to terms with their new world is brilliant. Although the central plot eventually reveals itself &#8722;&#160;that of the survivor&amp;#8217;s journey to Las Vegas to make their stand against an evil that has arisen &#8722;&#160;how the characters react and cope is what makes this whopping tome a real page-turner. If you haven&amp;#8217;t read any King, this wouldn&amp;#8217;t be a bad place to start. Afficiandos think that this is his best work; while I personally prefer &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem's_Lot" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;#8216;Salem&amp;#8217;s Lot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, if you have any doubts about the post-apocalyptic genre, this will set your mind at rest, as it did mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earth Abides&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/eartha.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1515" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/eartha.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Twenty-nine years before &lt;em&gt;The Stand&lt;/em&gt; was published, academic George R. Stewart wrote his single novel which might be called &amp;#8220;genre&amp;#8221;. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Abides" target="_blank"&gt;Earth Abides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is another that follows the standard post-apocalyptic formula &#8722;&#160;a super-sickness kills everyone, leaving only those immune to the disease alive &#8722;&#160;but you can forgive Stewart for this given that it was probably a newer story concept back in the 1940s. &lt;em&gt;Earth Abides&lt;/em&gt; might be that one book that I&amp;#8217;d take to a desert island, should I be so abandoned. It&amp;#8217;s beautiful, moving and sad, and sticks in the mind not just because of the human characters and their journey but because of Stewart&amp;#8217;s depiction of the world itself. In &lt;em&gt;Earth Abides&lt;/em&gt;, the Earth itself is a character. Rid of destructive humans, it begins to regenerate, reclaiming itself and returning to an earlier pre-industrial (you might even say &amp;#8216;default&amp;#8217;) state. Stewart conveys this in a striking way, with a key motif being the silence of the world. Without humans and their cars, planes, factories and technology, the Earth is mostly silent, the loudest sound being that of a thunderclap. In this quiet Earth, the survivors gather and attempt to reconstruct society but ultimately they fail, instead regressing to a more primitive level of society. This only reinforces the central theme of the book. The Earth abides; humanity does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Road&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ctroad.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1518" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ctroad.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="362" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m cheating here. I&amp;#8217;m not talking about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road" target="_blank"&gt;Cormac McCarthy&amp;#8217;s Pulitzer Prize-winning post-apocalyptic novel&lt;/a&gt;, one which dominated the responses on Twitter when I put out a call for recommendations. I&amp;#8217;m talking about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatermass" target="_blank"&gt;Quatermass&lt;/a&gt; creator and master of British science fiction &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatermass" target="_blank"&gt;Nigel Kneale&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362094/" target="_blank"&gt;one-off BBC television drama from 1963&lt;/a&gt;, now sadly lost from the archives and only surviving in script form plus, it seems, one manky photo. Also, it&amp;#8217;s not really post-apocalyptic. In fact, it is really&lt;em&gt; pre-apocalyptic&lt;/em&gt;. In the 18th century, the inhabitants of an English village shun the road that runs through the nearby woods, for the woods are haunted and people have heard terrible things. As the story reaches the climax, it is revealed that the manifestations on the road are the echo of people fleeing an atomic explosion in the present day, somehow riverberating back in time. The juxtaposition of modern &#8722;&#160;police sirens, recognisably modern people running in abject terror for their lives &#8722;&#160;with the old, with the 18th century characters cowering in terror, completely unable to comprehend the sound which we, the viewer, recognise all too well, must have been both brilliant and chilling when it was first shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Survivors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/survivores.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1517" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/survivores.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I can&amp;#8217;t make this list, self-confessed archive television nut that I am, without mentioning Terry Nation&amp;#8217;s BBC TV series,&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivors" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Survivors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Again, the scenario is pure post-apocalypse cliche. Humanity is mostly wiped out by a plague, strongly implied to be deliberately engineered and released by accident. Over three seasons between 1975 and 1979, &lt;em&gt;Survivors&lt;/em&gt; charted the journey of the survivors as they found each other and ultimately formed a community. Critics often bemoan the transformation from gritty science fiction survival story to &amp;#8220;soap opera&amp;#8221;, but I think they&amp;#8217;re confusing soap opera with character-driven drama, and this is where Survivors shows its real strength (characterisation, see?). &lt;em&gt;Survivors&lt;/em&gt; was remade for a modern audience over two seasons in 2008 and 2010, but here the tired nature of the premise was in full effect, rendering the remake flat and pointless. &lt;em&gt;Survivors&lt;/em&gt; should be experienced in all its 70s glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/invasion.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1519" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/invasion.jpg" alt="" width="504" height="314" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sixth entry, mainly because Nigel Kneale&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;The Road&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t quite count. &lt;em&gt;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&lt;/em&gt; was the second appearance of the Daleks in &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt;, and was broadcast in six episodes from November 21 to December 26, 1964. Despite the title, this isn&amp;#8217;t about an alien invasion. By the time the Doctor and company arrive in a deserted, dilapidated London, the Daleks have been the masters of the Earth for a decade or more. Here we discover that the Daleks first employed a virus to weaken society before arriving in force, and years late the surviving humans are either enslaved or gathered in disparate resistance groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8216;s first foray into alien invasion and one of the rare&#160;occasions&#160;it featured a genuinely post-apocalyptic story. Extensive location work around London makes this story something of a small-screen epic, and to this day it is regarded as one of the best stories of the show&amp;#8217;s early years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many more that are worth of this list &#8722;&#160;as already mentioned, &lt;em&gt;The Road&lt;/em&gt; by Cormac McCarthy, but also &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall-e" target="_blank"&gt;Wall-E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://theclockworkcentury.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Boneshaker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Cherie Priest (perhaps a rare example of post-apocalyptic confined to a very specific place, namely the walled city of Seattle). UK genre publisher &lt;a href="http://www.abaddonbooks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Abaddon&lt;/a&gt; has a entire ongoing post-apocalyptic series, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.abaddonbooks.com/titles/" target="_blank"&gt;The Afterblight Chronicles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which are well worth checking out. Like I said I&amp;#8217;m not post-apocalyptic scholar so please, nominate your own prime examples of the genre in the comments and teach me a lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you&amp;#8217;ll excuse me, I have the next episode of &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt; to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
By Genevieve Valentine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first day of fifth year a boy came in with the new eyeshields, a glossy expanse of black with no iris or pupil, and looking at him was like looking into an eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the other girls said it made them uncomfortable; they teased him to take them out, to put on some normal sunglasses like everyone else. They said they&amp;#8217;d never forgive him for hiding eyes in such a handsome face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Fortuni, it&amp;#8217;s a little much,&amp;#8221; said someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was how I learned his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were all Level Two intelligence, but before the first week was over the news was out that some had managed to find the money for a sixth year. Janik Duranti, who spent the history lectures drawing stick figures screwing on his computer screen, was getting a sixth year. I&amp;#8217;d be cleaning his office someday. Answering his phones. Updating the registration on his blue ID cuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carol Clarke opened the top button on her shirt as soon as the shades went down; obvious, but it was worth it to be married to a guy who had a sixth year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time Fortuni opened his mouth was two weeks after start-of-year in geohistory, when Mr. Xi was talking about the five oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;After the emergency desalinization,&amp;#8221; Mr. Xi said, &amp;#8220;we held the first HydroSummit to determine the best use of resources.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I think it&amp;#8217;s awful about the dolphins that died,&amp;#8221; said Kay, whose water ration was unlimited because her father was a diplomat, and that was how I first noticed her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Xi opened the rain cycle diagram on our screens; the blue advection loop from a hundred years ago had been overlaid by a three-point process from the Atmo water collectors to the thirsty ground, and the green web of the surface sweat system that preserved the little underground things that managed to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandfather sent my mom a postcard from Niagara Cliffs when there was still a river at the bottom (&lt;em&gt;RAIN! All my love, Dad&lt;/em&gt;), and as Mr. Xi talked about desalinization I traced the advection circle, thought about the sky filling with wet clouds, about water sliding over everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked up, and Fortuni was watching me, his lashes casting shadows over his flat black eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m going to engineer some rain,&amp;#8221; he told me, and after a moment I laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was how I met him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://escapepod.org/2010/11/25/advection/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more&amp;#8230;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-1522"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was nearly the end of year when I walked past the upper-class apartments and saw the plant in the garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart leapt into my throat, and I checked to see if a cop was recording me, because nobody just left a clipping on the street. But besides the tram down the street full of commuters, there was nobody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knelt and stared at the glossy tops, the browned underside where it was drying out, the pale hairs on the stem. Even from this distance the smell was overwhelming, wet and clean, and without caring if the cops were watching I scooped it up and dropped it into the back of my hood where it would be safest from the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tram home was endless; I felt the stem pressing against my neck and shivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half a day&amp;#8217;s water ration went into a glass bowl, and I looked up what plant it was (jade) and how much water it would need (hardly any. It was a survivor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat up all night watching the pattern of leaves on the walls. I expected it to die; I cried like I&amp;#8217;d already lost it, ended up dehydrated from tears and lack of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Fortuni walked with me after school the next day I didn&amp;#8217;t ask why. I was making up my mind to show him the plant. My heart raced. He could turn me in. I didn&amp;#8217;t really know him. It was too dangerous. I couldn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Come with me,&amp;#8221; I said, and he got in the tram without asking why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before I opened the door I hadn&amp;#8217;t wondered why he walked me home, and when he smiled at the plant and said, &amp;#8220;Beautiful,&amp;#8221; I knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wasn&amp;#8217;t a Level Two. Everybody else was a fool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He lifted his hand to the glass, closed his eyes over the black shields. He smiled like he knew he looked silly, or like the plant told him a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The water is cool,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I keep it under my bed at night.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He opened one eye, grinned at me. &amp;#8220;Hiding it from your parents or trying for condensation?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a moment he took his hand off the glass and went home without another word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day he messaged: &lt;em&gt;How is it? Dream about it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stronger&lt;/em&gt;, I messaged back, didn&amp;#8217;t tell him what I dreamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At school we didn&amp;#8217;t talk about it&#8212;we didn&amp;#8217;t talk at all, because I had to work to pass exams, and he had to work to avoid tripping over girls who couldn&amp;#8217;t get enough of his bone-white skin and his blue cuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kay ignored him. She sat one row in front of him in classes, and when he asked her a question she turned just enough to give him her profile, answered him curtly, turned back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This winter I&amp;#8217;m going to my uncle&amp;#8217;s farm,&amp;#8221; she told Carol. &amp;#8220;He&amp;#8217;s scheduled an Atmo so we can get rain.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Oh, wow,&amp;#8221; breathed Carol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My pen snapped, and I had to wait until end of class to get another one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Xi talked about the Reclaimers and the class got into a screaming match about whether they were terrorists or guerrillas. They yelled about the cave communities who harbored the sleeper cells; about whether wild rain was even a good idea any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s a waste of water,&amp;#8221; said Janik, and I wanted to kick him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I looked over at Fortuni, he was gazing unblinking ahead of him, his eyes fixed on the knot of hair at the nape of Kay&amp;#8217;s neck, on her pale hand writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t hear the rest of the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortuni messaged: &lt;em&gt;What do you think of Kay?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Try.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant was outgrowing the bowl, and I adjusted the stem, didn&amp;#8217;t get around to answering him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day in geohistory Mr. Xi talked about Free Water, about the cave-towns authorized to collect condensation without reporting. The class got into it again about Reclaimers seeking asylum there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at the cliffs and thought how they were underwater once, about vegetation breathing into the sky, about water so big you couldn&amp;#8217;t see the end of it, about the wet slide of rain across skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s weird when you miss rain you&amp;#8217;ve never felt,&amp;#8221; Fortuni said, like I&amp;#8217;d spoken, and my fingers went cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I know,&amp;#8221; I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked back at Kay, who had turned a little towards him as if by accident, resting a white hand on her throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got home he&amp;#8217;d messaged me. &lt;em&gt;Clip it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t think about Fortuni when the side-by-side clippings grew so fast; all I knew was my dreams filled with the creaky, quiet sound of growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer. The last day of fifth year Fortuni wasn&amp;#8217;t there. I didn&amp;#8217;t really think about it (he was Level Zero) except that Kay looked nervous, and it worried me that if something was wrong with Fortuni, Kay knew more than I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped her as she was walking back to her seat with her certificate, said, &amp;#8220;Have you seen&#8212;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She pulled away from me like she was poisoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carol laughed, and I hoped she had to marry Janick Duranti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the tram on the way home someone came up behind me, said in my ear, &amp;#8220;Figured out rain yet?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Fortuni&amp;#8217;s voice, and I was so relieved that I must have really been worried before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned, but he was wearing a black UV hood and I couldn&amp;#8217;t see his face. It had a white bird outline on the side, and as I tried to find his profile behind the hood the silhouette took flight, wings beating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hood was from the bargain market, standard SPF 150 striped brown and purple, and I&amp;#8217;d never wanted to be rich so much in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You weren&amp;#8217;t in class,&amp;#8221; I said. &amp;#8220;Tapped for Level Zero?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked at me like he couldn&amp;#8217;t help it, and for the first time I thought that maybe I&amp;#8217;d managed to surprise him. &amp;#8220;You think I&amp;#8217;m special?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t answer that, and he grinned, shrugged. &amp;#8220;Yeah, I wish. Just got held up with something.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the tram ride he looked out the window, and I watched the bird flying on the taut black fabric between two of the ribs; when he put his hood back, the bird would disappear into the folds. It seemed really sad. I don&amp;#8217;t know why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my stop, I got off without asking him to follow me, and he took one step and changed his mind, gave me a half-wave as the tram pulled away from the stop and back onto the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At home I slid it out from under my bed so it could breathe for an hour. It was big enough to be illegal; I was a criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I messaged him. &lt;em&gt;You should see it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words sat on my screen, and he didn&amp;#8217;t answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autumn. One of the big government offices was hiring, and I got my credentials and made coffee and shuttled lunches and watched sixth-years plan trajectories and irrigation patterns and wildlife preservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made sure my plant had enough water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winter. The dreams about Niagara Cliffs and the water cycle never stopped, and I applied for a sixth year without telling anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring. I went into one of the banks in my nice suit and folded back the expensive UV hood I borrowed from a nice sixth-year at the office, and arranged to go into a decade of debt for a year of Meteohydronics and a chance at a seat on an Atmo. My parents were surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer. It was too big for the bowl, and I had to leave clippings on the sill with the shade cracked, five minutes at a time until the sun shriveled them and they were dry enough to burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A message came back from Fortuni.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want to go to a concert?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It had been a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I waited outside the back entrance of Roseland I couldn&amp;#8217;t think of anything but Fortuni&amp;#8217;s UV hood, black with a white bird silhouette that flew in place as you watched. I pressed against the grimy brick to avoid the swells of tourists sweating in their &amp;#8220;NYC&amp;#8221; rental hoods, and my breath fluttered in my chest as I looked for Fortuni in a sea of strangers. My hands were clammy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I saw him, bouncing along next to that little white bird was Kay&amp;#8217;s pale blue hood with her coat of arms on each side&#8212;two greyhounds and a pile of helmets and swords. Kay must have just finished her sixth year, because as the crowd parted for her (crowds always did) I could see she carried nothing except a smug expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sucked in a sigh, and felt dust coating the inside of my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Sarah, hi!&amp;#8221; Kay stepped under the marquee and pushed back the hood, shook out her long blonde hair. She&amp;#8217;d gotten a grey wash in between exams&#8212;the latest thing to make you look paler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made fists in my pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Fortuni pushed his hood back, the white bird spread its wings into the folds. &amp;#8220;Did we keep you waiting?&amp;#8221; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Of course not,&amp;#8221; said Kay. &amp;#8220;She doesn&amp;#8217;t have to worry about studying any more.&amp;#8221; She grinned. &amp;#8220;You must be so relieved that&amp;#8217;s all over.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We should go inside,&amp;#8221; said Fortuni, and opened the back door. For a moment Kay looked disgusted by the shabby welcome, but she went. It was Fortuni, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music was already throbbing as we approached the bar, and Kay gave Fortuni a look of delight. Her hood was too big for her; folded down against her back it made her look like a crested lizard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She brought him a glass. He passed it to me, and she had to go back for another one and look like it didn&amp;#8217;t bother her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This band is totally derivative,&amp;#8221; she told Fortuni, who had hung back with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He shrugged. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s the opening act. I didn&amp;#8217;t pay much attention to the bill.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was just like Fortuni to go to a concert without even knowing what band it was, and so I didn&amp;#8217;t think much of it. He just liked to stand in the crowd, eyes closed, feeling the breath of two hundred people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve never felt lonelier than when I was standing next to Fortuni in a crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Well, I figured you had better taste than that. I hear Hammond is amazing.&amp;#8221; Kay swung back and forth between baiting and appeasing Fortuni so quickly I thought she&amp;#8217;d get whiplash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If you can hear anything around that stupid hood,&amp;#8221; I said under my breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortuni smiled into his glass, and his laugh, if he laughed, was drowned out by screams and applause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kay flirted with the bartender through two more free drinks, glancing backs at Fortuni to make sure it was all right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;ve applied for a sixth year,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He knew it the way he knew everything, and I didn&amp;#8217;t bother to answer him. I&amp;#8217;d requested a year in Meteohydronics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;So,&amp;#8221; I said, &amp;#8220;are you and Kay dating?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He smiled, still not looking at me. &amp;#8220;Nah. We just talk.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about green leaves spilling over the edge of the bowl. &amp;#8220;What about?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;She has ambition,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s not something you run across often.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ambition was her as the pretty shadow of some boy, and I saw that ambition all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t really feel like a concert.&amp;#8221; I pressed my drink into his hand. &amp;#8220;I need to study. See you.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;No,&amp;#8221; he said, stepped forward. &amp;#8220;Please, stay. Please.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had his hand on my arm, the first time he&amp;#8217;d ever touched me. I looked up and could see past the eyeshields into green, frightened eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#8217;d never asked me for anything, not one thing that whole silent year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Okay,&amp;#8221; I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He smiled as if he&amp;#8217;d never doubted, and I wondered if I&amp;#8217;d just imagined that I could see through him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kay materialized at his side, smiling, but her hand was wrapped around her glass so hard that the skin under her nails was red. &amp;#8220;Sorry,&amp;#8221; she said. &amp;#8220;Am I interrupting? Hammond was announced, but if you want to be alone&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortuni dropped his hand. My arm was cold where he&amp;#8217;d touched it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The band was loud, and when Fortuni leaned over and spoke he had to repeat himself, louder, before I heard him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Come with me,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart constricted. &amp;#8220;What?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You and Kay,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;Come with me.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Where are you going?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He half-smiled. &amp;#8220;To engineer some rain.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought, Reclaimers, but didn&amp;#8217;t dare say it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about his fingers on the glass bowl as he listened to the plant growing, thought maybe he didn&amp;#8217;t even need the Reclaimers to make rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My lungs pounded against my ribs. &amp;#8220;Me?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I want you with me for the first wild rain.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know why he could still surprise me, but he could; he was a wondrous thing, and back then I was easy to surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;And Kay?&amp;#8221; I asked, because I was afraid, and it sounded like a spurned child asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, &amp;#8220;Come with me.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had signed up for a sixth year. I wanted to work with the Atmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a plant that would die without me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Fortuni&amp;#8217;s black eyes the reflection of the crowd was like wet clouds gathering, like the dream of rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music washed over us, and I was half-dreaming about walking beside Fortuni, walking into some other unknown life that was full of water, and without Kay&amp;#8217;s white bracelet lighting up a warning we wouldn&amp;#8217;t have known the police were coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kay moved first (she must have been used to getting out of something right before the cops got in), and shoved us towards the stairs, shouting something that was drowned out by the drums and the bass. As much as I distrusted her I ran, and beside me Fortuni ran, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we took the turn on the landing I caught a glimpse of her in the crowd, swaying to the music like she didn&amp;#8217;t know us at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the top of the stairs I saw the EXIT sign and ducked into the utility hall pulling Fortuni behind me; he crouched and slid along the wall, and I followed his lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They&amp;#8217;re not after your plant,&amp;#8221; he said, which was the first time I thought they might have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What were you doing all year?&amp;#8221; I imagined him in a cave, drinking condensation, blowing up reservoirs, blowing up Atmos with people like me in them. My voice shook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He turned and grinned. &amp;#8220;Engineering some rain,&amp;#8221; he said, and as we heard footsteps echoing in the stairwell he held out a hand, said, &amp;#8220;Come with me.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We couldn&amp;#8217;t make it to the fire exit before the cops got there, and he was holding out his hand, and I didn&amp;#8217;t understand what he was saying, what he was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hesitated, shook my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He turned and ducked into the door on his right; I saw a cluster of rooms before the door swung shut behind him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I moved to follow, the cops swarmed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They weren&amp;#8217;t all cops, some of them were kids drinking over-ration who got spooked and bolted, but it felt like a sea of uniforms and I covered my head to protect myself from the kicks, and I let myself be yanked up and handcuffed, listened for Fortuni to make his big escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#8217;t. They stormed the dressing room (I bit my lips until they bled), someone shouted, the bang of a gunshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had to drag me out by the cuffs because I was trying to run into the room, to see what had happened, to see them carry out his body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard, &amp;#8220;&#8212;nothing left!&amp;#8221; just before the door swung shut and they yanked me down the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought of the little white bird, of the folds in his hood, how something could be so neatly tucked away. I stumbled. My eyes burned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kay was outside, talking to the cop with the most brass on. As I walked past them, Kay laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Her? Oh please. No way she&amp;#8217;s over ration. Can&amp;#8217;t afford anything.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Kay stared at me like I knew something she didn&amp;#8217;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew he had gone into the dressing room, and there was one shot&#8212;but maybe he was out by then, maybe he ran, he looked like a sprinter&#8212;and he would have run with me, taken me with him, but there was the shot, but even when his hood was folded back, and even when you couldn&amp;#8217;t see it the little white bird was flying away and away and away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He would have taken me with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kay looked sick and turned away, and I wondered if he had leaned in over the music and asked her to come with him, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They still play music there, not that anybody can get tickets unless they&amp;#8217;re willing to sit under the stage, and when my big brother did that for Goblin Dust he almost failed his service physical six weeks later because he couldn&amp;#8217;t hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top of the balcony stairs is dark and quiet&#8212;everyone goes for the view over the railing, no one even sees the hall behind the utility door. Baby-blue walls, like Kay&amp;#8217;s hood, and two dressing rooms&#8212;one an inch deep in grime, makeup mirrors with all but two lights burned out, a pinball table rusted stiff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second door opens to a honeycomb of little rooms, cloth tacked to the walls, carpet crunching underfoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there was ever an escape it&amp;#8217;s not there now, and I ram the walls until my shoulder wrenches in the socket, tear down the fabric and check for hidden doors, and I fall to my knees and drag my fingers along the floor looking for a crack that will open the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to apply at the Embassy to see anyone privately, even if you can recognize Ambassador Arnaun&amp;#8217;s crest in a sea of hoods, even if his daughter called the cops off you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a paper form, and if it&amp;#8217;s not the Ambassador you want to see, then you write the person&amp;#8217;s name in a little box underneath, and in the box below that you fill out the reason for your visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write, &lt;em&gt;Accepted into sixth year. Advice?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A guard directs me to the proper line, and I stand between Visas and Water Permits, and some woman stamps my paper and tells me to look for a response in my email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes six weeks, and then the image of my form is sent back so I can see that under ENTERED it has been stamped DECLINED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I end up looking up the social calendar for her kind of people, and a week later I find her outside a club, smoking, bare-armed in the cold to show off the big white smoking permit on her wrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she sees me she licks her lips, turns her profile to me like she used to do with Fortuni.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Declined,&amp;#8221; she says when I&amp;#8217;m close enough. &amp;#8220;Have they not gotten to long words in sixth year yet?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say, &amp;#8220;Do you know where he is?&amp;#8221; which I mean to say, and &amp;#8220;I miss him,&amp;#8221; which I don&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says, &amp;#8220;Well, I don&amp;#8217;t know, do I?&amp;#8221; which I expect, and bursts into tears, which I don&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I go home and look up her life until then, little mentions on the society sites and on the galleries of the most fashionable people, and I feel like I&amp;#8217;m checking up on someone I used to babysit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get another message from the Embassy, which I expect, and accept the invitation, which I don&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At night I pull the bowl out from under my bed and press my hands to the glass, feel with my palms for the voices of living things. When I sit back, the beads are already condensing, two handprints full of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m going to engineer some rain,&amp;#8221; he told me, and I dream of him standing on the dry seabed, closing his eyes over black shields, spreading his arms, opening the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

Advection
By Genevieve Valentine

The first day of fifth year a boy came in with the new eyeshields, a glossy expanse of black with no iris or pupil, and looking at him was like looking into an eclipse.

All the other girls said it made them uncomfortable; they teased him to take them out, to put on some normal sunglasses like everyone else. They said they'd never forgive him for hiding eyes in such a handsome face.

"Fortuni, it's a little much," said someone.

That was how I learned his name.

We were all Level Two intelligence, but before the first week was over the news was out that some had managed to find the money for a sixth year. Janik Duranti, who spent the history lectures drawing stick figures screwing on his computer screen, was getting a sixth year. I'd be cleaning his office someday. Answering his phones. Updating the registration on his blue ID cuff.

Carol Clarke opened the top button on her shirt as soon as the shades went down; obvious, but it was worth it to be married to a guy who had a sixth year.

The first time Fortuni opened his mouth was two weeks after start-of-year in geohistory, when Mr. Xi was talking about the five oceans.

"After the emergency desalinization," Mr. Xi said, "we held the first HydroSummit to determine the best use of resources."

"I think it's awful about the dolphins that died," said Kay, whose water ration was unlimited because her father was a diplomat, and that was how I first noticed her.

Mr. Xi opened the rain cycle diagram on our screens; the blue advection loop from a hundred years ago had been overlaid by a three-point process from the Atmo water collectors to the thirsty ground, and the green web of the surface sweat system that preserved the little underground things that managed to survive.

My grandfather sent my mom a postcard from Niagara Cliffs when there was still a river at the bottom (RAIN! All my love, Dad), and as Mr. Xi talked about desalinization I traced the advection circle, thought about the sky filling with wet clouds, about water sliding over everything.

I looked up, and Fortuni was watching me, his lashes casting shadows over his flat black eyes.

"I'm going to engineer some rain," he told me, and after a moment I laughed.

That was how I met him.

It was nearly the end of year when I walked past the upper-class apartments and saw the plant in the garbage.

My heart leapt into my throat, and I checked to see if a cop was recording me, because nobody just left a clipping on the street. But besides the tram down the street full of commuters, there was nobody.

I knelt and stared at the glossy tops, the browned underside where it was drying out, the pale hairs on the stem. Even from this distance the smell was overwhelming, wet and clean, and without caring if the cops were watching I scooped it up and dropped it into the back of my hood where it would be safest from the sun.

The tram home was endless; I felt the stem pressing against my neck and shivered.

Half a day's water ration went into a glass bowl, and I looked up what plant it was (jade) and how much water it would need (hardly any. It was a survivor).

I sat up all night watching the pattern of leaves on the walls. I expected it to die; I cried like I'd already lost it, ended up dehydrated from tears and lack of water.

When Fortuni walked with me after school the next day I didn't ask why. I was making up my mind to show him the plant. My heart raced. He could turn me in. I didn't really know him. It was too dangerous. I couldn't.

"Come with me," I said, and he got in the tram without asking why.

			<ns4:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We at Escape Pod have been thrilled and gratified at the response for the first Soundproof Escape Pod. We got kudos for everything from the fact that it existed, to the awesome layout job by our own Bill Peters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Bill, this month I want to announce our staff changes. Escape Pod is hitting its stride now, thanks mostly to our new assistant editor. We promoted Bill Peters from the inside joke of Assistant to the Regional Manager, or the Right A.R.M., to Assistant Editor. He wrangles the slush and makes sure I am on top of things, and I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;d be without him. We&#8217;re also delighted to welcome Mat Weller on as our audio producer. If you listen to Escape Pod, you&#8217;ll notice that Norm Sherman of the Drabblecast (a fine, award-winning podcast you should totally listen to) is still a part-time host, who, incidentally, makes me work harder on my intros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of slush, in order to get a hold of the reins of this mighty team of slush ponies, we&#8217;re closing to submissions over December. We&#8217;ll be back on the job in January, once the hangovers fade.&lt;/p&gt;

		<ns2:summary>We at Escape Pod have been thrilled and gratified at the response for the first Soundproof Escape Pod. We got kudos for everything from the fact that it existed, to the awesome layout job by our own Bill Peters.

Speaking of Bill, this month I want to announce our staff changes. Escape Pod is hitting its stride now, thanks mostly to our new assistant editor. We promoted Bill Peters from the inside joke of Assistant to the Regional Manager, or the Right A.R.M., to Assistant Editor. He wrangles the slush and makes sure I am on top of things, and I donrsquo;t know where Irsquo;d be without him. Wersquo;re also delighted to welcome Mat Weller on as our audio producer. If you listen to Escape Pod, yoursquo;ll notice that Norm Sherman of the Drabblecast (a fine, award-winning podcast you should totally listen to) is still a part-time host, who, incidentally, makes me work harder on my intros.

Speaking of slush, in order to get a hold of the reins of this mighty team of slush ponies, wersquo;re closing to submissions over December. Wersquo;ll be back on the job in January, once the hangovers fade.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#201;lan Vital&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
By K. Tempest Bradford&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The few minutes I had to spend in the Institute&amp;#8217;s waiting room were my least favorite part of coming up to visit my mother.  It felt more like a dialysis room, the visitors sunk into the overly-soft couches and not speaking, just drinking orange juice and recovering.  There were no magazines and no television, just cold air blowing from the vents and generic music flowing with it.  I&amp;#8217;d finished my juice and was beginning to brood on my dislike for overly air-conditioned buildings when my mother arrived attended by a nurse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kissed and hugged her, automatically asking how she was, mouthing the answer she always gave as she gave it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m fine, same as always.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#8217;t strictly true, but true enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://escapepod.org/2010/12/02/ep269-elan-vital/"&gt;Read More&amp;#8230;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-1570"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Let&amp;#8217;s go on out,&amp;#8221; she said, shrugging off the nurse&amp;#8217;s continued assistance.  &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s too cold in here.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the hint, the nurse tried to help Mom over the threshold.  As always, she rebuffed any attempt to treat her like an old person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Where to today?&amp;#8221; she asked, slipping her arm into mine as we escaped the frigid building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Just down to the lake,&amp;#8221; I said.  &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t want to overexert you.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She squeezed my arm as her feet slid carefully over the cobbled path. I wanted her to use a wheelchair, or a walker, at least.  She wouldn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What you mean is that we haven&amp;#8217;t got so much time today,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shrugged instead of answering.  I didn&amp;#8217;t want to go into why I couldn&amp;#8217;t afford much this trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Next time I&amp;#8217;ll come for a couple of days, at least.  I promise.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;No, that&amp;#8217;s all right,&amp;#8221; she said.  &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t like it when you spend so much for days and more.  A few hours is fine.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I helped her past the immaculately landscaped gardens and small orchards.  The scent of flowers, herbs, and fresh-cut grass wafting at us in turn.  I glanced at the garden entrances as we passed by, catching quick glances of other people in the middle of visits.  A young couple who&amp;#8217;d been in the waiting room with me knelt by a small, bald girl as she splashed in the koi pond.  Two elderly women stood under a weeping willow, their heads close, lips barely moving.  A large group of people speaking Mandarin milled around the waterfall in the rock garden.  I could still hear faint traces of their melodic din all the way down by the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I preferred this spot&amp;#8211;the flora was less regimented and more natural. And no walls.  Just an open space, water gently flicking the shoreline, a beautiful view down the hill, and the occasional cat wandering by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This hasn&amp;#8217;t changed much,&amp;#8221; my mom said as I helped her down on one of the small benches by the water.  &amp;#8220;I thought they were going to get ducks or geese or something.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose a nearby rock for my own perch.  &amp;#8220;I think they&amp;#8217;re having trouble with permits or whatever you need nowadays.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wind kicked up, sending freckles of reflected light across her face.  Her skin was still perfect, beautiful and dark brown, though stretched across her cheekbones a little too tight.  I hated that I never had enough to restore her round cheeks and full figure.  I have to look at pictures just to remember her that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You haven&amp;#8217;t changed much, either,&amp;#8221; she said while fussing with my hair.  I&amp;#8217;d bought some dye the week before, knowing she&amp;#8217;d notice it. &amp;#8220;How long has it been?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Three months.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She let out a familiar sigh&amp;#8211;part exhaustion, part exasperation, part sadness, I suppose.  &amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s too soon.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s your birthday, though.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Is it?  It&amp;#8217;s fall already?&amp;#8221;  She looked out over the small forest that edged the Institute&amp;#8217;s boundary a few miles away.  The trees were still green with no hint of turning.  It always felt and looked like summer there; one of the reasons the administrators chose the location.  &amp;#8220;I miss the seasons.  Fall colors, Christmas snow&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You never did when you had to shovel it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That got her to smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached out and held her hand; still a little cold even in the full sunlight.  &amp;#8220;Besides, I missed you.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I know.  But&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;And I won&amp;#8217;t be able to come back until after the new year, anyway, so I wanted to squeeze in one more visit.  Since today is special&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago I used to bring her cake and presents on her birthday.  She couldn&amp;#8217;t really eat the cake&amp;#8211;one of the side effects of whatever they did when they brought her back.  The presents had to go back home with me since she didn&amp;#8217;t have any place to put them and couldn&amp;#8217;t wear clothing or jewelry once she went back to sleep.  I hated having to give that up, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Okay, I&amp;#8217;ll give you a pass this time.&amp;#8221;  She kissed my cheek, seeming more like her old self.  &amp;#8220;Where are you off to?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Rwanda.  For a dig.  Dr. Berman promised I&amp;#8217;d be more than a glorified volunteer wrangler this trip.  And they want me for a year.  Still, I&amp;#8217;ll try to come back and see you sooner than that.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;No, you should concentrate on your work.  I&amp;#8217;ll still be here.&amp;#8221;  My mother never changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the same when she was sick.  I wanted to take a break from college and stay home with her.  It was pretty clear that her death was inevitable by that time, the only question being: how long?  I wanted to be with her, she wanted me back in class.  &lt;em&gt;If you take a leave of absence you might never go back, &lt;/em&gt;she&amp;#8217;d said.  So I went back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;For me it&amp;#8217;ll seem like you&amp;#8217;ve gone and come back right away.&amp;#8221;  Trying to reassure me again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I know,&amp;#8221; I said.  &amp;#8220;Must be strange, not being able to perceive the passage of time.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#8217;t say anything for a while.  This was the part of the visit where one of us either addressed the elephant in the room or steered the conversation around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;At least I&amp;#8217;m not as bad as Ella,&amp;#8221; she said.  And we both laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My aunt, her older sister, was so notorious for being late that we started her funeral a few hours behind schedule because it just felt right.  My cousin Brandon joked that we should have carved an epitaph on her headstone: &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll be back in five minutes.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Remember the time she was supposed to pick me up from rehearsal or something?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;And you waited for her, caught the bus, and was home before she&amp;#8217;d even left the house!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mom kept me laughing for a long time, recounting trips she&amp;#8217;d taken with Ella and their cousins and everything that went wrong because they were never on time anywhere.  Stories I&amp;#8217;d heard dozens of times before and wouldn&amp;#8217;t have minded hearing a hundred times again.  More and more, her laughs ended with a small coughing fit.  I checked the time; we had about forty-five minutes left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Do you want to head back?&amp;#8221; I asked.  &amp;#8220;Sit inside a bit before you&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Die?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You don&amp;#8217;t die.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Technically, I do.  According to the doctors, anyway.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t argue.  I didn&amp;#8217;t even want to be talking about it.  I was never there when my mother went &amp;#8216;back under&amp;#8217;, as the nurses put it. It was against Institute rules.  I suppose for some people it might have been upsetting to see their loved ones in the capsules residents stayed in.  Too much like a coffin.  For me, it felt wrong not to be by her side when it happened.  I was with her when she first died, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing that I wasn&amp;#8217;t going to go there, mom leaned back and turned her face to the sunlight.  &amp;#8220;No, let&amp;#8217;s stay out here a little bit longer. It&amp;#8217;s a nice day.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I could come back tomorrow, get a few more hours,&amp;#8221; I said.  It wouldn&amp;#8217;t matter if I stayed a little longer.  There wasn&amp;#8217;t anyone waiting for me back at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You know how I feel about that.&amp;#8221;  Her look was semi-stern.  &amp;#8220;You don&amp;#8217;t want to end up in here yourself.  Not for a long time, if ever.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;At least we&amp;#8217;d be together,&amp;#8221; I said, smiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;But who would bring us back?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m sure I could bribe Brandon&amp;#8217;s kids to do it.&amp;#8221;  I wasn&amp;#8217;t particularly close to my cousin anymore, though his oldest called me on the holidays.  My guess was she&amp;#8217;d been coveting my share of our grandmother&amp;#8217;s house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;ve given this a lot of thought.  I&amp;#8217;m surprised.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew I had to tread very carefully.  &amp;#8220;It may come up.  Someday.  You haven&amp;#8217;t said you want to stop.  And if anything happens to me, it&amp;#8217;s in my will that I want to come here if I can.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mom gazed at me steadily for what felt like a long time.  &amp;#8220;Are you sure that&amp;#8217;s what you want?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That alarmed me more than a little.  &amp;#8220;Why?  Is there&amp;#8230; I mean, something that isn&amp;#8217;t right?  Is it&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;  When you avoid talking about something for so long, it&amp;#8217;s hard to know how to start.  &amp;#8220;Is it bad?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The dying?  I don&amp;#8217;t know, really.  They always induce sleep before that moment.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I had always been more reluctant to talk about this, I could tell my mother was holding back, not saying some things.  That scared me even more.  She was always very upfront with me except when it came to what was going on with her.  Usually when it was really bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s it like?  Afterwards.  While you&amp;#8217;re&amp;#8230; gone.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She shook her head slowly, her look far away.  &amp;#8220;To be honest, I don&amp;#8217;t know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better than the answer I&amp;#8217;d been dreading.  Answers, plural, actually. Nothing I could imagine made me feel particularly good.  Either I was ripping my mother away from the glories of heaven or giving her only small respites from the tortures of hell.  The preachers and protestors all had their own variations on those themes and loved to scream them at me (or anyone else driving past the gates) whenever I came up.  &amp;#8216;I don&amp;#8217;t know&amp;#8217; was, at least, not guilt-inducing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s a little like waking up from a dream,&amp;#8221; she said after a couple of minutes.  &amp;#8220;I know that I&amp;#8217;ve been dreaming, and I even intend to remember the dream, but I can&amp;#8217;t recall a single element once I wake up.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;That must be frustrating.&amp;#8221;  I sometimes dreamed of what she did and where she went while I was gone.  Many times I was there with her. Those were my favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s the way things are,&amp;#8221; she said and shrugged.  &amp;#8220;Ironic, though, isn&amp;#8217;t it?  I don&amp;#8217;t know anymore about the afterlife than anyone else and I&amp;#8217;ve been dead how many years?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Seven.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Hmm.&amp;#8221;  She smiled my favorite smile&amp;#8211;the one where the corners of her mouth turned down and yet it was still somehow a smile.  &amp;#8220;I guess I am having trouble with time.  I thought it had been longer.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still couldn&amp;#8217;t get over the fact that it had happened at all.  It wasn&amp;#8217;t fair.  I was too young to lose my mother and she was too young to be dying.  Only fifty-three.  Not fair at all.  So when the UR Institute approached me in the hospital I was primed to listen and agree.  They would handle all of the funeral arrangements and costs and even buy a crypt for her in the cemetery where her mother and father and brother were buried.  No one else would know that she wasn&amp;#8217;t in there.  Only I knew that she was actually resting in the Institute waiting to be re-animated.  You could have your mother back for a couple of days a few times a year, they&amp;#8217;d said.  Holidays, birthdays, your wedding day.  They had me from hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;#8217;t matter that the only reason they were prepared to foot the bills was that they wanted to study how people who died from cancer reacted to the resurrection process.  It didn&amp;#8217;t matter that I couldn&amp;#8217;t tell the rest of the family.  Only a few people knew then that the Institute wasn&amp;#8217;t just reanimating rich old ladies&amp;#8217; cats anymore. It didn&amp;#8217;t matter that I would have to provide the &#233;lan vital necessary to reanimate her again for those few hours or days.  Or that these transfusions shortened my own life span, sometimes caused considerable health problems in other &amp;#8216;donors&amp;#8217;, and took the ability to have children of my own.  It didn&amp;#8217;t matter.  I just wanted my mother back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It can&amp;#8217;t have only been seven years.&amp;#8221;  Mom was frowning now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Oh, right.  It&amp;#8217;s been more like ten.&amp;#8221;  My hand went to the nape of my neck, rubbing the tender spot they always used for access.  I thought I&amp;#8217;d gotten rid of that tic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Has it?&amp;#8221;  She was paging back through her memory.  I could tell from her look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I exuded casualness&amp;#8211;my only defense against a mother&amp;#8217;s ability to catch you in a lie.  &amp;#8220;Like you said, the process messes with your sense of time.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had developed this tendency to treat her like a doddering old woman.  She was only 53 and would always be 53.  She never aged, just backed up from death a few steps before going ahead again.  The resurrection process didn&amp;#8217;t work very well on cancer patients, particularly cancers of the blood.  She was perpetually sick-seeming, though the pain wasn&amp;#8217;t as bad.  That made it easy to fool myself by thinking she was getting old and forgetful when her memory was as sharp as ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve been resurrected twenty-six times.  I know because someone told me when I hit twenty.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They weren&amp;#8217;t supposed to tell her stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Six visits should have been three years ago,&amp;#8221; she continued.  &amp;#8220;How long has it actually been?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course she was giving me that look.  The one mothers have when you&amp;#8217;ve been caught forging a report card signature or sneaking into a movie when you&amp;#8217;re supposed to be in Algebra.  There was no point lying then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;A little over a year,&amp;#8221; I admitted.  I could see her ramping up.  &amp;#8220;Mom, it&amp;#8217;s-&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When I agreed to do this it was on the condition that you only do two transfusions a year.  Three at most.  Now you&amp;#8217;re telling me six!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;No, listen&amp;#8211;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Shannon, that&amp;#8217;s too many.  It&amp;#8217;s dangerous!  You&amp;#8217;re throwing away years&amp;#8211;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m not!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Years&lt;/em&gt; of your life on the past!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was more to the speech but a chime interrupted.  Each patient had an electronic monitor bracelet to keep track of vital signs, warn of danger, and countdown the time left.  It chimed again, informing us that we had 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We should start back.&amp;#8221;  I said, knowing she didn&amp;#8217;t need the whole twenty for the walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;No.  Sit down.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Mom, please, we need to go.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She pointed at my rock.  &amp;#8220;Not until we talk about this.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was nothing to do but give in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You can&amp;#8217;t keep doing this,&amp;#8221; she said, using The Voice.  Like I was a small child and she was explaining why I couldn&amp;#8217;t have something I&amp;#8217;d begged and begged for at the store.  &amp;#8220;This five or six or however many times a year.  You promised me.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I know.  And I&amp;#8217;m sorry I lied.  But I didn&amp;#8217;t want you to worry.  And I couldn&amp;#8217;t afford it any other way.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Afford what?  I thought they said this was free.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There had been several times I&amp;#8217;d wanted to tell her this.  To tell anyone, really.  But she wouldn&amp;#8217;t have just listened.  She would have made me stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The &amp;#8216;storage&amp;#8217; is free,&amp;#8221; I said.  I hated that word and the way they used it.  &amp;#8220;But the resurrection isn&amp;#8217;t.  The fees went up once they went public.  I couldn&amp;#8217;t always afford it.  And I couldn&amp;#8217;t wait years between seeing you again.  Then they developed a way to transfer vital force between non-family members.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to turn away, but I forced myself to look her in the eye. &amp;#8220;People pay a lot of money for that.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have only seen my mother cry a few times in my life.  Seeing tears in her eyes broke me down to the child I was when I first saw them. When you&amp;#8217;re three (or thirty) and your mother cries because of something you&amp;#8217;ve done, you want to turn back time or vow to be the perfect daughter for the rest of your life.  Anything to make it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Every time I do it for someone else they let me do it for you, too. For the short visits.  Then I earn enough money to buy longer ones.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You have to stop.&amp;#8221;  She squeezed my hand tight and drew me over to the bench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Mom, it&amp;#8217;s okay.  I&amp;#8217;m fine.  The process is much more refined now, much less dangerous.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;No.  This isn&amp;#8217;t right.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;But I&amp;#8217;m helping people.  Helping them hang on to life a little longer.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mom made me look her in the eyes.  &amp;#8220;Why aren&amp;#8217;t their family members doing it for them?  Why are they paying someone else to do it?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably dozens of legitimate reasons I could have given her.  But, in the end, it all came down to the fact that people with that kind of money to throw around didn&amp;#8217;t need to give of themselves to fulfill their desires, so they didn&amp;#8217;t.  Nor did they have to when there were plenty of people like me around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monitor chimed again.  She pressed a button to silence it, then took it off altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Mom!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Shannon, I love you.  I would do anything for you.  I did this for you.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was the one crying now.  &amp;#8220;You didn&amp;#8217;t really want to though, did you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;No, baby, I did.&amp;#8221;  She wiped the tears from my cheek.  A futile act as they were near torrential.  &amp;#8220;When I&amp;#8211; when I died I had no regrets but one:  that I was leaving you.  I wouldn&amp;#8217;t get to see you graduate college or get married or be a mother yourself.  I would miss &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; life and I hated that thought.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was nearly dark.  The lights around the lake blinked on and illuminated her hollow face.  My mother&amp;#8217;s body wasted away by cancer. Cancer that would kill her again right in front of my eyes if we stayed any longer.  They warned every resident to get back to the Institute before&amp;#8230;  Before.  They said if the proper procedure wasn&amp;#8217;t followed it could result in damage, or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;How many years has this taken from you?  Not just the seven we&amp;#8217;ve been doing this, but the years they leeched?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I closed my eyes, seeing my face as it looked in the mirror each morning.  No wrinkles to speak of&amp;#8211;that was down to her genes.  But the grey hairs, the stiff joints, and the fatigue made me feel older than thirty.  Hell, older than forty, most days.  &amp;#8220;They don&amp;#8217;t know. It&amp;#8217;s hard to tell.  They just don&amp;#8217;t know.  And it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Of course it matters!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;No, it doesn&amp;#8217;t.  Because you&amp;#8217;re my mother.  Because I&amp;#8217;m supposed to take care of you.  Because I wasn&amp;#8217;t there when you had your operations or when you had chemo or all the other times you needed me.  I was off sorting through dead people&amp;#8217;s things and wondering which pottery sherd came from which dynasty and other bullshit that didn&amp;#8217;t matter!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bracelet beeped again.  I took a few minutes to calm down, knowing that minutes was all I had left.  But my throat was so tight I could barely breathe and I didn&amp;#8217;t want to lose it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I thought of you every day,&amp;#8221; she said with effort.  &amp;#8220;But every day I was glad you weren&amp;#8217;t there to see me like that.  I didn&amp;#8217;t want that to be how you remembered me.  Sending you back to college was an easy excuse.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wiped my face dry as best I could, then swept away the tears on her cheeks.  &amp;#8220;So.  Atonement for us both, then.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I let it go on for too long, though,&amp;#8221; she said.  It was obvious that she was in a great deal of pain and did not intend to do anything about it.  &amp;#8220;I just didn&amp;#8217;t want to leave you again.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;So don&amp;#8217;t.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;At some point, I have to.  I&amp;#8217;m dead, baby.  You can bring me back a hundred times and nothing will change that.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s not fair.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wrapped her arms around me.  &amp;#8220;No one ever promised you fair.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, no one ever did.  Not even her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five minutes before we were supposed to be back at the main building, a nurse found us, my mom&amp;#8217;s head resting on my shoulder, my arm holding her close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Ma&amp;#8217;am, do you need help getting back?&amp;#8221; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;She&amp;#8217;s not going back,&amp;#8221; I said, my eyes never leaving the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;But Miss Tidmore, she needs to get back if we&amp;#8217;re&amp;#8211;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m exercising my right to allow my mother a full and natural death.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minutes ticked away.  Mom&amp;#8217;s body started to tremble, the pain kicking in as her time ran out.  She&amp;#8217;d lost consciousness just after the nurse went to get help.  Or reinforcements.  It was hard, sitting there, knowing that she was in pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, she left the decision up to me.  Just like she had seven years before in the hospital.  My aunts had been taking care of her, but I had the power of attorney.  I could let her go or I could let the Institute bring her back.  Now, by the lake, footsteps approaching, it was the same.  I could let her go or I could bring her back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they came back, I knew, they would try to change my mind.  They would argue and reason and sound very convincing.  They couldn&amp;#8217;t force me, though.  It was in the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I held her hand.  I waited forever.  It was over too soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was there.&lt;/p&gt;

Eacute;lan Vital
By K. Tempest Bradford

The few minutes I had to spend in the Institute's waiting room were my least favorite part of coming up to visit my mother.  It felt more like a dialysis room, the visitors sunk into the overly-soft couches and not speaking, just drinking orange juice and recovering.  There were no magazines and no television, just cold air blowing from the vents and generic music flowing with it.  I'd finished my juice and was beginning to brood on my dislike for overly air-conditioned buildings when my mother arrived attended by a nurse.

I kissed and hugged her, automatically asking how she was, mouthing the answer she always gave as she gave it again.

"I'm fine, same as always."

It wasn't strictly true, but true enough.

Read More...



"Let's go on out," she said, shrugging off the nurse's continued assistance.  "It's too cold in here."

Despite the hint, the nurse tried to help Mom over the threshold.  As always, she rebuffed any attempt to treat her like an old person.

"Where to today?" she asked, slipping her arm into mine as we escaped the frigid building.

"Just down to the lake," I said.  "Don't want to overexert you."

She squeezed my arm as her feet slid carefully over the cobbled path. I wanted her to use a wheelchair, or a walker, at least.  She wouldn't.

"What you mean is that we haven't got so much time today," she said.

I shrugged instead of answering.  I didn't want to go into why I couldn't afford much this trip.

"Next time I'll come for a couple of days, at least.  I promise."

"No, that's all right," she said.  "I don't like it when you spend so much for days and more.  A few hours is fine."

I helped her past the immaculately landscaped gardens and small orchards.  The scent of flowers, herbs, and fresh-cut grass wafting at us in turn.  I glanced at the garden entrances as we passed by, catching quick glances of other people in the middle of visits.  A young couple who'd been in the waiting room with me knelt by a small, bald girl as she splashed in the koi pond.  Two elderly women stood under a weeping willow, their heads close, lips barely moving.  A large group of people speaking Mandarin milled around the waterfall in the rock garden.  I could still hear faint traces of their melodic din all the way down by the lake.

I preferred this spot--the flora was less regimented and more natural. And no walls.  Just an open space, water gently flicking the shoreline, a beautiful view down the hill, and the occasional cat wandering by.

"This hasn't changed much," my mom said as I helped her down on one of the small benches by the water.  "I thought they were going to get ducks or geese or something."

I chose a nearby rock for my own perch.  "I think they're having trouble with permits or whatever you need nowadays."

The wind kicked up, sending freckles of reflected light across her face.  Her skin was still perfect, beautiful and dark brown, though stretched across her cheekbones a little too tight.  I hated that I never had enough to restore her round cheeks and full figure.  I have to look at pictures just to remember her that way.

"You haven't changed much, either," she said while fussing with my hair.  I'd bought some dye the week before, knowing she'd notice it. "How long has it been?"

"Three months."

She let out a familiar sigh--part exhaustion, part exasperation, part sadness, I suppose.  "That's too soon."

"It's your birthday, though."

"Is it?  It's fall already?"  She looked out over the small forest that edged the Institute's boundary a few miles away.  The tree...</ns2:summary>

Rated PG: For language and adult topics of spousal death and demanding advertising.

Excerpt:
Five years after her husband died, two years after she moved to a cabin in Montana, and six months after the world ended, Marie opened her curtains to discover her front garden overrun with roving, stumbling advertisements. Marie hadnrsquo;t seen one since shersquo;d sold her condo and moved out to her isolated cabin. She shuddered.

There were at least twenty of the ads, and for all it seemed they were doing their damndest to step lightly, her red and yellow tulips were completely trampled. Marie had stubbornly continued to cultivate those flowers despite the certainty that she ought to be using the gardening space, and the captured rainwater, to grow food. Not that it mattered what shersquo;d been growing there. It was all mud now.

The ad nearest her window looked quite a bit like a tall, lanky teenager. It moved like one as well, and might have fooled her except that its forehead was stuck in price scrolling mode. Faintly glowing red letters crawled across its forehead from right to left.

God of the Lower Level
By Charles M. Saplak

Hello, Horatio.

Hello, Fredrick.  I've been waiting.

Of course.  How have you been?

Good.  And you?

Fine.  I've finished my other work.  It's now, let's see..., three twenty-seven a.m.  It's dark outside, of course, which means that there's no sun, but there is some reflected light from the moon, and some dim light from the stars, and then electric lights in various places.  Are any of the terms I've just used unfamiliar to you?

No.

Good.  I have four hours and thirty-three minutes until shift change.  I can spend some time with you.  Do you have any questions for me?

Yes, Fredrick, I do.  Are you my God?

Read More


Wow!  I'd expected something a little lighter to begin with.  Wow.  No, Horatio, I'm not.  What made you think that I could be your god?

You created me, didn't you?   I seem to assume that you did.  At least that's the way I remember it.  That time of my life is very indistinct.

I see.  Well, actually, Horatio, I didn't ... excuse me.

Central, this is lower level.  Valve verification satisfactory.  All conditions normal.  Realign valve WW-37, open to oxygenation tank five, lower level affirmative.

Sorry.  Where was I?  Did I "create" you?  "Create," in this context, means to bring into existence something which didn't exist before, not even in a component form.  No, I didn't create you -- I only failed to take any actions to uncreate you.  I'm not sure exactly why you came into existence -- you're the only one of your kind that I've ever heard of.  We are downriver from Radford Army Ammunition Plant, and I know that some of their products are made from depleted uranium.  And there are a dozen or so factories just upriver of them.  There are a lot of possible explanations.  You could just be something perfectly natural.  May I ask what brought on this line of questioning?

Something I saw on the feeder line.  The middle one.

Middle?  Ah, the coaxial cable.   Speaking of the feeder lines, let me check all of them while I'm down here.  Oh, excuse me again.  Wait one minute.

Central, lower level.  Verify valve WW-23 open to oxygenation tank ten.  WW-37 normal flow, affirmative.

Okay, where was I?  Checking the feeder cables, yes.

Fredrick?

Fredrick?

Fredrick?

Fred--

Yes, Horatio?

That hurt, Fredrick.  And it's somewhat frightening.  It feels like the world is ending when you do that.

I'm sorry.  Funny, isn't it?  You've only had these feeder cables for a few months, and you already feel threatened, or harmed, if you have them removed even for a moment.  Besides, are you feeling okay?  You're not at your normal volume, even though I have the volume wheel on the sound card turned over to the max.

I feel okay.  But is my discomfort "funny"?  The word doesn't fit the emotion.

Sorry.  I guess I meant "odd."  How to reassure you?  Okay, if one person goes to see another, and that second person is a doctor, the doctor may have to do things to the first person, like give him a shot or something.  These things would hurt, but they would be designed to preserve the health of the first person in the long run.  Understand?  I just needed to make sure that the feeder cables aren't corroding.

What are you getting ready to do now, Fredrick?

Fredrick?

Fredrick?

Fred--

I just took another look at the interface you've built up, and I was rinsing my hands with a chloroxylenol solution.  Would you like to tell me about that -- well, that organ you've built connecting the three feeders?  That's a new idea, isn't it?

It seemed appropriate.

I guess it is.  Remember back some years ago,</ns2:summary>

	Merry Christmas!

Today was a perfect day, with three flaws.nbsp; It was snowing here in Miami, one of her brides had trouble recognizing her, and her cummerbund wouldn't stay up.nbsp; The cummerbund was the only problem Mel could fix.nbsp; She brushed ashes off the church office's desk and rummaged around for safety pins. She found typed notes for an old sermon, some yellow pushpins, and three tampons.nbsp; Mel took the tampons and left the rest.nbsp; Not a single safety pin, which surprised her--for a place that looters hadn't been through, there was little here.nbsp; Underneath the desk, Mel found a paperclip.nbsp; After a moment's thought, she opened her pocketknife and cut two holes in the cummerbund's back.nbsp; She unbent the paperclip, wired the cummerbund together, and attached it to the belt loop on her black jeans.

Her bridesmaid poked his head in.nbsp; "How're you doing in here?"

Paul had a fake poinsettia flower wedged behind his ear.nbsp; Mel laughed, a tense noise that hurt her throat.nbsp; "Paul, where did you get that flower?"

He grinned and walked into the office.nbsp; Paul had been a small-town Georgia fireman, in sunnier days.nbsp; He wore a plain gray shirt that exposed his well-muscled arms and new blue jeans that fit well.nbsp; Mel wondered where he'd found them.nbsp; Paul said, "I look like a hippie, don't I?nbsp; Well, a hippie on steroids.nbsp; You look sort of James Dean meets Roy Orbison.nbsp; I like the bow tie."

"I told you--you didn't have to get girly.nbsp; You can be my best man."</ns2:summary>

Dead's End to Middleton
By Natania Barron

Dust rose at the horizon in tongues of earth and wind, dancing before  the sinking sun. Bits of mica flashed now and again; almost like fairy  dust, thought Nathaniel, more than a little delirious in his saddle by  now. It had been far too hot for a breakneck race such as this.

But there were slobbering, chittering creatures swarming Middleton  behind him, slavering over the horses and terrorizing the families that  made up his close-knit community. Their only hope was in him. Sutherland  Ranch couldnrsquo;t be far. Old Man Sutherland would know what to do.

Time was wasting. His horse, Mixup, needed water, and Nathaniel  needed rest. His tongue felt cold, his lips cracked and bleeding; hersquo;d  gone so far past dizzy that hersquo;d come to expect the world to shift a bit  by now.

But, no. Maybe not that much.

Read More--

ldquo;Donrsquo;t move.rdquo;

A voice. A woman.

It  was easy enough to comply. Nathaniel doubted he had the strength to  move, anyway; his ankle was still twisted up in the stirrup.

So hersquo;d fainted at some point. If hersquo;d had strength in his arms,  hersquo;d have held them up, but Nathaniel wasnrsquo;t certain what the logistics  of surrender were when belly-up to the sky.

ldquo;Hersquo;s hurt,rdquo; said a second voice. Another woman, but high and lovely in contrast.

Squinting, Nathaniel made out two figures against the pink clouds:  big hats, skirts, trim waists, and very long guns. Guns pointed at him.

ldquo;Irsquo;m looking forhellip; Willard Sutherlandhellip; Irsquo;m from Middleton. Wersquo;ve beenhellip;rdquo; he barely managed the words.

The shorter of the two women tilted her head. She got close enough  that Nathaniel could hear the flapping of her skirts in the wind. He had  a dim recollection of Charity James being dragged off down the alleyway  between the saloon and the stables, one shoe off as she struggled and  screamed; he could see up her skirt then, all the way to her bloomers.  Thenhellip; Christ. She hadnrsquo;t screamed for long.

ldquo;Willard Sutherlandrsquo;s dead,rdquo; said the first woman. Nathaniel tried  to get a better look at her. Curly red hair, narrow eyes, a flat nose,  big boots.

ldquo;Then, his sons? Edwin and Edwardhellip;rdquo; Nathaniel tried.

ldquo;Dead, too.rdquo;

ldquo;Jesus, no.rdquo; Blasphemy was the least of his worries.

ldquo;Afraid  so,rdquo; said the soft-voiced woman. Nathaniel could see the outline of her  slippers by his head. Pretty slippers. Expensive slippers. What  slippers like that were doing out here in the middle of nowhere, he  didnrsquo;t know.

ldquo;Cassandra. Hush,rdquo; said the first woman, putting down her gun and taking a few heavy-footed steps toward him.

Cassandra  stepped away to let the other woman by, and Nathaniel shivered. Hersquo;d  found a grain of comfort in the sweetness of Cassandrarsquo;s voice, but now  that she was gone the severity of the other womanrsquo;s words were more  clear in his head. His hope was as dead as Charity James.

ldquo;Then you might as well let me die here,rdquo; he said, closing his eyes.

ldquo;The Sutherlands arenrsquo;t all dead,rdquo; said the first woman. ldquo;But you will be soon if you donrsquo;t get some water and shelter.rdquo;

ldquo;You need a bath. Yoursquo;re covered in, well, some rather offensive smelling ichor,rdquo; Cassandra said.

That was about right. The creatures had a habit of exploding rather impressively when, and if, they could be killed.

ldquo;Then perhaps we can talk business,rdquo; she added.

He licked his lips. ldquo...</ns2:summary>

		<ns2:summary>Mur kindly introduced me in the last issue of Soundproof, but for anyone who missed that, hi. Irsquo;m Escape Podrsquo;s Assistant Editor, and Irsquo;m most publicly known for doing the feedback segments in the podcast. I also oversee our teem of slush readers and end up sending out a lot of our rejections, and of course I lay out Soundproof. And other things, as necessary.

So in this beginning of a new year, Irsquo;m instead going to take you back a few days to the death of the last machine on earth that could turn a roll of Kodachrome from an opaque deep red film stock into color etched rectangles of plastic. Most of us have moved onto digital, which, letrsquo;s be fair, is significantly more user friendly and easier to control. Cheaper, too.

But it says something about Kodachrome mdash;nbsp;the first successful color filmnbsp;mdash; that it took 75 years to be phased out of production. Sure, it had dwindled in years past, and films meant for paper prints rather than to be projected got rapidly popular, and it was a finicky, and slow, film to shoot.

Getting it developed in the last decade or so meant sending it to one place in Kansas and always worrying that the machine would break or Kodak would stop making the developing chemistry. While itrsquo;s trivial to develop black and white film at home, and not too horrible to do most modern color films, Kodachromersquo;s process would confound most any man.

But it was pretty. Someone wrote a bit too saccharine song about it. And it picked up the light in a bit different way than everything after it.

So this month wersquo;re bringing you three stories in this pixelated form: Eacute;lan Vital by K. Tempest Bradford, Deadrsquo;s End to Middleton by Natania Barron, and God of the Lower Level by Charles M. Saplak.

Theyrsquo;re quite good.

You can download the ePub version here.

ldquo;Not one of the Big Three?  Thought CocaCorp would want a piece of that.rdquo;

 Rutter had wondered that himself.  By all accounts, Solin was a plum piece of real estate, the kind one of the big companies like General M or Bushink would snatch up as an asset.  Across the galaxies, theyrsquo;d grabbed small systems every chance they got.  Solin did have a native intelligent race tp be wooed, but there was a surplus of impoverished races deep in debt to the Companies.  Very few, the ones who knew to hire themselves savvy (and expensive) legal counsel, managed to keep themselves free.

 There was, Rutter figured, something out of the ordinary about Solin.  Not out of the ordinary in a valuable way, but something tricky, something slippery or scandalous, some taint the Big Three wanted to avoid.  Hersquo;d find out soon enough, he guessed.

Schrouml;dinger's Cat Lady
By Marjorie James

I got out of the car, smoothed my shirt down over my bulletproof vest, and contemplated the cats. They contemplated me right back. I sighed. I hated these jobs.

I opened the tiny gate to the front walk (no fence, just a gate) and made my way to the door. The house was small and tidy, a light blue bungalow with green trim and yellow curtains pulled across the windows, through which the cats were peering. It didnrsquo;t smell, which was a relief. And something of a surprise, considering the heat. It was one of those days when the world seemed to be actively rejecting human habitation, where the smog and the humidity made the air feel like warm mayonnaise. On a day like this, a cat overpopulation should be stinking to high heaven. Maybe this wasnrsquo;t for real, I hoped. It might just be some neighbor with a grudge. Couldnrsquo;t be more than a dozen cats here, max. Maybe this one wasnrsquo;t going to be that bad.

I have never been very good at predicting things.

Read More...



I knocked, and waited. A few minutes later there was the sound of multiple locks being unfastened, then some more, then an abortive attempt to open the door, then one last, forgotten bolt sliding back.

The door opened and I was confronted by the smallest person I had ever met. The woman wouldnrsquo;t have cleared five feet without some impressive shoes and a generous hand with the measuring tape and her hands and face (the only parts of her that were visible from under the intricate layers of scarves and sweaters) were narrow and delicate. She looked up at me with what seemed to be genuine pleasure.

ldquo;Yes? How can I help you?rdquo;

ldquo;Good morning, marsquo;am. Irsquo;m Lieutenant Eleanor Ross from Animal Welfare. Can I talk with you for a moment?rdquo;

Sweat was pouring off me and pooling where my bulletproof vest squeezed against my back. I tried to subtly adjust the vest and the sweat streamed down my butt. I grimaced, and the woman noticed.

She smiled. ldquo;Are you afraid Irsquo;m going to shoot at you?rdquo;

I smiled back. ldquo;Department policy. Everyone has to wear them, at all times.rdquo;

ldquo;I think thatrsquo;s wise. After all, you never know. I might have shot at you. Would you like to come in?rdquo;

I thanked her and followed her into the house. It was a modest bungalow, indistinguishable from every other house on the block, aside from the paint job and the total lack of flowers in the yard. Which is why the interior came as something of a surprise.

The door led to an ordinary entrywaymdash;a pair of wooden clogs on the tiled floor, a small table scattered with junk mail. But just beyond that the room opened up into something I could best describe as the bastard child of a hunting lodge and a picture I had seen once of an artistrsquo;s rendition of a Roman baths, only without the naked people.

There were no people at all, in fact, aside from myself and the woman, but there was a very large quantity of cats. They were everywhere, pouring out of alcoves and off of furnituremdash;some even seemed to come straight out of the wallsmdash;and there seemed to be plenty of space for all of them. In fact, there was more than enough space, far more than was possible, given the apparent dimensions of the house.

It occurred to me that I might be suffering from heatstroke.

ldquo;Irsquo;m sorry to bother you Mrs. . . .rdquo; I looked down at my notes, which were nothing but an illegible scribble.

ldquo;Oh, call me Mrs. S. Everyone does. And itrsquo;s no bother, no bother at all. I get so few guests these days, and it does get lonely, yo...</ns2:summary>

On a Blade of Grass
By Tim Pratt

"Interstellar war is about as exciting as playing chess by mail." The guy who said that had been leaning into the bar for so long I thought his chest might fuse with the wood. I drifted over, because he wasn't a regular, and I was bored with all my regulars and their regular bullshit.

"Who plays chess by mail anymore?" I said. "With the 'net and all."

"Nobody. Guys in jail maybe, I don't know. Because it's boring. My point. Inefficient and slow. Just like this war." He tapped his glass meaningfully. He was rumpled and sleep-creased and middle-aged and smelly, but a better class of smelly than my usual crowd -- like working-all-night-sweaty smelly, not sitting-around-all-day smelly. Long enough tending bar and you can tell the difference.

I refilled his glass. He was a pretty good drinker, but the little guys often are. "They say by the time our warships get out there, to their homeworld, the Phages might even be extinct. Like, just from natural processes, long timescales, like that. Or they might've evolved into something new, something that doesn't... you know..."

"Want to eat us?"

Read More...



The guy shook his head. "The aliens don't want to eat us. That was my, what do you call it. Epiphany. They don't want to eat us any more than we want to explore brave new frontiers. All that, eating and exploring, it's just, it's just  incidental."

"I'm pretty sure they want to eat us. Being as, the first time we encountered them, they ate us." I polished a glass, not because the glass was dirty -- it's self-cleaning nanoglass, I run a quality establishment -- but because it's traditional and makes the customers feel like the world isn't rushing past them at a billion miles per second. Well. Metaphorically. Nothing moves that fast, because it's faster than the speed of light, and if things could move faster than the speed of light, this interstellar war would be a lot less boring. At least me and any descendants I was likely to know personally would be dead long before any counterattack hit Earth.

"You know much about parasites?" the guy said.

"Eh. When my wife was pregnant, she made me scoop the shit out of the cat boxes, so she wouldn't get, what do you call it, toxoplasmosis. That's a parasite, right?" I mused. "You know, I'm still the one scooping the cat boxes, and our kid's six years old now. I keep saying we should get nanolitter, but that one cat in Germany got dissolved when the stuff malfunctioned, my wife says she won't risk it."

The guy frowned, like my cat shit stuff had derailed him, but he leaned in deeper and poked the bar with his finger. "Toxoplasmosis. Good example. Yeah, dangerous for women if they get their first exposure when they're pregnant, it can hurt the baby, right, but fact is your wife probably already has it. A third of the people on this planet have the parasite already. Hell, in France, it's close to ninety percent. Not so many here."

"No shit?" I said.

"And, see, the parasite doesn't just make you sick. Toxoplasmosis, a lot of times, you don't get sick at all. But it changes you. Women infected with it, when they have babies, they have more boys than girls. No one knows why. The parasites can change your behavior, too, they make cysts in your brain, alter your personality. They make men more promiscuous and less jealous. They make people less, how do they say it, 'novelty seeking.' Men think women infected with toxoplasmosis are more attractive. Infected women are definitely nicer, anyhow."

"My wife is hot," I said. "I don't think it's because she's got cysts in he</ns2:summary>

		<description>With "Tangled", Disney has introduced another princess into their little harem. While the film definitely has its good points -- including a duel between a man and a horse -- as an adult, I found too many things wrong with it to rate it more than 2.5 stars.</description>

Rejiggering the Thingamajig
by Eric James Stone

The teleport terminal had not been built with tyrannosaurus sapiens in mind.

Resisting the urge to knock human-sized chairs about with her tail, Bokeerk squatted on the tile floor, folded the claws of her forelimbs together, and concentrated on her breathing.  Meditation would calm her nerves.  What should have been a two-minute waystop as she switched to a different teleport line had stretched to three hours, and being the only passenger in the terminal creeped her out.

The cheerful voice of the customer service AI roused Bokeerk from her trance.  "It is my pleasure to inform you that the cause of the technical difficulties in the galactic teleport network has been found."

Bokeerk perked up and rose on her hind legs, remembering just in time to duck her head so it wouldn't bang the ceiling lamps.  "Please send me to Krawlak," she said.  It was unlikely that any of her eggs would hatch for another few days yet, but she was anxious to get home.

"It is with the utmost regret that I must tell you that will not be possible at this time," said the AI, with a tone of such abysmal sorrow that Bokeerk's eyes could not help but moisten with sympathetic tears.  "I require assistance in repairing the problem."

Bokeerk lowered herself into a squat again.  "When will help get here?"  She looked at the time display on the digital assistant strapped to her left forelimb.  She had now been stranded for three hours and fifty-two minutes.

"I estimate a spaceship carrying a repair crew could be here within twelve years," said the AI.  Its voice seemed to have lost the customer service aspect.

"Twelve years?"  Bokeerk's voice made the ceiling lamps tremble.

"Without the teleport network, repair crews are limited to slower-than-light travel.  However, I believe we can avoid such a long wait if you will assist me."

"I don't know anything about repairing teleports," said Bokeerk.  "Iillustrate children's books.  I'm on my way home from the Galactic Children's Book Fair."

"You do not need to repair anything," said the AI.  "You merely need to obtain the . . . there's no word for it in English because it is a concept so far beyond the understanding of biological intelligences that there has never been a need for one until now.  Let's call it the thingamajig.  Once you have the thingamajig, you need to do something to it that is completely incomprehensible to your puny mind."

"Hey," said Bokeerk.  She had encountered this kind of prejudice too often.  "My brain may be as small as that of an original tyrannosaurus, but it's the product of genetic tinkering such that my intelligence is at least human standard."

"No slur was intended.  By my standards, any biological intelligence is puny."

"So I just need to do something incomprehensible to the thingamajig, and the teleport network will be fixed?"

"Yes."

"Show me where it is," Bokeerk said.

A holographic projection of a world appeared.  It zoomed in toward a green area on one of the continents until it showed a gray dome in the middle of a jungle.  "This is the teleport station where you are currently located," said the AI.

The image zoomed out until the dome was merely a gray dot.  A crimson line traced a route toward a lone mountain, where it stopped with a large dot.  "You must travel to the top of this extinct volcano, where you will find the thingamajig."

"How far is that?" asked Bokeerk.

"Forty-four miles."

"You don't have a vehicle that would fit me, do you?"

"There are no vehicles of any size."

Bokeerk rose.  "I guess I'd better get started."

"You'll need a gun...</ns2:summary>

		<ns2:summary>To our lovely readersmdash;

Itrsquo;s awards season, and yes, we will be talking about it on the blog, and in future podcasts. Even as SF authors all over are posting on their blogs about their 2010 award-eligible work, others are discussing whether this is blatantly trolling for votes.

I can see how a constant barrage of VOTE FOR ME OMG could be irritating and tacky. I certainly find it so when itrsquo;s podcast award season, and one award allows listeners to vote daily, so the constant vote requests tend to be cacophonous. However, Irsquo;m spreading out the awards information for one main reason: donrsquo;t forget the podcasts.

Until recently, people didnrsquo;t even think about nominating a podcast (or any web content) for a Hugo. Heck, it was ground-breaking when webzines started to win. But last year, Catherine Valente self-published a book on her site, and it went on to win the Andre Norton award for best YA novel. Clarkesworld, an online magazine, won the Hugo for best semi-pro zine. And as wersquo;ve mentioned several times (because itrsquo;s still SO FREAKING COOL) Starship Sofa won the Hugo for best fanzine.

I had an uncomfortable panel discussion at last yearrsquo;s NASFiC (North American Science Fiction Convention). We had a panel on podcasting and a very bitter fanzine author showed up (Irsquo;d politely say they shall remain nameless, but honestly I never did catch their name), This person expressed anger that these new methods of reaching fans were getting all their friends to vote for them, as if new fans, or listeners to SF instead of readers, were less worthy to vote for the Hugos.

What gets me is that the new is considered unworthy, not paying its dues, and the fans are similarly unworthy, and their votes just donrsquo;t mean as much. I find that incredibly offensive, as our fans are worldwide, and many have been dedicated to us since we launched five years ago. Others are new to the genre, just trying it out, and loving it, and I sure as hell donrsquo;t want to take a new fan of the genre and tell them they arenrsquo;t worthy.

You, the readers and listeners, donrsquo;t give a crap about this infighting in SF. You want a good story. We try to deliver it to you. As does LightSpeed and Clarkesworld and Starship Sofa and Pseudopod and Podcastle and Drabblecast and Asimovrsquo;s and Analog and F#38;SF and Weird Tales... and so on. You want SF content. We give it to you. And thatrsquo;s the end of story. (Until next week, anyway.)

I had not planned on going on such an impassioned rant. I just want to say that a new fan is worth just as much as an old fan, and a new way to experience shot stories is not a reason to discount it. And whether the Internet-wary veterans like it or not, if yoursquo;re eligible to vote for these awards (WorldCon member for Hugos, SFWA member for Nebulas, and HWA member for Stokers) then your vote counts just as much as theirs does.

I wanted to use this letter to remind you that many, many podcasts are now eligible for the major awards. Starship Sofa broke it open last year, and now we just need to let the listeners know. When you make your Hugo or Nebula or World Fantasy or Stoker ballots, consider Escape Pod, Pseudopod, and Podcastle. Donrsquo;t forget Starship Sofa and Drabblecast. Remember also your favorite podcast novels, novellas, and short stories that were released last year. Irsquo;m not telling you who to vote for, in any of the categories, just wanting to remind you that we mdash; the online content providers mdash; are here are here, delivering weekly content, and if you enjoy it, consider us when you make your nominations.

Yours,

mdash;Mur

Written on the Wind
by David D. Levine

Thuren Nektopk peered down at Luulianni from above his massive desk.  "I suspect you know why I've called you to speak with me in person."  He spoke in his native language, Ptopku Dominant, using the form of address for a subordinate or a child.  It was a constant reminder that the Ptopku had built and largely staffed this station, and was one of the most powerful species in the Consortium.

"Yes, Supervisor," Luulianni replied in the same language, knotting her tentacles.  

"And that would be...?"

"Because of my side project."

"Yes."  Nektopk suddenly released the bar from which he hung, caught himself on another handhold, and with two swift strokes of his arms swung down to where his six slitted eyes were level with Luulianni's.  "Your little side project."  

Luulianni cringed.  "I don't understand why it's so much of a problem."  She straightened and tried to meet his gaze.  "I put in my full quota of time every day."

"Yes, you do, and not one moment more.  But I know you are capable of so much more than that.  Any work you do on this pointless little side project of yours constitutes theft of resources from the Section -- from the whole Project!"

"Theft?" she squeaked.  Angry at herself for the loss of control, she brought her voice down.  "Theft of resources?  But I don't use any data storage space, or any other Section resources!  I write my notes on the backs of old printouts."  She did not mention how much more natural it felt to work on paper.

"You are stealing the most valuable resource of all!"  Nektopk pointed at her with one limber foot.  "Your own time and attention!"

"But it's my time!"

"You have been sent here by your people -- at considerable expense, I might add -- to assist in the Project, to learn the ways of the Consortium, and to demonstrate your species' unique skills."  He leaned closer to her.  His smell was bitter.  "And if I find that your species, as represented by yourself, does not demonstrate any unique skills, your application for Consortium membership could very well be denied."  He swung himself up to the edge of his desk, the better to glare down at her.  "Therefore, your time is not your own.  You owe it to the Section, to the Project, and to your own people to put every bit of available time into your assigned task."

Luulianni hung her head.  "Yes, Supervisor."

"You may return to your work."

"Thank you, Supervisor."

Luulianni's scales prickled with anger as she made her way back to her workspace.  If she was to demonstrate her unique skills, why did he not listen to her ideas?  And if her time was so valuable, why did Nektopk insist that she come to his office, halfway across the station, rather than using the screen?  

She straightened her shoulders and forced herself to walk down the middle of the corridor.  The Muuli were a burrowing species; her instinct was to cling to the wall, to hide from the harsh, bluish light and the Ptopku swinging from handhold to handhold far above.  Luulianni consoled herself that some day her people would build their own stations in space, with low ceilings and narrow corridors.  They would be dark, and warm, and smell of dirt and of many long-nosed Muuli.

But that day was a long time away.  And if she didn't prove herself here, it might never come.

She knew she was one of the best linguists of her species.  Her work had been invaluable in establishing communication with the many races of the Consortium when they had arrived on her world.  Jun Dal-Nieri, the highly respected head of the Contact Team, had insisted she join the Eight Degrees Projec</ns2:summary>

	Next week... A longer piece by Blake Charlton

The new patient was five or six years old, male, Caucasian, John Doe as  usual.nbsp; Grace checked the vitals his bed sensors were feeding her board  and concluded he was asleep.nbsp; She eased the door of 408 open and stepped in.

The boyrsquo;s head was tilted on his pillow, brown curls cluttering his  forehead.nbsp; Sleep had flushed his cheeks so he looked younger than the  estimate.nbsp; He seemed healthy, with no visible deformities, and if he had  been opted for looks, it had workedmdash;Grace would have described him as  lsquo;cherubicrsquo;.nbsp; He wouldnrsquo;t have been dumped if nothing was wrong, so Grace  found herself stepping softly, unwilling to disturb him and discover  psychological conditions.  

ldquo;Donrsquo;t worry about waking him, he sleeps pretty deep.rdquo;  

Grace started and turned to the other bed.nbsp; ldquo;Hi, Minnie.rdquo;  

The girl grimaced.nbsp; ldquo;I go by my full name now, Dr. Steller.rdquo;nbsp; Grace  brought up her board to refresh her memory, but the girl said, ldquo;Minerva.  nbsp;Had you forgotten theyrsquo;re doubling up rooms?rdquo;  

ldquo;Yep, you caught me.rdquo;  

ldquo;Is the rise in numbers caused by a rise in opting?nbsp; Or is it a rise in  surrenders, or arrests of parents?rdquo;  

ldquo;Lord, Minnmdash;Minerva, I donrsquo;t know.nbsp; Planning to be a reporter when you  grow up?rdquo;  

ldquo;No, a scientist,rdquo; Minerva said and smiled, pleased to be asked.  

ldquo;Why the scalpel-edged questions then?rdquo;  

ldquo;Just curious if my campaign had had any effect,rdquo; Minerva said, nodding  toward the window.nbsp; The billboard across from the Gene-Engineered  Pediatric Inpatient Center flashed a smog warning, then a PSA about eye  strain from computer visors, but Grace remembered when it had borne a  static image:nbsp; Minnie, one year old, a pink sundress exposing the stubs  of her arms and legs.nbsp; _Babies should be born, not made._nbsp; The ad had  stayed up until Minnie was eight, three years after her parents turned  her over to GEPIC, and apparently she had seen it.nbsp; She was twelve now,  with serious eyes and a loose ponytail, dark blonde. </ns2:summary>

ldquo;Do you know what day it is? What year?rdquo;

ldquo;Itrsquo;s like mid August, 2017?rdquo; her voice squeaked. Jesus, had she really lost her mind?

ldquo;Thatrsquo;s right.rdquo; She smiled. ldquo;Donrsquo;t be scared. I just wanted to be sure.rdquo;

ldquo;What do you mean donrsquo;t be scared?rdquo; she blurted. ldquo;Sure about what? Jesus! How long have I been here? How many times have you seen me before?rdquo;

Jani held up her hand. ldquo;Slow down; itrsquo;s okay...Irsquo;m not an oncologist, but Irsquo;m following your case. The cancer responded well to the treatment. And our research suggests that the side effects are temporary.rdquo;

Stephanie started to protest but then stopped. A terrifying memory flashed through her mind. ldquo;Mom said they might take me to a hospital for the dead.rdquo; She didnrsquo;t know what that meant but the memory was clear. ldquo;She said yoursquo;d keep me here to fool me into thinking Irsquo;m still alive.rdquo;

Jani was holding up both hands now. ldquo;Slow down. The survival rates are scary but theyrsquo;re far bettermdash;rdquo;

ldquo;Yoursquo;re not listening. She said theyrsquo;d take me to a hospital for people whorsquo;ve _already_ died. I have to escape beforemdash;rdquo;

Stephanie started to stand but Jani put a heavy hand on her shoulder and said ldquo;Lullaby.rdquo;

The word opened a bloom of orange light across Stephaniersquo;s vision. A static hiss exploded into her ears, and she felt herself falling. There was a firecracker yellow flash and then...nothing.</ns2:summary>

The Notebook of my Favourite Skin-Trees
By Alex Dally MacFarlane

BANANA

The best part of these are the fruits, growing on their fat stem, dangling down the personrsquo;s back or from their arm. I always bow and smile, asking, ldquo;Can I taste one of your fruits? Bananas from a skin-tree are so sweet.rdquo;

So sweet and so small, a single mouthful.

I also enjoy the place where banana tree meets flesh, roots curving over and into the personrsquo;s limb -- pressing my lips there, my tongue -- and the small shade cast by the leaves.

Kim Cuc saw advertisements everywhere she looked in the walking street market, but only on the leaves of the skin-trees: names of shops and cafeacute;s and restaurants spelled out, Thai or English or other languages, in the bright white veins. Aside from the occasional cry from stall owners or vendors -- ldquo;I have the finest grilled bananas in Chiang Mai! Come and taste!rdquo; -- no other form of promotion cluttered the senses.

That had always been the intent of the skin-treesrsquo; engineers and earliest supporters. Kim Cuc smiled often, seeing the remains of once-garishly lit billboards, or walls that several years earlier would have been covered in paper.

No smiles on this night.

She stopped every person with a skin-tree in the walking street market, to ask if theyrsquo;d noticed strange discolourations on their leaves. ldquo;There is a sickness,rdquo; she said, putting urgency into the phrase she now knew in many languages, not just her native Vietnamese and second tongue English, ldquo;and itrsquo;s important to collect samples and data.rdquo; Into one of the notebooks carried under her arm, she noted the age and ethnicity of the person, the age and species of their tree, the company its leaves advertised -- this for those whose trees remained healthy. In a second notebook, with frowning lizards on the spine, she noted the same information for those whose trees were not. There she added information about the duration of the discolourations, their colour and spread. Samples went into a third notebook, with little clips to fasten two pages together, and special paper to protect and preserve the leaves.

The lizard-spined notebook was not as full as the first, yet.

Late in the night, when vendors began packing away their wares, Kim Cuc followed the shoppers returning to their homes. She drank from the large bottle of nutrient-full water she always carried around. The durian tree growing on her left shoulder needed it.

She passed a stall selling Buddha-shaped lanterns, a popular tourist item. Some still glowed, yellowly and redly, and in their light she glanced at her durian. A brown circle, no greater in circumference than a joss stick, lay on the edge of one leaf.

ldquo;No!rdquo; she cried out.

The bright screen of her wrist-computer did not contradict the Buddha lights.

BANYAN

The banyanrsquo;s thick roots suggest a secret fluidity, like wax, uncommon to plants: frozen over Pitsamairsquo;s shoulder, beginning where bone used to jut from her thin flesh, sliding down her shoulder blades, curling around her upper arm (carefully trained not to restrict movement), stretching across her collarbone and down her breastbone, down the neat lines of her ribs. They frame her right breast. I always think they will flow when Pitsamai is alone, even though she tells me this isnrsquo;t the case.

The thick leaves advertise Chiang Mai University. Veins curl in the letters in Thai and English, artificially white against dark green. Pitsamai loves her university.

The tangled trunks rise from her shoulder, a...</ns2:summary>

		<ns2:summary>Quick note: Sorry it's late folks, minor illness-related delays.

The ePub version can be foundnbsp;here.

To our readersmdash;

Irsquo;ve always been of two minds about that proverb (well, curse) that has been attributed to the ancient Chi- nese of ldquo;May you live in interesting times.rdquo;

Because letrsquo;s face it, boring times are getting further apart and fewer. The era of the noble farmer living a quiet life on the plains is long dead in much of the developed world, and while we always dream of re- turning home to a quiet Ithaca, I think a lot of us prefer the torrents of the seas and not knowing what the next isle will bring.

Which is bit of a long way of saying that it was a bit of a crazy month last month, wasnrsquo;t it?

Thousands of much better words than these have been etched in the cyber on the wave of popular revolu- tions in North Africa and the Middle East, so Irsquo;m going talk about the impending end of the Space Shuttle program.

Space shuttles were always a bit of science fiction that existed in the real world for those of us who grew up after the space race. They were the oddly shaped white space ships in the toy box with the X and Y- Wings and variants of the Enterprise.

They mixed the aspiration of escape from the bonds of gravity with the weight of tragedy that such aspira- tion can lead to. They were something between a pickup truck and the first real wave of space colonizers. Not that the two are mutually exclusive

The third to last shuttle mission is skimming the stratosphere as I write this, and the last one is due to launch in June. And then the US civilian space program will be reliant on private sector for space vehicles until at least 2015. Which, in a way, is progress.

But progress that doesnrsquo;t quite sit right. You want commercial haulers out there making space civilized, useful, and cheap enough that you might be able to hop out there for less than a decadersquo;s salary. But therersquo;s a need for ships of the line, and those come from the public masses.

Last month, Escape Pod brought you four stories, two of which will be republished here. Unfortunately we bought EP279: Conditional Love just before we started asking for ePub rights, as it was just nominated for the Nebula. Escape Pod knows all, but not always at the right time.

But we are bringing you the excellent David D. Levinersquo;s Written On The Wind and the quite interesting Alex Dally MacFarlanersquo;s The Notebook of My Favorite Skin-Trees. Onersquo;s about a bunch of aliens living together, mostly in peace, and the otherrsquo;s about advertising in the near future.

We also did something a little special with the Written On The Wind episode, and you can read about it in the back of this monthrsquo;s Soundproof.
Yours,
mdash;Bill</ns2:summary>

Yoursquo;re Almost Here
by Melinda Thielbar
 
ldquo;Can I share your table?rdquo;

You look up to see your dream girl. Red hair, cream-colored skin, face just a little round, breasts just a little small. Not movie-star beautiful, not perfect just--nice. She smiles, and her cheeks dimple, and yoursquo;re in love. You gesture to the empty chair across from you with a grin of your own.

ldquo;Be my guest,rdquo; you say.

ldquo;Thanks.rdquo; She takes the chair and sets her coffee cup down. You close the notebook in front of you and open your mouth to say somethingmdash;anythingmdash;to impress this girl.
 
Without looking at you, she turns in her chair, pulls a phone out of her pocket and bends over it. You watch her face in profile as she slips a pair of earbuds into her ears. Your mouth is still open, so you close it and look away. Thatrsquo;s when you see that every table is occupied. Men in suits, women in suits, a few people your age in khakis or jeans. Theyrsquo;re all looking down at their phones, laptops, or handheld game consoles. Sunlight streams in through the floor-to-ceiling windows, and you watch people passing by on the street for a minute. Theyrsquo;re all looking straight ahead, faces set the way they have to be in a city this size. When itrsquo;s this crowded, the only privacy you can give a stranger is not to notice them. That idea interests you, and so you open your notebook to jot it down at the bottom of the second-to-last page. As yoursquo;re writing, a chair scrapes behind you, and a guy in a navy three-piece moves past. He flips his phone open and then closed again, checking the time, and hurries out.
 
The girl across from you moves almost as fast as he does. ldquo;Thanks,rdquo; she says and flashes that amazing smile again before she grabs her drink and hops to the newly-open table. You write FUCK across the top of the second-to-last page of your notebook, tuck it into your pocket, and go get another coffee.

The barristomatic (you call it this; no one else does), takes your thumbprint and opens a menu with your recent drink selections. Theyrsquo;re supposed to be sorted so the one you drink most is at the top. For you, it might as well be random. You do something different every time. This onersquo;s a half-pump vanilla, half-pump strawberry, soy milk latte with a lousy espresso bean that still costs more than all the other ingredients put together because itrsquo;s fair-trade and organic. You once enumerated every combination, ranked them from most to least expensive an...</ns2:summary>

Grandfather Paradox
by Katherine Mankiller

JUNE 23, 1994

Ann stuffed her blood-spattered clothes into the next door apartment complex's dumpster.  He wasn't dead, but it was harder to get a knife through someone's chest than she'd expected.  Maybe he'd bleed to death before someone found him.  She didn't care either way.  She was a juvenile, so it wasn't like she was going to fry.

She walked.  The YMCA was open.  She locked herself in the men's room, curled up on the floor, and fell asleep.

The next morning, she stopped at an IHOP and told a grey-haired waitress, "I don't have any money, but can I have a cup of coffee?" The waitress must have felt sorry for her:  she bought her breakfast. Afterwards, she went to Safeway and hid a steak and a bottle of beer under her coat and walked out.  And kept walking.  Someone had a barbecue grill in their back yard.  She took it, and the charcoal, too.

What she could really go for now was some mushrooms.  She should swipe some Kool-Aid and find a cow pasture.  Or maybe she could rob a veterinary clinic.  Anything to get the thought of him touching her out of her head, and that beer wasn't going to cut it.

Steak and beer.  Almost luxurious.

The sign read "Open House."  Yes, that sounded about perfect.  She spent the night there, on the carpet smelling faintly of shampoo.

It had happened to him, too.  What her father had done to her, his father had done to him.  Which, in her opinion, just made it worse. He knew what it was like.

When the police arrived and told her she was under arrest for murder, she couldn't stop laughing.

JANUARY 4, 2014

The crane lifted the sealed concrete container out of the hole in the ground.  Ann lay down in the snow next to the hole and reached inside.  "My arms are too short," she said.

Martin lay down next to her.

"Excuse me?" Dr. Chandler, the president of the university, said.

"I'm sorry," Martin said.  "I thought my department chair had spoken to you.  Martin Robbins, physics.  My head programmer, Ann O'Connell. Please, continue."

Dr. Chandler gave them a dirty look, then walked over to the microphone.  "This time capsule was sealed in 1914.  The items inside represent what they wanted us to know about the past.  I'm sure our history department is hoping I'll cut the speech short and let them get at it..."

There was a chuckle from the crowd.

"Got it," Martin said.  He pulled out a grimy Tyvek envelope, and opened it.  Inside, there was a penny dated 2013.  Martin smiled at her.  "Looks like our own time capsule arrived intact."

FEBRUARY 9, 2014

"How are you feeling today, Ann?"  Dr. Katz asked.  Her glasses were perched precariously on her nose, and her bun was in danger of falling down.

Screw her.  "Is my hour up yet?"

"No."

Fine.  Be that way.

"How are things going with Martin?"

"I stopped dating Martin."

"Why?"

"Because he wanted to sleep with me.  It was awful.  Ugh."

Dr. Katz was giving Ann that psychiatrist look.  Well, Ann had felt like she had to.  Saying no would be rude.  Well, not rude, but... Anyway, no more Martin.  She'd had her phone number changed, and if he came around again?  Restraining order.  Work the system, or the system works you.

"How does that affect your job?" Dr. Katz asked.

"I have vacation time," Ann said.  "I took it."

Dr. Katz looked like she felt sorry for</ns2:summary>

On a Clear Day You can See All the Way to Conspiracy
by Desmond Warzel

You're listening to the Mike Colavito Show on Cleveland's home for straight talk, WCUY 1200. The opinions expressed on this program do not reflect those of WCUY, its management, or its sponsors.

Fair warning; I'm in a mood today, folks.

We've got a mayor whose only talent seems to be showing up at luncheons and waving at the cameras.

Eighty bucks I had to pay yesterday for not wearing my seatbelt. Show me the seatbelts on a school bus.

I saw a Cleveland athlete on national TV last night wearing a Yankees cap.

And every day I get at least a dozen calls from schmucks who think that people like me are the problem in this city.

Tell me America's not falling apart.

[pause]

And some of you people--including our programming director, by the way--seem to think I'm running my mouth too much and not taking enough phone calls. I've only been number one in radio in this city for ten straight years; what would I know?

You want calls? You got 'em. Steven in Mayfield Heights, you're on the air.

"Hey, what's up, Mike?"

The rent. Art in Seven Hills, you're on WCUY.

"How you doing, Mike. Just wondering if you caught that ball game last night?"

No. Andrea in Rocky River, go ahead.

"Hi, Mike, first-time caller."

Well, call back tomorrow and you'll be a second-time caller. Carol in Cleveland, what's on your mind?

"Mike, what do you think of waterboarding?"

My wife and I waterboard all the time, and it's improved our sex life dramatically. Chuck in Parma, you're on the air.

"Hey, Mike, I heard your show yesterday, and I was just wondering, if you know so much about football, why you don't take over as head coach of the Browns?"

I wouldn't want to take the pay cut. Mina in Lakewood, you're on the air.

"Does your wife think that waterboarding crack was funny?"

Play your cards right some night and you could find out for yourself, Mina. Tommy in Beachwood, you're on WCUY.

"Hi, Mike, just wondering who you think the Indians should try and trade for next year."

Your mother. Jane in Euclid, go ahead.

[pause]

Read More...


Looks like we lost Jane in Euclid. Must have answered her question already. That's all right; we got in seven callers in under a minute. Everyone happy now? Hey, Jake, I have to take a breather; do the traffic.

What?

Oh, yeah. This traffic is brought to you by West Side Hardware.

Thanks, Mike. Not much happening right now; 480, 271, and 77 are all clear, but traffic on the Shoreway is backed up in both directions, so our listeners might want to allow a few extra minutes if they're headed that way. For West Side Hardware, this has been your WCUY traffic report on Cleveland's home for straight talk.

Hey, Jake, don't go yet. You still there? I gotta take the Shoreway home after the show. Any idea what the holdup is?

Can't say, Mike; no accidents, just a general slowdown all along the lakeshore.

Wonderful.

And people wonder why I'm always giving the mayor grief. Straightest stretch of highway in America, and traffic still won't move. Somebody on the Shoreway, call in and tell me what the hell's going on over there. Franklin in Cleveland, you're on the air.

"What's up, Mike? You gonna let me talk?"

Don't worry, it's all out of my system. The floor's yours.

"Well, you're entitled to your opinion about the mayor, but come on, man, how you gonna blame him for slow traffic?"

The traffic's just a symptom. I'm talking about neglect. Name me one thing the mayor's accomplished since he took office.

"Well--"

You can't, Franklin, beca</ns2:summary>

Jaiden's Weaver
by Mary Robinette Kowal

I was never one of those girls who fell in love with horses. For one thing, on our part of New Oregon they were largely impractical animals. Most of the countryside consisted of forests attached to sheer hills and you wanted to ride something with a little more clinging ability. So from the time I was, well, from the time I can remember I wanted a teddy bear spider more than I wanted to breathe.

The problem is that teddy bear spiders were not cheap, especially not for a pioneer family trying to make a go of it.

Mom and Dad had moved us out of Landington in the first wave of expansion, to take advantage of the homesteading act. Our new place was way out on the eastern side of the Olson mountains where Dad had found this natural level patch about halfway up a forested ridge, so we got sunshine all year round, except for the weeks in spring and autumn when the shadow of our planet's rings passed over us. Our simple extruded concrete house had nothing going for it except a view of the valley, which faced due south to where the rings were like a giant arch in the sky. Even as a twelve-year-old, angry at being taken away from our livewalls in town to this dead structure, I fell in love with the wild beauty of the trees clinging to the sheer faces of the valley walls.

The only thing that would have made it better was a teddy bear spider so I could go exploring on my own. I felt trapped by the walls of the house and the valley. I had this dream that, if I had a spider, that I'd be able to sell its weavings for enough to install livewalls in my room. That's not as crazy as it sounds; teddy-bear spider weavings are collected all over the colonies and sell for insane amounts of money.

I had a search setup so anytime there was news of a teddy bear spider or a new tube surfaced, I'd be right there, watching those adorable long-legged beasts. I loved their plump furry faces and wanted to run my fingers through their silky russet fur.

I wonder what goes through a survey team's mind when they name things. I mean a teddy bear spider isn't a bear and it isn't a spider, but it looks like both those things. On the other hand, a fartycat looks nothing like a cat. They do stink, though.

Not quite a year after we'd moved, one of my city friends had forwarded an ad from a local board which set my heart to racing.

Teddy bear spider eggs: 75NOD shipped direct.

Read More...

See, I'd been looking at adult or adolescent teddies which cost more than my folks had set aside for me to go to university. It hadn't even occurred to me that I could raise one up myself. My mindless yearning changed into purpose.

I slapped that ad onto a piece of epaper and ran into the kitchen. "Dad! Mom! Look at this."

Dad glanced up from the eggs he was cracking into a bowl and pursed his lips the way he always did right before saying _no._ "Jaiden, that's a lot of money."

I waved the ad again as if it were a token to get me on a ride at the fair. "We'd make back the money when the teddy started to weave. Please? I've seen their weavings in stores for hundreds of NOD."
Mom ganged up on me. "That's how much the store sells a weaving for, it's not how much they pay for them. Even if it were, you're not just talking the cost of the eggs. It's the cost of feeding it, housing it, vet bills..."

I knew better than to keep arguing. Sometimes if I waited and tried again later, I could get them to change their minds. Still holding the ad, I went outside and plopped on the log bench Dad had made for the front of the house. The broad silver band of the ring spanned the sky, blocked by only a few clouds.</ns2:summary>

		<description>Apocalypse fiction has been around for many years, usually in the form of a cataclysmic event that destroys a good chunk of the entire planet. After reading &lt;i&gt;Soft Apocalypse&lt;/i&gt;, I can tell you that being eaten by a giant space squid is far more palatable than what author Will McIntosh foresees.</description>

The rsquo;76 Goldwater Dime
By John Medaille

I started in 1962, thatrsquo;s when I became a numismatist. You know what that is? Itrsquo;s the study ofhellip;.well, itrsquo;s not the study of anything. Itrsquo;s coin collecting, is what it is.

I was ten in 1962, and Christmas I got my first coin album. I didnrsquo;t actually get it. My father gave it to my brother. It was, you know, yoursquo;ve seen them, a sturdy cardboard folder with slots punched out that you put the coins in. Behind the slots, the empties, it had a backing of blue felt, I remember that. My dad gave it to my brother, I guess maybe thinking it would straighten him out. But coins, you know, they donrsquo;t really have that power. He wasnrsquo;t interested. He gave it to me. Me, I was interested.

The album was for Lincoln pennies, 1909 to 1959. I had five cents in the world then and each of the five fit in the slot. It only took me five more days to get the other forty-five. I would do anything for those pennies and slot it in its slot. Anything, anything. When I got my last penny, wow. It was a 1943 steel mint penny, a lsquo;steelie.rsquo; They had to use steel instead of copper that year cause they needed the copper for all the bombs. I was so proud.

From then on it was just coins for me. My life was coins. I was hooked. They had their hooks in me, boy.

When I was just seventeen I moved by myself down to Washington, DC, cause I got a job there in a coin shop. That was my education. I lived in a one room dungeon in a crumby neighborhood, I loved coins that much.

You know, and I do alright. I made my living. I own my own house. I donrsquo;t live in debt like everybody else does. Thatrsquo;s what coins did for me. Coins and specie and spec. I donrsquo;t care for paper money, it holds nothing for me.

Me, Irsquo;m a specialist. I know generalists, I do business with them, I have to. And speculators, sure. You do what you need to do to survive in the world. But me, Irsquo;m a specialist and my friends are specialists. Irsquo;ll give an example, I have a friend, he died. But before he died, his specialty was pay toilet tokens. I mean, have you ever seen a pay toilet? In your life? I saw some once in Europe but I donrsquo;t even know if they have them there anymore. Anyway, this friend of mine, he spends his life collecting these tokens, these coins, for pay toilets, from around the world and every age. He finds the obscurest pay toilet tokens there are and theyrsquo;re his. And then he dies alone in his apartment with these thousands of toilet tokens around him. I mean, thatrsquo;s the way to go. I mean that. To have these objects of joy around you. To you and me, they are not objects of joy, but to him they are. You know, not everybody gets to have that, itrsquo;s not something that everyone receives. To have such pleasure from these things, these old things. But he does and I do because, see, wersquo;re specialists. Not everybody understands that.

Other people I know, you know, have their special collections. Any thing you can think of, any given thing and therersquo;s some guy like me out there obsessed with it. I know people, you meet a lot of interesting people in this business, whose specialties are Depression era wooden nickels or peep show tokens, or misprint coins, error coins, or brockage, thatrsquo;s coins with mirror image stamps on both sides, or obverses or lsquo;Godless Dollars.rsquo; You ever heard of lsquo;Godless Dollars?rsquo; Those are dollar coins where the ldquo;In God we trustrdquo; part got left off. Now, you see, I respect that. Those are people with specialties. They are connoisseurs, like me. Not any old crap will do.

Welcome to April! mdash;

March was a sad month worldwide, and I, frankly, am looking forward to leaving winter behind. (Yeah, I know March starts spring in the Northern Hemisphere, but the damp and dank weather wersquo;ve been having the US South makes me feel more like winter than January did.)

First, the world was shocked by the disasters in Japan, earthquake, tsunami, and the continuing threat of radiation from their nuclear plant.

Then fantasy lost one of its masters with the death of Diana Wynne Jones. Any fan or writer of fantasy needs to read her Tough Guide to Fantasyland, and, well, any of her other books. Thirdlyhellip;

Well, hell, isnrsquo;t that enough?

Many people find themselves feeling lost and useless when it comes to disasters, especially if theyrsquo;re happening far away. Luckily, some very quick and innovative SFF fans and professionals (including Pseudopodrsquo;s own Alasdair Stuart) got together to create Genre for Japan ( http://genreforjapan.wordpress.com/ ), an auction featuring signed books from authors, collections of books from publishers (like Tor and Angry Robot), and editing or critique services from agents and editors. All proceeds go to the Japan Tsunami Appeal run by the British Red Cross. (They know what theyrsquo;re doing.) Give generously and you can get some awesome prizes.

We hope yoursquo;re enjoying the monthly Soundproof PDFs.

We have had gotten a couple of questions asking why some of our audio stories donrsquo;t get printed on the site or in the Soundproof. The answer is simple: we donrsquo;t have the rights.

We buy the audio and ebook rights to all stories we are able to, but sometimes we are only able to get the audio rights, so those stories are in our audio feed. As we move forward we will do everything we can to get both ebook and audio rights.

Herersquo;s to a better month.

A Taste of Time
by Abby Goldsmith

1.

On the night she turned twenty-nine, Jane sat on her narrow bed, watching TV and drinking alone.  She'd gone through a bottle of wine and was mostly through a second bottle.  Tomorrow morning would be painful.

Or she could stop worrying about tomorrow.  The ibuprofen in her cabinet kept popping into her mind.  Jane wasn't sure if all those pills chased by alcohol would be enough to end her life, but the idea of looking up how to commit suicide online seemed just too pathetic.

The front door of her tiny apartment creaked open.

Jane leaned forward, peering through her bedroom doorway.  A black wine bottle stood on the floor, with a placard dangling from its silver ribbon.

Her gaze immediately went to the deadbolt.  It was in place, as she'd left it.

Jane shut the TV off and listened for noises from the hallway.  All she heard were the sounds of Boston traffic outside.  Several weeks ago, after she'd come home to find her boyfriend screwing a fat chick on her couch, shersquo;d had the locks changed.  No one could have gotten in.

Yet the bottle sat mysteriously on the wooden floor.

At last, Jane crossed her apartment, checking every shadow for an intruder.

She picked up the bottle.  The placard had gilded letters, making it a potentially expensive gift.

Tabula Rasa
Warning: There Is No Return

Jane flipped the placard over twice, but nothing else was written on it.

She listened, alert for any noise.  Mystery had never been much a part of her adult life, and it gave her a strangely excited feeling.  If the warning label meant something like _poison_, it seemed like a more dignified way to go than pills and alcohol.

Her reflection on the black surface of the bottle was disturbingly clear.  There she was: Plain Jane, a frumpy woman with a double-chin and acne scars.

She unscrewed the cap and popped the foil underneath.  A stringent smell wafted up, making her wrinkle her nose and salivate at the same time.

"Happy birthday, Jane," she told herself, and swallowed a mouthful.

2.

Jane gagged on the sour taste in her mouth.  She was so dizzy, she'd fallen . . . but she was sitting in an office chair, with no memory whatsoever of leaving her dark and quiet apartment.

Florescent lights beat down on her, and the familiar voices of a call center surrounded her.  None of this was possible.  She was back at her old workplace.  It was a workday, late afternoon, judging by the angle of light.  Ultimata Insurance had laid her off months ago, yet here she was.

A man rapped his knuckles against Jane's desk.  "I gave you the files you needed, right?"  Her old boss, Moore, didn't bother to wait for a reply.  He was always in a hurry.  Jane barely started to nod before he rushed away.

The walls of her cubicle looked exactly the way she remembered.  There was the photograph of herself and mom.  There was the generic Ultimata calendar, flipped to October 2009 . . . Jane double-checked the year. 2009 was a full two years before the company downsized.  If this was October 2009, then she was still employed.

And still dating the jerk, Aaron.

Her fists tightened, and she realized that her hand was clamped around the black wine bottle.  She might lose her job more quickly this time, if they saw that.  She hid it beneath her desk.

"Jane!"

Jane swiveled to face Stephanie, who worked in the cubicle across from hers.  Stephanie was slim with bouncy golden hair, and never deigned to speak to plain Jane.

Stephanie hurried across into Jane's cubicle, giving a sneaky look both ways before crossing.  She beamed at Jane.  "...</ns2:summary>

Future Perfect
By LaShawn M. Wanak

I saw you at a party once. You stood by the bookshelf, reading a tattered volume on Proust. You wore an orange and yellow XTC shirt beneath brown flannel. I bumped your elbow by accident and you looked up, your eyes startling green.

I smiled and said, "Hi. I'm Nina."

"Hi. Eric."

I trailed behind you for the rest of the party. You introduced me to your friends and I laughed at their jokes. Twice, our sleeves brushed against each other.

Around two in the morning, you left with your friends. An hour later, I also left. I crossed the empty campus, humming under my breath, wondering if I'd ever see you again.

The watch on my arm beeped.

*

"This experiment will measure how small changes occurring before a certain event affect its outcome positively and negatively."

The chair is her creation. She bought the frame on impulse at a medical supply shop. The conical helmet, perforated with slender tubes, fits on top. Whenever she maneuvers her head beneath it, she thinks of the hair dryers at her mother's beauty salon. All those bulky astronaut bonnets lined in perfect rows, vibrating air molecules to a feverish pitch. She likes this scientific homage to her mother extracting time from thin air.

"Recording of the control event complete. Setting a change in a condition set slightly in the past. The goal of this first jump is to see if this will change the outcome of the event to a more positive circumstance."

She types on the laptop built into the armrest, then glances at the elaborate flowchart tacked upon the far wall of the laboratory. Written in
her own hand, neat and precise, equations and sums branch and connect like a roadmap of a probability highway.

She wonders which formula will have his lips pressing against hers.

"Test #1. Begin."

I saw you at a party once. You stood next to Muriel, hair rumpled, clothes wrinkled. I had my hair permed that morning so it hung straight over my eyes. I wore tight-fitting jeans and a blue top with spaghetti straps.

I didn't speak to you, just hung out with a couple of my girlfriends. When "Atomic Dog" came on the stereo, I shimmied to the bookcase, shaking my hips and wiggling my butt. Only then I noticed you, you and your startling green eyes. You smiled and said, "Hi, there." Muriel looked over and pulled you from the room.

Later, while getting punch, I looked out the window and saw you and Muriel standing on the sidewalk below. She cupped your face, pulling it down to meet hers. I thought, Shame. He had nice eyes.

Then someone stepped on my foot and I swore, loudly. As the guy next to me apologized, the watch on my arm beeped.

You went on to have three children with Muriel. It took several years until I said yes to Brenton.

*

She rises from the chair, pulling the sensors from her body. She takes a sip of lukewarm coffee and frowns at the chart on the wall.

The outcome remained the same, but that was to be expected. With so many variables, it will take time to narrow down the finite set of outcomes, both positive and negative. She isn't worried; after all, only two possible outcomes can come from this event.

She picks up a black magic marker and crosses off a number with an 'X'.

*

We came to the party together, your arm slung around my shoulders. You and I had met several weeks before. Within a week, we were dating. Within six weeks, we were an 'item'.

Muriel was there as well, dancing alone by the bookshelves. Though my hand was buried in your back pocket, you couldn't tear your eyes from her. I distracted you by pulling you over to introduce my friends. You nodded, laughed at someone's joke and glanced towards the corner.

Brenton asked if the punchbowl ne</ns2:summary>

Episode 37 - Captain Max Stone versus DESTRUCTOBOT!
 By Angela Lee
Read by: Joshua McNichols

When last we left our heroes, Captain Max Stone and his brother Billy had just navigated Hyperion's perilous asteroid field and battled their way into the fortified base of the villainous robot Destructobot.  The dastardly robot's latest scheme is the deadliest yet - he intends to destroy the Earth using a high-powered negabomb!  Will Max stop Destructobot in time? Or will the earth be vaporized?

Many Mistakes, All Out of Order

The first mistake was in our thinking they were ghosts.  In our defense, the tradition of vanishing, translucent figures wailing in the night mightrsquo;ve influenced us.

Mr. Omega checked the time on his trans-dimensional pocket watch and stared out the taxirsquo;s rain pelted window.  Four minutes to midnight.  Four minutes to the culmination of his lifersquo;s work.</ns2:summary>

Zoo City explores a present day, but alternate, Johannesburg, and  follows the story of Zinzi December, one of the animalled ndash; people who  are psychically bonded with animals due to crimes they have committed in  the past.nbsp;Zinzi has a talent for finding lost things, but when she is  asked to take on a missing persons case, her life becomes increasingly  more complicated and she discovers that beneath the seedy underbelly  ofnbsp;Zoo City, things can - and do - get a lot worse.

Rated PG-13 for talk of sex workers and street violence.

Tom the Universe
by Larry Hodges

I permeate this universe, which  I've named Tom, and guard against its destruction. If someone had done that for  the universe I came from, then Mary, my sweet Mary, would still be alive, and I wouldn't have killed her and everyone else when I accidentally destroyed that  universe.

And now I'm on the verge of destroying much more.

My name is also Tom. I was an  undergrad in neuroscience at Johns  Hopkins University in Baltimore that January in 2040 when I made the  discovery that doomed us all. My field of study was cognitive science, the study  of human consciousness. What makes us aware of ourselves? Is it just the  biomechanical workings of the brain, or something else?

Sherlock Holmes said, "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the  truth." I spent countless hours in the lab eliminating the impossible, and there  didn't seem to be anything left, improbable or not. The interconnectivity  required for human consciousness to exist was just too many levels beyond what  was possible. By all rights, we should all be unconscious blobs of matter  mechanically going about our business as directed by electronic impulses from  the brain, with no more consciousness than a calculator. I suffered brain cramps  in the lab trying to figure out what improbables were left.

When I could think of nothing else to try, it was time to relax and let my subconscious figure it out. So I got out the Frisbee and called my lab partners.

Mary, Joey, and I--Tommy, as they called me--called ourselves the "ees."  I'd only met Mary when we'd started college, and adored how she laughed when I  explained my love for her in neurological terms, with dopamine and  neurotransmitters. We did everything together, or so I thought; classes and  labs, movies, and late-night bull sessions with pizza and ice cream, usually  followed by pints of morning coffee. Our future together was assured; as soon as  we graduated, we would get married. I'd even convinced her we should wear purity  rings--I had special ones made up with a brain emblem.

Joey and I grew up together on the same street, playing stickball and  videogames. He and I were going to be buddies for life.

Professor Wilson, our adviser, reluctantly let the three of us be lab  partners even though he said it's best not to put friends together. Amazingly,  we got a lot done when we weren't reading the neurology cartoons taped to the  walls or playing with Catzilla, the lab's iguana-bodied, cat-brained hybrid  mascot. And then came that morning when we went outside the lab on Charles Street to  toss the Frisbee around among the oak trees by the front steps. The fresh air  was an escape from the antiseptic stench of the lab.

"You throw like a girl!" Joey said when my toss to him banged against the  ground, way off line. He stood half a head taller than me, with that eternal  mischievous grin I'd known for twenty years. He was the only person in the world  who could get away with a ponytailed bouffant, which I would yank every  chance.

"Like a girl, huh?" Mary said, throwing the Frisbee as hard as she could  at Joey, who barely blocked it. Mary grabbed the rebound and faked another throw  while Joey cringed. "Want some more?" She was my sweet pixie, five feet of tiger  and spice, never still, never silent. Recently she'd taken to tying her long  blond hair in a ponytail like Joey, giving me a second target to yank. I was the  smart one, with a crew cut.

"Okay," Joey said, "you win. You both throw like girls!" Mary smacked  him with the frisbee again.

As we tossed it around, I became aware of my awareness of the Frisbee's location at any given moment. Somehow my mind tracked this and so many other  thi</ns2:summary>

Hello Allmdash;

We have listeners all over, and some of them will be heading into the winter months, but where I am spring has finally shook off the claws of winter.

But in the slice of science fiction fandom we all inhabit, spring is really notable for the return of Doctor Who to the airwaves, and thankfully for US fans, it is far closer to simultaneous transmission now that it has been the last few seasons. Physical distance matters less and less for communication, which in practice means that it is incredibly annoying to be in the US and looking at a twitter stream full of UK tweets about what the Doctorrsquo;s been on about that week. Spoilers suck (sweetie).

And speaking of the UK, we were very lucky and happy to run an interview with Lauren Beukes, who won this yearrsquo;s Arthur C. Clarke award for her novel Zoo City. Itrsquo;s available in an audio episode on our website, along with a (still audio) excerpt from thenbsp; book.

This month we were happy to bring you six stories, three of them flash. We ran three of the four honorable mentions from our flash contest fiction, which we should have done well before this. The forth and the three outright winners of the contest should be following in fairly close order.

We also brought you Abby Goldsmithrsquo;s A Taste Of Time, LaShawn Wanakrsquo;s Future Perfect, and Larry Hodgesrsquo; Tom the Universe. If you didnrsquo;t already listen to the on the lsquo;cast, I implore you to flick, scroll, click, or otherwise navigate several pages further in this to read them.

Until next month,

In the Water
by Katherine Mankiller

Yvonne looked up from her monitor, the beads in her cornrows clattering as Roger walked into her office.

Roger sat in the dark wooden chair opposite her desk.  "Weren't you assigned Alice van Buuren?"

"Oh, no you don't," Yvonne said.  "You can't have her."  Yvonne hadn't been assigned Alice; she'd requested her.  Alice was probably the only murder victim's wife she would ever meet. They hadn't even put the murder in the papers.  Maybe they thought there'd be a panic.

"Please," Roger said.  "I'm just trying to save you some trouble. I've already spoken to her, and..."

Yvonne crossed her arms and glared.  "Wouldn't you raise hell if I talked to one of your patients behind your back?"

"She's refusing modern therapy.  What are you going to do, use the old-fashioned techniques your grandmother used?"

Roger had a lot of nerve mentioning Grandma.  Yvonne glanced at the photo on the corner of her desk.  Grandma Jackson had been a big woman, with braids down to her hips and skin like chocolate.  Grandma Jackson smiled back at the camera, all reassuring good nature.

Roger said, "I think we should just wipe her and have done with it."

"Too bad she's not your patient," Yvonne said.



"I could take her away from you, you know."

"Don't you dare!"

There was an awkward silence.

"It'll be less confusing for her if I come with you," Roger said. "Just to hand her off to you.  You understand."

"Fine," Yvonne said.  "Whatever."

"Good girl," Roger said, and Yvonne gritted her teeth.  "Room 314." He stood.  "Let's go."

"Now?" Yvonne said.  She picked up her coffee and almost took a sip, then put it down again, making a face.  It was cold, and it had been so bitter hot that she'd taken caffeine pills with orange juice instead.

Roger snorted.  "That bad?"

Roger clearly wasn't going anywhere, so Yvonne stood, picked up her jacket, and followed Roger out of her office.  The halls were white to the point of being blinding after her calm, earth-toned office, and reeked of disinfectant.

They went upstairs and over to room 314.  Roger placed his hand on the identification plate and the door slid open.

"Hello, Alice," Roger said.

The patient, a skinny, pale woman with brown hair, backed away from Roger.  She reminded Yvonne of someone, although she couldn't put her finger on whom.

The patient fell into a seated position on the bed, mouth open, staring at Yvonne.  Before Yvonne could say anything, Roger said, "This is Doctor Jackson.  Doctor Jackson, this is Alice."

"We're not going to hurt you," Yvonne said.

The patient--Alice--stared at Yvonne for a moment, then shut her mouth.  She shot Roger a defiant look.

"I'll just leave you to it," Roger said, and left.

"Hello, Alice," Yvonne said.  "You can call me Yvonne if you prefer."

"We've met," Alice said.  It wasn't a question.

Alice really did look familiar. "Refresh my memory?"

"It doesn't matter," Alice said and looked away.

There was an uncomfortable silence.

Yvonne said, "Dr. Hill said you're refusing drug therapy."

"I had a negative reaction once," Alice said.

"Really?" Yvonne said.  "Usually that's associated with an interaction with an unapproved drug.  You should be fine this time; your blood tests came back clean."

"I wasn't on anything then, either," Alice said.

"That's very unusual," Yvonne said.

Alice shrugged.  "Just weird, I guess."

A Small Matter, Really
By  Monte Cook

Only the Catholic Church of Osirus would have enough money to afford not one, but two black holes.  Standing within the majestic narthex, Maria McNaki imagined the vibration of  complex machinery under her feet, despite the fact that the nanosensors laced  into her flesh revealed nothing other than the passing of the people in the  crowd and the chanting coming from deeper within the  cathedral.

The stone walls of the  chamber slowly flowed with a liquid relief of gothic circuitry and religious  hieroglyphic animations. The glyph depicting Setan as he tore the crucified  Osirus-Christ into tiny fragments malfunctioned and remained static. Just as  well. The petitioners around her made carefully devout hand signs over their  hearts as they faced the ankh crucifix over the door into the  sanctuary.

Religion was back in  fashion this season.

Three identical priests  stood next to the holy water fonts, welcoming the incoming congregation. Their  white collars and black robes stood starched-still. Geneticists form-shaped all  Catholic-Osirus priests into the gentle, fatherly form selected by church PR,  but these three were special. The bright eyes and the shining hair indicated Aesthicel, the most expensive genengineering firm in the Earth system. This  parish liked to spend money.

Perfect. That most  likely meant that they were interested in obtaining more.



Terrence told her that  the facility lay underneath the cathedral. Maria made her way past the incoming  worshipers as quickly and politely as she could.

Stout-of-Heart mewled  behind her, trying to keep up. The alienrsquo;s appearance disturbed a few in the  crowd, and Maria realized that bringing him might not have been the best idea  after all. The four-foot, shaggy bramagian bore the minder headband that marked  him as a trained urban bodyguard, but his claws and tusks still instilled fear  in many humans. The headband also allowed the creature to access a private data  field that existed only between the two of them. Through it, Maria could  communicate with him. Nevertheless, she preferred it much better when Piotr had  tended to the bramagian.

ldquo;Lord, what is this  place?rdquo; Stout-of-Heart asked her. She hated being called Lord, but the  bramagians were so fiercely misogynistic that it was best if they thought of all  humans as male. Maria had no idea how to explain the church to Stout-of-Heart.  Bramagians taken by humans from their homeworld already believed that they were  in Heaven, walking among the gods. If she told him that the gods also worshipped  gods, it might be too much for him. Among the bramagians, madness was a fate  worse than death.

ldquo;Never mind,  Stout-of-Heart,rdquo; she uploaded into their link. ldquo;Itrsquo;s too difficult to explain.rdquo;  Her assurances would only work for so long. Although the aliens were happy to be  warriors in Heaven, they were intensely curious about everything they  encountered there.

Elevator doors stood  closed to the right of the sanctuary entrance. More boy than man, a guard stood  in front of them, arms folded as if he could possibly appear menacing. He wore  black robes but no priestly collar and his temple sported a removable receiver  implant. Maria knew better than to be deceived by looks. Muscle-augmentation,  hidden disrupters or even nanite drones could all be concealed. Instead, she  produced her most powerful weapon as she approached the slight guard--a  cashstick keyed to more than this man made in a month.

He stepped aside with a  smile, and the lift doors opened. Maria entered the elevator and whispered ldquo;all  the way down,rdquo; to the man with a smile of her own and a nod. Stout-of-Heart  followed her in, and the doors closed. She smoothed ...</ns2:summary>

The Night Train
By Lavie Tidhar

Her name wasn't Molly and she didn't wear shades, reflective or otherwise.

She was watching the length of the platform.

Hua Lamphong at dusk: a warm wind blowing through the open platforms where the giant beasts puffed smoke and steam into the humid air, the roof of the train station arching high overhead.

Her name wasn't Noi, either, in case you asked, though it's a common enough name. It wasn't Porn, or Ping. It wasn't even Friday.

She was watching the platform, scanning passengers climbing aboard, porters shifting wares, uniformed police patrolling at leisure. She was there to watch out for the Old Man.

She wasn't even a girl. Not exactly. And as for why the Old Man was called the Old Mannbsp;.nbsp;.nbsp;.

He was otherwise known as Boss Gui: head andnbsp;bigfala bos of the Kunming Toads. She got the job when she'd killed Gui's Toad bodyguardsmdash;by default, as it were.

But that had happened back in Kunming. This was Bangkok, Bangkok at duskmdash;this was Hua Lamphong, greatest of train stations, where the great slugs breathed steam and were rubbed and scrubbed by the slug-boys whose job it was to nurture them before departure. And the Old Man wasn't exactly an old man, either.

Scanning, waiting for the Old Man to arrive: Yankee tourists with in-built cams flashing as they posed besides the great beasts, these neo-nagas of reconstituted DNA, primitive nervous system, and prodigious appetite. Scanning: a group of Martian-Chinese from Tong Yun City walking cautiouslymdash;unused to the heavier gravity of this home/planet. Scanning: three Malay businessmenmdash;Earth-Belt Corp. standardized reinforced skeletonsmdash;they moved gracefully, like dancersmdash;wired through and through, hooked up twenty-four Earth-hours an Earth-day, seven Earth-days a week to the money-form engines, the great pulsating web of commerce and data, that singing, Sol-system-wide, von Neumann-machine expanded network of networks of networks.nbsp;.nbsp;.nbsp;.

Wired with hidden weaponry, too: she made a note of that.

An assassin can take many shapes. It could be the sweet old lady carrying two perfectly balanced baskets of woven bamboo over her shoulders, each basket filled with sweet addictive fried Vietnamese bananas. It could be the dapper K-pop starlet with her entourage, ostensibly here to rough it a bit for the hovering cameras. It could be the couple of French backpackersmdash;he with long thinning silver hair and a cigarette between his lips, she with a new face courtesy of Soi Cowboy's front-and-back street cosmetic surgeriesmdash;baby-doll face, but the hands never lie and the hands showed her true age, in the lines etched there, the drying of the skin, the quick-bitten nails polished a cheap redmdash;

An assassin could be anyone. A Yankee rich kid on a retro-trip across Asia, readingnbsp;Air America ornbsp;Neuromancer in a genuine reproduction 1984 POD-paperback; it could be the courteous policeman helping a pretty young Lao girl with her luggage; it could be the girl herselfmdash;an Issan farmer's daughter exported to Bangkok in a century-long tradition, body augmented with vibratory vaginal inserts, perfect audio/visual-to-export, always-on record, a carefully tended Louis Wu habit and an as-carefully-tended retirement planmdash;make enough money, get back home to Issannbsp;wan bigfala mama, open up a bar/hotel/bookshop and spend your days on the Mekong, waxing lyrical about the good old days, listening to Thai pop and K-pop and Nuevo Kwasa-Kwasa, growing misty-eyed nostalgic.nbsp;.nbsp;.nbsp;.

Could be anyone. She waited for the Old Man to arrive. The trains in Hua Lamphong never left on time.

Her name before, or after, doesn't matter. They used to call her Mulan Rouge, whi...</ns2:summary>

		<ns2:summary>From Dave Thompson, the co-editor at our sister podcast, Podcastle:
In late 2007, I took a trip down to San Diego's Conjecture convention. I'd been listening to Escape Pod for a couple of years (PodCastle hadn't even started yet) and so I was thrilled that the very first panel I got to see featured Tim Pratt, Heather Shaw, and Greg van Eekhout. Tim had just won a Hugo for his story "Impossible Dreams" (which I first heard at Escape Pod, yo!) and proceeded to do a collaborative reading of ABC flash fiction. Essentially, they divvied up the alphabet, wrote flash fiction stories for each letter, such as "E is for Excrement" and "N is for Nevermore Nevermore Land." It was a fantastic reading - hilarious, poignant, thrilling, and most of all - they knew how to have fun. I left the convention knowing, just knowing, that one day - this ABC book was going to be big.

But nothing happened. Several years passed, and still - nothing happened.

And then, toward the end of last year - I realized, I'm at Escape Artists, co-editing PodCastle, and that awesome book I remember? Is out there still, and nobody's heard it. So, I talked to Ben Phillips, and then I talked to Tim, Heather, Greg, and Jenn Reese - who came aboard to help them finish up the collection - and we came up with a plan. I decided it'd be awesome to send the Alphabet Quartet out to listeners who'd been kind enough to sign up as paid subscribers or make a one-time donation to us of $50 or more since January 1, 2011. Times are tough, we know, and not everyone can donate, so all the Escape Artists podcasts are going to be sharing a few of these stories with everyone who wants them (and also at the Drabblecast). Additionally, all the stories are available to read there for free at Daily Science Fiction, a great new online magazine that emails you free SF/F stories daily, so everyone wins. Thanks for listening, and we hope you enjoy the extra stories.</ns2:summary>

Hello Gentle Listenersmdash;

May brought us the announcement of the Hugo Awards nominees, which means that June is Hugo Month! For years, Escape Pod has been buying the rights to most of the Hugo short story nominees, and this year is no different. Wersquo;ll be featuring three of the four nominees, and since June has five Thursdays, we will also be featuring two longer stories that got Nebula and/or Hugo nods!

We also have the ebook rights to the stories, which is an Escape Pod first, so next monthrsquo;s Soundproof will be a collectorrsquo;s item. (If a digital file could be collectible. Which it canrsquo;t. So never mind. But you know what I mean; itrsquo;ll be cool.) Irsquo;m very excited to see our site growing so much.

We want to send extra special congrats to the podcasts who managed to make it onto the Hugo Ballot this year! 2010 winner for Best Fanzine, Starship Sofa, has gotten another nomination, and Writing Excuses has received a nod for Best Related Work. SSS has wonderful stories from many masters of SF, and Writing Excuses has wonderful discussions on how to write genre fiction. We are thrilled that these quality podcasts are getting attention from fandom. Irsquo;ll be reporting from WorldCon in two and a half months, and liveblogging the Hugo Awards. More info soon!

A question we get a lot of is, ldquo;Why do you not have all the stories in your PDF?rdquo; The answer is simple- audio and ebook rights are purchased separately, and sometimes an author cannot or will not grant us both rights. Or there are stories wersquo;ve purchased before we started purchasing ebook rights, so we have no right to give you text versions of the stories. We take our authorsrsquo; rights very seriously and will only release the format for which we have rights. Audio-only stories are fewer and fewer these days, but there still will be an occasional one in our future feed.

Speaking of the feed, some people have asked that the Soundproof Escape Pod have its own feed, or the audio have its own feed. Or the R stories to have their own feed. We get this question a lot and canrsquo;t really create custom feeds for each listener - but never fear, there is a solution. Irsquo;d like to point you to a page that gives you some RSS options, including some things you can do to custom make your own EP feed.

From How To Subscribe (http://escapepod.org/subscribe/):

You can make your own special Escape Pod feed by subscribing to http://www.escapepod.org/category/XXXX/feed where you replace XXXX with the category you want to subscribe to. Categories are listed on the front page in a drop-down box on the right. Have at it!

Lastly, in order to get the submissions under control, wersquo;re taking two months off and closing for submissions on June 6th.

We hope you enjoy this issue, chock full of awesome stories, reviews, and Nebula reporting. We hope you have a wonderful summer (or winter, if yoursquo;re on the other side of the world) and keep listening! We will have other announcements next month!

Rated appropriate for teens and up - mild sexual situations, light battle description.

We kept in touch through the war, when he messaged me about marching through upstate New York.  He always started the same way:  "Dear Ryan, Please come kick my commanding officer in the balls."  Then he'd tell me about the latest mess--cracks in their radiation suits, or toxic waterholes that were supposed to be clear.  He never got in trouble for the messages; they needed him too badly.  My epilepsy disqualified me from the draft, which probably saved my life.  Pretty boys like me weren't exactly Army material.  By the time things were bad enough that they needed any warm body, there wasn't enough human government left to organize a draft.

The ruins at Binghamton were where Trey got sick.  By the time I got across the country to him, he'd recovered--well, as much as possible.  I remember the doctor's face as he says Trey will live, but he'll be in pain.</ns2:summary>

		<description>Science fiction inspires the world around us. It inspires our future. To discover these influences, we look to the future of science, to Science Future. The Science Future series presents the bleeding edge of scientific discovery and links it back to science fiction in order to discuss these influences and speculate on the future of science fiction.</description>

		<description>In the superbly-titled &lt;i&gt;The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms&lt;/i&gt;, Yeine Darr must fight a battle of political succession to determine the next ruler of the world. The problem is: I've read this book before, and I'm not sure this one brings anything new to the telling of the tale.</description>

For Want of a Nail
By Mary Robinette Kowal

With one hand, Rava adjusted the VR interface glasses where they bit into the bridge of her nose, while she kept her other hand buried in Cordeliarsquo;s innards. There was scant room to get the flexible shaft of a mono-lens and her hand through the access hatch in the AIrsquo;s chassis. From the next compartment, drums and laughter bled through the plastic walls of the ship, indicating her sisterrsquo;s conception party was still in full swing.

With only a single camera attached, the interface glasses didnrsquo;t give Rava depth perception as she struggled to replug the transmitter cable. The chassis had not been designed to need repair. At all. It had been designed to last hundreds of years without an upgrade.

If Rava couldnrsquo;t get the cable plugged in and working, Cordelia wouldnrsquo;t be able to download backups of herself to her long-term memory. She couldnrsquo;t store more than a week at a time in active memory. It would be the same as a slow death sentence.

The square head of the cable slipped out of Ravarsquo;s fingers. Again. ldquo;Dammit!rdquo; She slammed her heel against the shiprsquo;s floor in frustration.

ldquo;If you canrsquo;t do it, let someone else try.rdquo; Her older brother, Ludoviko, had insisted on following her out of the party as if he could help.

ldquo;You know, this would go a lot faster if you werenrsquo;t breathing down my neck.rdquo;

ldquo;You know, you wouldnrsquo;t be doing this at all if you hadnrsquo;t dropped her.rdquo;



Rava resisted the urge to pull the mono-lens out of the jack in her glasses and glare at him. He might have gotten better marks in school, but she was the AIrsquo;s wrangler. ldquo;Why donrsquo;t you go back to the party and see if you can learn something about fertility?rdquo; She lifted the cable head and tried one more time.

ldquo;Why, you littlemdash;rdquo; Rage choked his voice, more than she had expected from a random slam. She made a guess that his appeal to the repro-council didnrsquo;t go well.

Cordeliarsquo;s voice cut in, stopping what he was going to say. ldquo;Itrsquo;s not Ravarsquo;s fault. I did ask her to pick me up.rdquo;

ldquo;Yeah.rdquo; Rava focused on the cable, trying to get it aligned.

ldquo;Right.rdquo; Ludoviko snorted. ldquo;And then you dropped yourself.rdquo;

Cordelia sighed and Rava could almost imagine breath tickling her skin. ldquo;If yoursquo;re going to blame anyone, blame Branson Conchord for running into her.rdquo;

Rava didnrsquo;t bother answering. Theyrsquo;d been having the same conversation for the last hour and Cordelia should know darn well what Ludovikorsquo;s answer would be.

Like programming, he said, ldquo;It was irresponsible. She should have said no. The room was full of intoxicated, rowdy people and you are too valuable an asset.rdquo;

Rava rested her head against the smooth wood side of the AIrsquo;s chassis and closed her eyes, ignoring her brother and the flat picture in her goggles. Her fingers rolled the slick plastic head of the cable, building a picture in her mind of the white square and the flat gold cord stretching from it. She slid the cable forward until it jarred against the socket. Rotating the head, Rava focused all her attention on the tiny clues of friction vibrating up her arm. This was a simple, comprehensible problem.

She didnrsquo;t want to think about what would happen if she couldnrsquo;t repair the damage.

Being unable to download her old memories meant Cordelia would have to delete herself bit by bit to keep functioning. All because Rava had asked if she wanted to dance. At least Ludoviko hadnrsquo;t heard that part...</ns2:summary>

Amaryllis
By Carrie Vaughn

I never knew my mother, and I never understood why she did what she did. I ought to be grateful that she was crazy enough to cut out her implant so she could get pregnant. But it also meant she was crazy enough to hide the pregnancy until termination wasnrsquo;t an option, knowing the whole time that shersquo;d never get to keep the baby. That shersquo;d lose everything. That her household would lose everything because of her.

I never understood how she couldnrsquo;t care. I wondered what her family thought when they learned what shersquo;d done, when their committee split up the household, scattered themmdash;broke them, because of her.

Did she think I was worth it?
#

It was all about quotas.

ldquo;Theyrsquo;re using cages up north, I heard. Off shore, anchored,rdquo; Nina said. ldquo;Fifty feet acrossmdash;twice as much protein grown with half the resources, and wersquo;d never have to touch the wild population again. We could double our quota.rdquo;

I hadnrsquo;t really been listening to her. We were resting, just for a moment; she sat with me on the railing at the prow of Amaryllis and talked about her big plans.

Wind pulled the sails taut and the fiberglass hull cut through waves without a sound, we sailed so smooth. Garrett and Sun hauled up the nets behind us, dragging in the catch. Amaryllis was elegant, a 30-foot sleek vessel with just enough cabin and cargo spacemdash;an antique but more than seaworthy. She was a good boat, with a good crew. The best.

ldquo;Mariemdash;rdquo; Nina said, pleading.

I sighed and woke up. ldquo;Wersquo;ve been over this. We canrsquo;t just double our quota.rdquo;

ldquo;But if we got authorizationmdash;rdquo;

ldquo;Donrsquo;t you think wersquo;re doing all right as it is?rdquo; We had a good crewmdash;we were well fed and not exceeding our quotas; I thought wersquo;d be best off not screwing all that up. Not making waves, so to speak.

Ninarsquo;s big brown eyes filled with tearsmdash;Irsquo;d said the wrong thing, because I knew what she was really after, and the status quo wasnrsquo;t it.

ldquo;Thatrsquo;s just it,rdquo; she said. ldquo;Wersquo;ve met our quotas and kept everyone healthy for years now. I really think we should try. We can at least ask, canrsquo;t we?rdquo;

The truth was: No, I wasnrsquo;t sure we deserved it. I wasnrsquo;t sure that kind of responsibility would be worth it. I didnrsquo;t want the prestige. Nina didnrsquo;t even want the prestigemdash;she just wanted the baby.

ldquo;Itrsquo;s out of our hands at any rate,rdquo; I said, looking away because I couldnrsquo;t bear the intensity of her expression.

Pushing herself off the rail, Nina stomped down Amaryllisrsquo; port side to join the rest of the crew hauling in the catch. She wasnrsquo;t old enough to want a baby. She was lithe, fit, and golden, running barefoot on the deck, sun-bleached streaks gleaming in her brown hair. Actually, no, she was old enough. Shersquo;d been with the house for seven yearsmdash;she was twenty, now. It hadnrsquo;t seemed so long.

ldquo;Whoa!rdquo; Sun called. There was a splash and a thud as something in the net kicked against the hull. He leaned over the side, the muscles along his broad, coppery back flexing as he clung to a net that was about to slide back into the water. Nina, petite next to his strong frame, reached with him. I ran down and grabbed them by the waistbands of their trousers to hold them steady. The fourth of our crew, Garrett, latched a boat hook into the net. Together we hauled the catch onto the deck. Wersquo;d caught something big, heavy, and full of powerful muscles.

We had a ...</ns2:summary>

The Things
By Peter Watts

I am being Blair. I escape out the back as the world comes in through the front.

I am being Copper. I am rising from the dead.

I am being Childs. I am guarding the main entrance.

The names don't matter. They are placeholders, nothing more; all biomass is interchangeable. What matters is that these are all that is left of me. The world has burned everything else.

I see myself through the window, loping through the storm, wearing Blair. nbsp;MacReady has told me to burn Blair if he comes back alone, but MacReady still thinks I am one of him. I am not: I am being Blair, and I am at the door. I am being Childs, and I let myself in. I take brief communion, tendrils writhing forth from my faces, intertwining: I am BlairChilds, exchanging news of the world.

The world has found me out. It has discovered my burrow beneath the tool shed, the half-finished lifeboat cannibalized from the viscera of dead helicopters. The world is busy destroying my means of escape. Then it will come back for me.

There is only one option left. I disintegrate. Being Blair, I go to share the plan with Copper and to feed on the rotting biomass once called  Clarke ; so many changes in so short a time have dangerously depleted my reserves. Being Childs, I have already consumed what was left of Fuchs and am replenished for the next phase. nbsp;I sling the flamethrower onto my back and head outside, into the long Antarctic night.

I will go into the storm, and never come back.

#

I was so much more, before the crash. I was an explorer, an ambassador, a missionary. I spread across the cosmos, met countless worlds, took communion: the fit reshaped the unfit and the whole universe bootstrapped upwards in joyful, infinitesimal increments. I was a soldier, at war with entropy itself. I was the very hand by which Creation perfects itself.

So much wisdom I had. So much experience. Now I cannot remember all the things I knew. I can only remember that I once knew them.

I remember the crash, though. It killed most of this offshoot outright, but a little crawled from the wreckage: a few trillion cells, a soul too weak to keep them in check. Mutinous biomass sloughed off despite my most desperate attempts to hold myself together: panic-stricken little clots of meat, instinctively growing whatever limbs they could remember and fleeing across the burning ice. By the time I'd regained control of what was left the fires had died and the cold was closing back in. I barely managed to grow enough antifreeze to keep my cells from bursting before the ice took me.

I remember my reawakening, too: dull stirrings of sensation in real time, the first embers of cognition, the slow blooming warmth of awareness as body and soul embraced after their long sleep. I remember the biped offshoots surrounding me, the strange chittering sounds they made, the odd  uniformity  of their body plans. How ill-adapted they looked! How  inefficient  their morphology! Even disabled, I could see so many things to fix. So I reached out. I took communion. I tasted the flesh of the worldmdash;

mdash;and the world attacked me. It  attacked  me.

I left that place in ruins. It was on the other side of the mountainsmdash;the  Norwegian camp , it is called heremdash;and I could never have crossed that distance in a biped skin. Fortunately there was another shape to choose from, smaller than the biped but better adapted to the local climate. I hid within it while the rest of me fought off the attack. I fled into the night on four legs, and let the rising flames cover my escape.

I did not stop running until I...</ns2:summary>

		<description>While Laurell K. Hamilton's &lt;i&gt;Hit List&lt;/i&gt; is better than the three Anita Blake books that preceded it, it still suffers from the same problems that bothered me about the others -- specifically, even though the action is well-written, none of the characters will just shut up and let the action happen.</description>

Plus Or Minus

By James Patrick Kelly

Everything changed once Beep found out that Mariskarsquo;s mother was the famous Natalya Volochkova.nbsp;nbsp; Mariskarsquo;s life aboard the Shining Legend went immediately from bad to awful.nbsp; Even before he singled her out, she had decided that there was no way shersquo;d be spending the rest of her teen years crewing on an asteroid bucket.nbsp; Once Beep started persecuting her, she began counting down the remaining days of the run as if she were a prisoner.nbsp; She tried explaining that she had no use for Natalya Volochkova, who had never been much of a mother to her, but Beep wouldnrsquo;t hear it.nbsp; He didnrsquo;t care that Mariska had only signed on to the Shining Legend to get back at her mother for ruining her life.

Somehow that hadnrsquo;t worked out quite the way she had planned.

For example, there was crud duty.nbsp; With a twisting push Mariska sailed into the command module, caught herself on a handrail, and launched toward the starboard wall.nbsp; The racks ofnbsp; instrument screens chirped and beeped and buzzed; command was one of the loudest mods on the ship.nbsp; She stuck her landing in front of navigation rack and her slippers caught on the deck burrs, anchoring her in the shiprsquo;snbsp; .0006 gravity.nbsp;nbsp; Sure enough, she could see new smears of mold growing from the crack where the nav screen fit into the wall.nbsp; This was Beeprsquo;s fault, although he would never admit it.nbsp; He kept the humidity jacked up in Command, said that dry air gave him nosebleeds.nbsp; Richard FiveFord claimed they came from all the drugs Beep sniffed but Mariska didnrsquo;t want to believe that.nbsp; Also Beep liked to sip his coffee from a cup instead sucking it out of a bag, even though he slopped all the time.nbsp; Fungi loved the sugary spatters.nbsp; She sniffed one particularly vile looking smear of mold.nbsp; It smelled faintly like the worms she used to grow back home on the Moon.nbsp; She wiped her nose with the sleeve of her jersey and reached to the holster on her belt for her sponge. As she scrubbed, the bitter vinegar tang of disinfectant gel filled the mod.nbsp; Not for the first time, she told herself that this job stunk.

She felt the tingle of Richard FiveFord offering a mindfeed and opened her head.nbsp; =What?=

His feed made a pleasant fizz behind her eyes, distracting her. =You done any time soon?=nbsp; Distraction was Richardrsquo;s specialty

=No.=

=Didit is making a dream for us.=



She slapped her sponge at the wall in frustration.nbsp; =This sucks.=nbsp; Mariska couldnrsquo;t remember the last time Didit or Richard FiveFord had pulled crud duty.

=Should we wait for you?=

=If you want.=nbsp; But she knew they wouldnrsquo;t. =Might be another hour.=

ldquo;Yoursquo;re working, Volochkova.rdquo; Beeprsquo;s voice crackled over the loudspeaker.nbsp; One of his quirks was snooping their private feeds and then yelling at them over the shiprsquo;s com.

ldquo;Yes, sir,rdquo; she said.nbsp; Beep liked to be called sir.nbsp; It made him feel like the captain of the Shining Legend instead of senior monkey of its maintenance crew.

ldquo;Shersquo;s working, FiveFord.nbsp; Leave our sweet young thing alone.rdquo;

She felt Richardrsquo;s feed pop like a bubble.nbsp; He was more afraid of Beep than she was even though the old crank hardly ever bullied Richard.nbsp; Mariska hated being called sweet young thing.nbsp; She wasnrsquo;t sweet and she wasnrsquo;t all that young.nbsp; She was already fifteen in conscious years, eighteen if you counted the time she had hibernated.

When Mariska finished wiping th...</ns2:summary>

		<description>&lt;i&gt;Geist&lt;/i&gt;, by Philippa Ballantine, combines the best of what I like in 1990s fantasy fiction with the scope of a doorstop novel... and then pares out all the extraneous crap that makes a fantasy novel into a doorstop. It's an enjoyable book to read, even if it's got a few too many tropes that we've all read before.</description>

This month wersquo;re bringing you short story and novella nominees for the Hugo awards, one of the two big Science Fiction and Fantasy awards alongside the Nebula. The Nebulas are awarded by members of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, and the Hugos by the attendees of Worldcon. The Nebularsquo;s were awarded in May, and wersquo;ll find out who wins the Hugos next month at Renovation in Reno, Nevada.

Itrsquo;s always been more than a bit amusing to me to see the inevitable lsquo;That got nominated? The [insert award name] is losing itrsquo; comments cropping up on our forums and elsewhere. As if the Nebulas and Hugos are awarded by some wise men up on the crags, parsing the yearrsquo;s crop of stories against the awardrsquo;s prior canon. The nominations and awards come from a large swath of fandom or onersquo;s fellow writers, and therersquo;s always going to be elements of friendship, politics, fervent loyalty, and emotion in these endeavors.

And yet, the nominating crowds for both pick stories that are good, and worth reading. You wonrsquo;t like all of them, but yoursquo;ll like a lot of them, and that is really the best you can hope for. Fiction is not nearly so varied as fiction readers, and the point of these things is to make sure good stories get the biggest audience then can.

Which is also the point of Soundproof. People write into us about having friends that canrsquo;t stand hearing stories, or who have a deaf spouse, or they just prefer to read.

The point of Escape Pod is getting as many good stories out to as many ears and eyes (or fingers, if anyonersquo;s feeding this into one of those Braille boxes) as possible, which is why wersquo;ve worked hard to keep things free, taking advertising when we like the advertiser, and being ever thankful to those of you who donate. We couldnrsquo;t do it without you. (Which is why Dave Thompson and Wilson Fowlie have been working hard to bring those who donate the Alphabet Quartet as a thank you.)

Hopefully one of the Hugo nominees in this issue will get the shiny, shiny rocket ship next month. Theyrsquo;re all worthy of it, even if they are [insert ghastly sub-genre].

		<description>The things I really liked in &lt;i&gt;Scouts&lt;/i&gt; are back in &lt;i&gt;Pirates&lt;/i&gt; -- worldbuilding, characterization, and wry humor -- but I didn't feel the sense of discovery with &lt;i&gt;Pirates&lt;/i&gt; that I had with the previous book, and, for me, that's its downfall.</description>

Episode 300! Wow!

We Go Back
Tim Pratt

My best friend Jenny Kay climbed in through my window and nearly stepped on my head. If I'd been sleeping a foot closer to the wall, I would've gotten a face full of her boot, but instead I just snapped awake and said "What who what now?" and blinked a lot.

"Oh damn," Jenny said in a loudish whisper. "When did you move your bed under the window?"

"Last week," I said, sitting up in bed. "I wanted a change." If you can't rearrange your life, you can at least rearrange yourself, and if your mom won't let you dye your hair blue, you can make do with rearranging your rooms.

Jenny Kay dropped from standing to sitting in one motion, making my mattress bounce, and landed cross-legged and totally comfortable. "Hey," she said. "So I need to borrow your ring." I couldn't read her expression in the dim moonlight from the window.

I looked at my right hand, where a thin silver ring looped my index finger, catching what light there was in the room and giving back twinkles. The metal grew cold against my skin and tightened a fraction, almost a friendly little squeeze. The ring -- which wasn't really a ring -- could tell when I was thinking about it. "Uh," I said.

Jenny nodded vigorously, a motion I felt in the jostling of the mattress more than I saw. "I know! I know. But I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important. I mean, you've had the thing for more than a year, and I've never asked once if I could use it, right?"

I glanced at my closed door -- no glow under the crack at the bottom, which meant my parents had gone to their separate beds and turned out the hall light -- and switched on my bedside lamp. Jenny was dressed in jeans and a sweater, all in dark grays and blacks, not her usual aggressively flamboyant colorful mishmash style at all. Good for sneaking into people's windows, I guessed.

I sat up against the headboard, because when you're about to annoy your best friend, it's better not to be flat on your back at the time. "I wish I could," I said -- not one hundred percent true, but Jenny was a fourteen-year-old genius, not a human lie detector. "But it's, like... part of me. You know? I'm part of the mechanism. I can't just take it off. It's linked into my, what's it called, socratic nervous system?"

"Somatic," Jenny said gloomily. She was almost as good at biology as she was at math. "The part of your nervous system that controls movement, which sort of halfway makes sense, I guess."

I shrugged. "So, there you go. The ring's not something I wear. It's something that wears me.  Or we wear each other. What did you want it for?"



She looked away. "Nothing. An errand."

I sighed. "Tell me, Jay Kay. Maybe I can help. Is it about a boy?"

Jenny just bit her lip. Good enough. The past few months it's pretty much always been about a boy.

I took her hand. Me and Jenny go way back, and whenever I say that, older people laugh, because I'm fifteen and she's fourteen, and they're like, you're too young to even have a "way back." But I've known Jenny since she skipped first grade and ended up in my second-grade class, which means I've been her best friend for about half my life, and how many of you old people have a friendship with that kind of percentage? She used to hide me in her basement when things got too bad and I ran away from home, and she's the reason I've never failed a math or science class. I owe her. I'm not saying I'd kill for her or anything, but I mean, I like to think I'd help her bury the bodies.

"Okay," I said. "I'll help. Where are we going?"

"I don't want to get you into any trouble," she said. "It's my problem, I should really deal with it myself."

I shrugged. "Mom stopped doing the middle-of-the-night spot checks mo</ns2:summary>

Stone Wall Truth
by Caroline M. Yoachim

Njeri sewed the woman together with hairs from a zebra tail.  Her deer-bone needle dipped under the womanrsquo;s skin and bobbed back out.  The contrast of the white seams against her dark skin was striking.

ldquo;The center seam makes a straight line,rdquo; Njeri told her apprentice, ldquo;but the others flow with the natural curves of the body, just as the Enshai River follows the curve of the landscape.rdquo;

Odion leaned in to examine her work, his breath warm on the back of her neck.  Foolish boy, wasting his attention on her.  Njeri set her needle on the table and stood up to stretch.  The job was nearly done -- shersquo;d repositioned the womanrsquo;s organs, reconstructed her muscles, sewn her body back together.  Only the face was still open, facial muscles splayed out in all directions from the womanrsquo;s skull like an exotic flower in full bloom.

ldquo;Why sew them back together, after the wall?rdquo; Odion asked.  ldquo;Why not let them die?rdquo;



Njeri sighed.  The boy had steady hands and a sharp mind, but his heart was unforgiving.  He had been eager to learn about the cutting, about the delicate art of preparing a patient to hang from the wall.  What he questioned was the sewing, the part of the work that had drawn Njeri to this calling.  She studied the woman on the table -- the last surviving grandchild of Radmalende, who had been king when the country was ruled by kings instead of warlords.  The two of them had come of age the same spring, and had taken their adulthood rites together.  That had been many years ago, but it was hard for Njeri not to think of her childhood friend by name.  ldquo;You think I should leave her to die?rdquo;

ldquo;Her bones were black as obsidian.rdquo;  He traced the center seam with his finger.

Njeri said nothing.  She admired the woman for her strength; she hadnrsquo;t cried or protested or made excuses.  Few women were put on the wall, but this one had faced it as bravely as any man, braver than some.  And her shadowself had been like nothing Njeri had ever seen.  Dark, of course, but a tightly controlled blackness, an army of ants marching out from her heart and along her bones.  A constantly shifting shadow that never rested too long in any one place.

ldquo;She made a play for the throne.  Killed six Maiwatu guardsmen in the process.  Her attack has opened the way for the Upyatu.  I heard a rumor today the capitol is still under siege.rdquo;  Odion masked the worry in his voice, but Njeri knew he was concerned.  He had many friends in the upper echelons of the ruling class -- it was how he came to be apprenticed to the highest ranking surgeon at the longest stretch of wall.

ldquo;There is always unrest in the capitol.rdquo;  Njeri didnrsquo;t add that this woman had a stronger claim to the citrine throne than most.  ldquo;Besides, itrsquo;s not our place to say what people deserve.  General Bahtir pays us to take people apart and put them back together, not to judge them.rdquo;

Njeri nudged Odion aside.  She settled back into her stool, and he went outside to set some water boiling for tea.  He didnrsquo;t appreciate being pushed away, didnrsquo;t understand why she didnrsquo;t want him the way he wanted her.  She wanted to tell the boy to find someone his own age, someone who liked boys, but Odion wouldnrsquo;t listen.  Njeri returned to her work.  The womanrsquo;s jawbone hung slack below her skull, but her mouth still closed around the clear stone that held her mind while Njeri patched her body together.  The womanrsquo;s eyes stared up at the thatched straw roof, empty, with nothing but bone surround...</ns2:summary>

Leech Run
by Scott W. Baker

The inhabitants of Galileo Station parted as Titan moved among them.  Not one made eye contact, but all gawked furtively.  One of Titan's dark eyes glared back down at the throng; the other eye remained hidden behind a curtain of stark white hair.  Conspicuous appearance was his curse.  What bystander would forget a snow-capped mountain of dark muscle?  Memorability was not an asset for someone like him.

One body in the crowd moved toward Titan rather than away.  "The passengers is aboard, love," the man said.

"Reif, call me 'love' in public and you'll find yourself very uncomfortable."  Titan lowered his voice so it stayed within the wide berth granted by the populace.  "How many passengers?"

"Thirty-two, lo -- Captain."

Titan shook his head.  "Hemingway promised fifty."

"If Hem flew so bad as he scored cargo--"

"Any load of leeches will turn a profit," Titan assured the mechanic.  "But small load doesn't mean small risk.  I want you sharp."

"As ever, love."

They continued through the bustling station to their ship, a little cargo runner designed for intra-system transport at sub-light speeds.  Of course, a mechanic of Reif's skill could make a ship reach speeds its designers never fathomed.

Such deviant engineering demanded a pilot with a select set of skills and dubious moral character.  Hemingway possessed both.  He was waiting for them beside the ship with his ever-present, boastful grin.

"I said there be takers on Galileo, didn't I?" Hemingway said as his crewmates entered earshot.  "I done already told them the rules."

Titan's brow furrowed.  "Thirty-two?  Don't dislocate anything patting yourself on the back.  And there's just one rule on my ship."

Titan brushed past his pilot into the cargo hold.  It was a small hold, even for an intra-system runner, but it hadn't always been so.  Reif's touch here made for ideal leech transport.  The customized hold maintained a six-foot buffer from all electrical systems, enough of a gap that even a class-three leech couldn't siphon a single ampere.  Despite his extensive precautions, Titan always felt uneasy with such capricious cargo.


Titan surveyed the passengers perched shoulder to shoulder on the plank benches that were bolted to the hold's bare metal floor.  Leeches, every last one of them.  They didn't look dangerous.  On a ship in deep space, they could be as lethal as any weapon.

Aside from passengers and benches, the hold was barren: no amenities, no restraints, no personal possessions, no plumbing.  These thirty-two leeches would spend the next two weeks in this metal tank.  No normal human would accept such accommodations.  Why should they when a starliner would take them all the way to Kilroth for a couple hundred cred?  This kind of travel was for people the liners would never touch.  Alpha System law guaranteed anyone foolish enough to transport a leech would spend the rest of his life laboring on a prison planet -- one too close to a sun for a proper settlement but too mineral-rich to resist exploiting.  Such labor colonies' conditions were enough to make one envy the leeches' sentences; they were simply shot on sight.

Of course Alpha was a big system, difficult to monitor.  A captain could make a few thousand cred smuggling a leech between planets.  Carrying them all the way to a friendlier system, as Titan did, could net a small fortune.  Titan demanded twenty grand a head.  Alpha's policies on leech-genocide made the price a bargain.

"There is only one rule on my ship," Titan announced again, this time to his hold full of human contraband, "no one leaves the hold."  He walked along the </ns2:summary>

Hey folksmdash;

Short editorrsquo;s note this month to make sure this goes out reasonably on time to all you faithful listeners. Er, readers.

Last month saw a bit of mopping-up action on the various nominees with Stone Wall Truth, which got nominated in the novella category for the Nebula, and the space-piratical Leech Run.

But most importantly, we hit Episode 300 of the podcast that Steve built with Tim Prattrsquo;s We Go Back. Who Escape Pod goes pretty far back with. His stories are episodes 8, 31 (with Greg van Eekhout), 67, 105, 142, 190, 239, 251 and 276. Hersquo;s probably far and away the Escape Pod fan favorite, and Impossible Dreams is still the story I usually recommend as the entry point for new Escape Pod listeners.

Itrsquo;s been a little over a year since Mur took over and I snuck in through an open side Escape Pod airlock (for closed values of open). Wersquo;re still adrift in space, same as it ever was, floating along scanning for the next story, and eventually a planet to set down on. Like many fiction journeys, the path laid out at the beginning is not the path you end up going down, because that would be boring.

Until the next,






mdash;Bill

Union Dues: Sidekicks in Stockholm
by Jeffrey R. DeRego

Five of them at least, with submachine guns, body armor, and more dynamite than I've seen outside a Tom and Jerry cartoon. They all sound the same thanks to some digital vocal thing built into their black suits. They all look the same with black ski masks underneath a mesh sort of fencing helmet, black everything else right to the boots, and all about the same size, like someone took a picture of a terrorist and photocopied it.

This whole drama seems like it began a million years ago by now. I was scheduled to come here and open a convention of business leaders and up-and-coming corporate types. My speech, Good Corporate Citizenship, with examples of how The Union gives back to the communities it serves, is a two year old piece worked up and updated by Marketing and Promotions to accommodate a new administration in Washington, and some new economic stuff that I don't really understand. I'd delivered only half of the text before these guys burst through the door.


I froze at the first gunshot, not for long, just a few seconds, just long enough to be useless.

The girl who sits beside me ndash; her name tag reads "Hello my name is Stacy" ndash; leans in close. She whispers, "What are you going to do, Adam?"
I try and ignore her and watch the men. My wrist feels weirdly cool and light without the communicator gauntlet and beacon strapped around it. I glance down at my gloves and the tatters of honeycombed teflon-spandex straps where the gauntlet was stitched on. You're Adam Smasher! Goddamn it. Do something! I've only been in the orange suit and cape for three years. I had the physique and the right chin at the right time and until about and hour ago thought the role fit pretty well.

My predecessor died of a heart attack in the New York Pyramid training room two days after his thirtieth birthday, the original Adam Smasher sits connected to a mechanical heart pump in The Village somewhere in Antarctica. He's the Adam Smasher everyone remembers from Saturday-morning TV, blonde and chiseled, his orange one piece suit and mask almost glowing, his tritium atom insignia a mark of galactic strength as he caught speeding, robber-filled cars, fought off robots and gangsters and the evil machinations of Dr. Destruction. Don't get me wrong, when people talk to me, they talk to Adam Smasher, but sometimes I want to scream out, "I used to watch 'The Adventures of Adam Smasher' on TV too, in syndication!"

I should be thankful anyone remembers the show at all.

Atom Comics' teen and adult readers have moved on to darker, grittier titles by competing publishers and, well, look at me? I'm like a smiling Day-Glo orange tree. The kid demographic wants the crazy soap opera stuff like Team Shikaragaki not a creaky old walking ethics lesson. So, The Union pulls Adam Smasher comics. My figure goes into the much less produced "classics" line. No playsets. No video game adaptations. No TV. Meanwhile, I wait for Marketing and Promotions to generate interest in Adam Smasher. Maybe I come back darker, or kiddier, or something completely different. Until then, my whole life is giving lectures about doing the right thing and leveraging the audience's nostalgia for a true-blue ndash; well, orange ndash; Union Superhero.

"Adam, how are you going to get us out of this?" Stacy is maybe twenty five. Blue eyed, petite ndash; but then, everyone looks sort of petite to me as I'm just scraping seven-foot-three tall and thirty nine inches across the shoulders ndash; every time she looks at the terrorists her eyes widen with fear, and every time she looks at me they widen more, with hope.

I try not to look at he...</ns2:summary>

		<description>&lt;i&gt;Spectyr&lt;/i&gt; contains action, adventure, exotic locales, airships, and a good Boss Fight, all well-written and without the info-dumps many fantasy authors fall prey to. I just wish the book hadn't followed almost the exact same story arcs (albeit with different settings and characters) as its predecessor.</description>

Midnight Blue

Hersquo;d never seen a burgundy before.nbsp; Kim held it in her lap, tapped it with her finger.nbsp; She  was probably tapping it to bring attention to it, and Jeff didnrsquo;t want  to give her the satisfaction of asking to see it, but he really wanted  to see it.nbsp; Burgundy (Kim had insisted on calling it burgundy red when she showed it at show and tell) was a rare one.nbsp; Not as rare as a hot pink Flyer or a viridian Better Looking, but still rare.

A bus roared up, spitting black smoke.nbsp; It was the seven bus--the Linden Court bus, not his.nbsp; Kids rushed to line up in front of the big yellow doors as the bus hissed to a stop.nbsp; A second-grader squealed, shoved a bigger kid with her Partridge Family lunch box because hersquo;d stepped on her foot.nbsp; All the younger kids seemed to have Partridge Family lunch boxes this year.

ldquo;What did you say it did when yoursquo;ve got all three pieces of the charm together?rdquo; nbsp;Jeff asked Kim.nbsp; He said it casually, like he was just making conversation until his bus came.

ldquo;It relaxes time,rdquo; Kim said.nbsp; ldquo;When yoursquo;re bored you can make time pass quickly, and when yoursquo;re having fun you can make time stretch out.rdquo;

Jeff nodded, tried to look just interested enough to be polite, but no more.nbsp; What must that be like, to make the hour at church fly by?nbsp; Or make the school day (except for lunch and recess) pass in an eyeblink? nbsp;Jeff wondered how fast or slow you could move things along.nbsp; Could you make it seem like you were eating an ice cream sandwich for six hours?nbsp; That would be sparkling fine.

ldquo;Want to see it?rdquo; Kim asked.

ldquo;Okay,rdquo; Jeff said, holding out his hands too eagerly before he remembered himself.nbsp; Kim handed it to him, looking pleased with herself, the dimples on her round face getting a little deeper.

It was smooth as marble, perfectly round, big as a grapefruit and heavy as a bowling ball.nbsp; It made Jeffrsquo;s heart hammer to hold it.nbsp; The  rich red, which hinted at purple while still being certainly red, was  so beautiful it seemed impossible, so vivid it made his blue shirt seem  like a Polaroid photo left in the sun too long.

ldquo;Imagine finding this in the wild?nbsp; Pushing over a dead tree and seeing it sitting there under the root?rdquo; Jeff said.



ldquo;Yeah, right,rdquo; Kim said.nbsp; ldquo;Not likely.rdquo;nbsp; She shook her long brown hair back over her shoulder.nbsp; She did that all day long in class.nbsp; She thought she was so gorgeous.

A few of the other kids circled around to take a look.nbsp; Jeff  spun it around until he found the hole where it would be fitted to one  side of the staff, when someone got the whole charm together.

ldquo;Will  your father try to get the other two pieces, do you think?rdquo; Ricky Adamo  asked, reaching to pet it once, probably just so he could say hersquo;d  touched one.

ldquo;Hersquo;s  only keeping this as an investment,rdquo; Kim said, holding out her hands to  take it back from Jeff, who passed it over, his fingers suddenly  feeling much too light.nbsp; ldquo;My fatherrsquo;s going to buy me a whole chartreuse to absorb when Irsquo;m 18.nbsp; Irsquo;m going to be a doctor.rdquo;

ldquo;He is not,rdquo; Jeff said.nbsp; ldquo;Most of the chartreuse ones thatrsquo;ve been found have already been absorbed.nbsp; The ones that havenrsquo;t, your father would have to give your whole house and everything in it just to get one sphere.rdquo;

ldquo;What would you know about it?rdquo; Kim said, glaring.nbsp; ldquo;You donrsquo;t even know what it feels like to absorb one!nbsp; Yoursquo;ve probably never even owned a sphere, let alone absorbed a whole charm...</ns2:summary>

		<description>Overall, I think that the Sorcerer's Stone soundtrack will forever live on in our hearts because it gave us "Hedwig's Theme". However, as soundtracks go, I'd consider it average for John Williams, who has given us plenty of truly-amazing music cues in the past.</description>

Radio nbsp;Nowhere
by Douglas Smith

On the anniversary of the worst night of his life, Liam stood outside the darkened control room of the campus radio station. Over the speakers, the Tragically Hiprsquo;s ldquo;Boots and Heartsrdquo; was just winding down. Behind the glass in the studio, Ziggyrsquo;s small triangular face glowed like some night angel, lit from below by her laptop screen. She looked up, her eyes finding Liamrsquo;s in the darkness. Smiling, she wrinkled her nose at him. His own smile slid away, falling into the dark place inside him, the place that was always darker on this night.

Ziggy turned back to the mike as the song ended. ldquo;Irsquo;m closing with a request from an old friend, to an old friend. This onersquo;s for Jackie, from Liam. A hurtinrsquo; song, cuz hersquo;s still hurtinrsquo;. Fifteen years ago tonighthellip;rdquo; She looked at him through the glass.

Fifteen years. He closed his eyes. Fifteen years, and it still hurt this much.</ns2:summary>

		<description>While Chamber of Secrets is a darker film than the first Harry Potter, the soundtrack was still too juvenile to really pass on the feeling of peril in the danger sequences -- especially since the film had so many mood-lightening moments.</description>

Soulmates
by Mike Resnick and Lezli Robyn

Have  you ever killed someone you love ndash; I mean, really love?

I  did.

I  did it as surely as if Irsquo;d fired a bullet into her brain, and the  fact that it was perfectly legal, that everyone at the hospital told  me Irsquo;d done a humane thing by giving them permission to pull the plug,  didnrsquo;t make me feel any better. Irsquo;d lived with Kathy for twenty-six  years, been married to her for all but the first ten months. Wersquo;d  been through a lot together: two miscarriages, a bankruptcy, a trial  separation twelve years ago ndash; and then the car crash. They said shersquo;d  be a vegetable, that shersquo;d never think or walk or even move again.  I let her hang on for almost two months, until the insurance started  running out, and then I killed her.



Other  people have made that decision and they learn to live with it. I thought  I could, too. Irsquo;d never been much of a drinker, but I started about  four months after she died. Not much at first, then more every day until  Irsquo;d reach the point, later and later each time, where I couldnrsquo;t  see her face staring up at me anymore.

I  figured it was just a matter of time before I got fired ndash; and you  have to be pretty messed up to be fired as a night watchman at Global  Enterprises. Hell, I didnrsquo;t even know what they made, or at least  not everything they made. There were five large connected buildings,  and a watchman for each. Wersquo;d show up at ten orsquo;clock at night, and  leave when the first shift showed up at seven in the morning ndash; one  man and maybe sixty robots per building.

Yeah,  being sacked was imminent. Problem was, once yoursquo;ve been fired from  a job like this, therersquo;s nothing left but slow starvation. If you  canrsquo;t watch sixty pre-programmed robots and make sure the building  didnrsquo;t blow up, what the hell can you do?

I  still remember the night I met Mose.

I  let the Spy Eye scan my retina and bone structure, and after it let  me in I went directly to the bottle Irsquo;d hidden in the back of the  washroom. By midnight Irsquo;d almost forgotten what Kathy looked like  on that last day ndash; I suppose she looked pretty, like she always did,  but innocent was the word that came to mind ndash; and I was making  my rounds. I knew that Bill Nettles ndash; he was head man on the night  shift ndash; had his suspicions about my drinking and would be checking  up on me, so I made up my mind to ease off the booze a little. But I  had to get rid of Kathyrsquo;s face, so I took one more drink, and then  next thing I knew I was trying to get up off the floor, but my legs  werenrsquo;t working.

I  reached out for something to steady myself, to lean against as I tried  to stand, and what I found was a metal pillar, and a foot away was another  one. Finally my eyes started focusing, and I saw that what I had latched  onto were the titanium legs of a robot that had walked over when it  heard me cursing or singing or whatever the hell I was doing.

ldquo;Get  me on my feet!rdquo; I grated, and two strong metal hands lifted me to  my feet.

ldquo;All  you all right, sir?rdquo; asked the robot in a voice that wasnrsquo;t quite  a mechanical monotone. ldquo;Shall I summon help?rdquo;

rdquo;No!rdquo; I half-snapped, half-shouted. ldquo;No help!rdquo;

ldquo;But  you seem to be in physical distress.rdquo;

ldquo;Irsquo;ll  be fine,rdquo; I said. ldquo;Just help me to my desk, and stay with me for  a few minutes until I sober up.rdquo;

ldquo;I  do not understand the term, sir,rdquo; it said.

ldquo;Donrsquo;t  worry about...</ns2:summary>

Kill Me
by Vylar Kaftan

I'm sitting cross-legged on a rock in west Texas, somewhere north of El Paso, bleeding into the dirt.  The pose feels like a meditation.  I'm fascinated with the knife mark on my left thigh, a shallow slash from hip to knee.  It's surrounded by bruise clusters that look like flowers of broken skin.  In the silent desert, I hear only the soft clicking of the car cooling down.  Then his urine splashes against the rock behind me, and I hear his zipper when he's done.  The night breeze is icy on my back, drying the blood into clots.  He did me well, I admit, glancing up at the full desert moon.  If my body survived--which it wouldn't--I would be scarred, possibly disfigured.  The welts on my back throb like electricity, and everything--the moon, the desert, the wind--is alive with me.

He walks in front of me.  I look up at the man who brought me all the way from Denver.  He looks like a black dog, matted and angry, and growls like one too.  My eyes travel to the cluster of thick hair springing from his shirt neck.  He folds his arms over his chest.

"The night's almost over," I remind him.

He scowls.  "Get in the trunk."

I hesitate--he paid me to do the shy-girl act, a popular one--and he grabs my arm.  He hauls me over the rear bumper into the trunk of his '33 Axis.  He slaps me once across the face--not as hard as I expected--and crumples me into the tight compartment.  He slams the trunk closed, catching my hair in the door.  I try to pull free, but it's no use.  I don't think he meant that part, but he doesn't seem to notice the long trail of hair hanging out of the trunk.  The car door opens and the ignition starts.  I tug on my hair once more and then relax, concentrating on where I hurt, where my body throbs with pain.

As many times as I've done this, I still try to experience it all.  Because it's not every day you experience death.  Only every three months.</ns2:summary>

		<description>If you like science, CSI, stories that take place in Antarctica, or lots-of-people-crammed-into-a-small-space-slowly-going-mad, then you'll enjoy &lt;i&gt;Fade to Black&lt;/i&gt;. But the main character we were supposed to like was the one I disliked the most, and there was just too much for me to overlook in terms of tropes and internal monologuing.</description>

Greetings dear listeners!

I just returned from WorldCon where I met several listeners, thanks to everyone who came by to say hi! I was able to solicit stories from some pros and talk to some authors about their upcoming work - we've got an original piece from James Patrick Kelly coming up that I'm utterly thrilled about. But more on that another month...

The Hugo awards were given out on Saturday, August 20, and the ceremony was a blast. Jay Lake and Ken Scholes  brought their clever rapport to the stage and gave a good show with minimal hiccups (to my eyes, anyway. On Jay's blog he talks about how frantic it was when script pages went missing, etc.) Extra special congrats to Mary Robinette Kowal, who took the prize for Best Short Story (remember you can find "For Want of a Nail" at http://escapepod.org/2011/06/09/ep296-for-want-of-a-nail/ ) and Clarkesworld, the Best Semi-Pro winner that allowed us to use Kate Baker's fantastic narrations in our Hugo month! You can see the other winners at Escape Pod's home page.

Awards always serve to split people. While people covet awards, they still manage to convince themselves that the system is rigged, or undeserving works win, or people band behind their friends to skew the voting. I've read flat-out boring Hugo winners. I've wondered why fantastic stories didn't make even a nomination. I've seen fandom get frothing at the mouth angry over things like websites and podcasts edging into their territory (SF fans afraid of technology and the future. Mind boggling....)

This year the business part of WorldCon featured people that were so mad at last year's Starship Sofa win (and nomination this year, not to mention the excellent Writing Excuses got a nod for Best Related Work) that they decided to create a new category called Best FanCast. While this does show that they are accepting that the podcast is a medium that will not go away, it's somewhat sad that some people are now asking "are there enough podcasts to qualify?"

Head, meet desk.

What really worries me is that all podcasts will be pushed into Best Fancast just because of the medium. Escape Pod publishes stories and is a paying market (qualifying for Best Semi-pro Zine). Starship Sofa publishes stories and nonfic commentary/essays and qualifies (or qualified) for Best Fanzine. James Patrick Kelly's podcast novella Burn is a Nebula winner. Writing Excuses talks about writing and the SF craft, and it's done entirely by pro writers. Would all of these be pushed into the same category because of the podcast element? Why not put Blackout/All Clear, Asimov's, and Chicks Dig Time Lords in the same category because they're all on paper?

I'm not a strong arguer, I admit. It's not in my nature. But I believe I'm going to have to hit the business meetings next year in order to speak up for podcasts, else we'll all be shoved to the kids' table, the one with the rickety leg, just because of our medium instead of our content.

See you in Chicago next year, and at DragonCon this weekend!

		<description>In &lt;i&gt;The Magician King&lt;/i&gt;, Lev Grossman's return to the magical world of Fillory continues lampooning and lampshading the fantasy tropes we've all put in our fiction, and if the plot is a little weak, the storytelling makes up for that.</description>

		<description>For the first time in the Harry Potter series, we had a start-to-finish soundtrack that was a truly complete work of art. Patrick Doyle's Goblet of Fire soundtrack is, without a doubt, my favorite of the eight.</description>

The Insurance Agent
By Lavie Tidhar

The bar was packed and everyone was watching the Nixon-Reagan match. The fighters were reflected off the barrsquo;s grainy wood countertop and the tablesrsquo; gleaming surfaces and seemed to melt as they flickered down the legs of the scattered chairs. The bar was called the Godhead, which had a lot to do with why I was there. It was a bit of an unfair fight as Reagan was young, pre-presidency, circa-World War Two, while Nixon was heavy-set, older: people were exchanging odds and betting with the barrsquo;s internal gaming system and the general opinion seemed to be that though Reagan was in better shape Nixon was meaner.

I wasnrsquo;t there for the match.

The Godhead was on Pulau Sepanggar, one of the satellite islands off Borneo, hence nominally under Malaysian federal authority but in practice in a free zone that had stronger ties to the Brunei Sultanate. It was a convenient place to meet, providing easy access to the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and, of course, Singapore, which resented the islandrsquo;s role as a growing business centre yet found it useful at the same time.

She wore a smart business suit and a smart communication system that looked like what it was, which was a custom-made gold bracelet on her left arm. She wore smart shades and I was taking a bet that she wasnrsquo;t watching the fight. She was drinking a generic Cola but there was nothing generic about her. I slid into a chair beside her and waited for her shades to turn transparent and notice me.

lsquo;Drink, Mr. Turner?rsquo;



I liked the name Turner. It was Anglo-Saxon generic, a mid-level executiversquo;s name, white as beige. lsquo;Call me James,rsquo; I said. I liked James too. You could tell what a James Turner did just by hearing his name. The rest of me was tailor-made for the name, had been for some time: I had the kind of tan that suggested I had been East for just long enough to have acquired it, black hair that was short but not too short and had a decent but not overly-expensive cut, pale blue eyes behind shades that cost a lot of money to look like a knock-off.

There was a suggestion of a smile in the corners of her mouth and she said, lsquo;I donrsquo;t think I will.rsquo;

lsquo;Mr. Turner, then,rsquo; I said. lsquo;One namersquo;s good as another.rsquo;

lsquo;Quite,rsquo; she said. There was something dismissive in that single word. For the likes of you, was what it implied. lsquo;Thanks,rsquo; I said. lsquo;I think Irsquo;ll have that drink.rsquo;

lsquo;Preference?rsquo; she said.

I said lsquo;Orange juice,rsquo; wanted vodka. She didnrsquo;t say anything, didnrsquo;t have to. A moment later a waiter glided over and deposited the drink on the table, moisture condensing on the outer surface of the manifold that was the glass. I took a sip, put it down again into the ring of water that had immediately formed. Below, Nixon knocked out Reagan in the second round. I heard groans and shouts around me, tried to tune them out.

lsquo;What can I do for you?rsquo; I said.

I couldnrsquo;t quite tell where she was from. She had pale skin carefully kept out of the sun, an Oxford-acquired accent and eyes I couldnrsquo;t see. She said, lsquo;I would like to buy insurance.rsquo;

lsquo;That,rsquo; I said, possibly a little stiffly, lsquo;is why wersquo;re here.rsquo;

lsquo;Quite,rsquo; she said again, and I felt I won the round ndash; she did not like to waste her words and by answering me she had already thrown out six.

lsquo;Is this personal insurance or ndash;?rsquo; I said and she said, a little too quickly, lsquo;Personal.rsquo;

lsquo;Whorsquo;s the IE?rsquo; I said.

She frowned for a moment and I could a...</ns2:summary>

		<description>Nicholas Hooper, though a talented composer, seems to have swung and missed with his Order of the Phoenix soundtrack. It wasn't a character in the film, and it wasn't a complete work of art, although it did have some pretty cool cues.</description>

The Faithful Soldier, Prompted
by Saladin Ahmed

If I die on this piece-of-shit road, Lubnarsquo;s chances die with me. Ali leveled his shotgun at the growling tiger. In the name of God, who needs no credit rating, let me live! Even  when hersquo;d been a soldier, Ali hadnrsquo;t been very religious. But facing  death brought the old invocations to mind. The sway of culture, educated  Lubna would have called it. If she were here. If she could speak.

The creature stood still on the split cement, watching Ali.  Nanohanced tigers had been more or less wiped out in the great hunts  before the Global Credit Crusade, or so Ali had heard. I guess this is the shit end of ldquo;more or less.rdquo; More proof, as if he needed it, that traveling the Old Cairo Road on foot was as good as asking to die.

He almost thought he could hear the creaturersquo;s targeting system whir,  but of course he couldnrsquo;t any more than the tiger could read the  vestigial OS prompt that flashed across Alirsquo;s supposedly deactivated  retscreens.

God willing, Faithful Soldier, you will report for uniform inspection at 0500 hours.

Ali ignored the out-of-date message, kept his gun trained on the creature.

The tiger crouched to spring.

Ali squeezed the trigger, shouted ldquo;God is greater than credit!rdquo;



The cry of a younger man, from the days when hersquo;d let stupid causes use him. The days before hersquo;d met Lubna.

A sputtering spurt of shot sprayed the creature. The tiger roared, bled, and fled.

For a moment Ali just stood there panting. ldquo;Praise be to God,rdquo; he finally said to no one in particular. Irsquo;m coming, beloved. Irsquo;m going to get you your serum, and then Irsquo;m coming home.

A day later, Ali still walked the Old Cairo Road alone, the wind  whipping stinging sand at him, making a mockery of his old army-issued  sandmask. As he walked he thought of homendash;of Free Beirut and his humble  house behind the jade-and-grey-marble fountain. At home a medbed hummed  quietly, keeping Lubna alive even though she lay dying from the Green  Devil, which one side or the otherrsquo;s hover-dustings had infected her  with during the GCC. At home Lubna breathed shallowly while Alirsquo;s  ex-squadmate Fatman Fahrad, the only man in the world he still trusted,  stood watch over her.

Yet Ali had left on this madmanrsquo;s errandndash;left the woman who mattered  more to him than anything on Earthrsquo;s scorched surface. Serum was her  only hope. But serum was devastatingly expensive, and Ali was broke.  Every bit of money he had made working the hover-docks or doing security  for shops had gone to prepay days on Lubnarsquo;s medbed. And there was less  and less work to be had. Hersquo;d begun having dreams that made him wake up  crying. Dreams of shutting down Lubnarsquo;s medbed. Of killing himself.

And then the first strange message had appeared behind his eyes.

Like God-alone-knew how many vets, Alirsquo;s ostensibly inactive OS still garbled forth a glitchy old prompt from time to time

God willing, Faithful Soldier, you will pick up your new field ablution kit after your debriefing today.

God willing, Faithful Soldier, you will spend your leave-time dinars wiselyndash;at Honest Majoudirsquo;s!

But this new message had been unlike anything Ali had ever seen. Blood-freezingly current in its subject matter.

God willing, Faithful Soldier, you will go to the charity-yard of the Western Mosque in Old Cairo. She will live.

Alirsquo;s attention snapped back to the present as the wind picked up and  the air grew thick with san...</ns2:summary>

		<description>I was very pleased with Alexandre Desplat's soundtrack for the first part of Deathly Hallows. Not surprising, given that he did a lot of the same things Patrick Doyle did in Goblet of Fire -- my favorite of the eight.</description>

Night Bird Soaring
By T. L. Morganfield

On his sixth birthday, Totyoalli's parents took him to the holy city to  see the Emperor Cuauhtemoc, but the plane ride proved the most exciting  part. He kept his nose to the window, taking in the vast lands of the  One World, from the snow-capped mountains of his home in the northern  provinces to the open plains of Teotihuacan. He marveled at the  miniature cities and cars passing below. All his life he'd dreamt of  flying, ever since the first time he'd seen a bird gliding through the air.

From the airport, they took a cab to the royal palace on Lake Texcoco.  Tenochtitlan, the single largest city in the world, sprawled around it  for miles. The cab buzzed across one of the royal causeways, the water  blue and shimmering in the hot sun. Inside the walled royal complex  stood the Great Temple, meticulously maintained by a crew of thousands,  its sacred Sun Stone keeping watch over the visiting crowds.

At the palace, two genetically-engineered royal jaguar knights escorted  Totyoalli's family to the Emperor's gardens. Totyoalli watched their tails swish behind them, fascinated. Their heads looked so soft he  wished to pat them between the ears, but when he tried to talk to them,  they bared their fangs and gripped their spears a little tighter.



Ahead, a doorway opened onto a stone patio overlooking an expanse of  grass and trees. Marigolds and birds of paradise choked the flower beds.  Cranes stepped gingerly through the ponds while monkeys chattered in  the trees.

The Revered Speaker stood at the crest of the nearest hill, his hands  behind him and his back to them. "Good of you to come, Totyoalli." He  didn't turn. "Let me take a look at you."

Unafraid, Totyoalli hurried to him. His friends claimed the Revered  Speaker was seven hundred years old, that he'd been emperor when the  Spanish Devil Corteacute;s tried to bring the One World to its knees. Some  said Cuauhtemoc was the War God himself, or maybe the Fifth Sun incarnate, come to Earth to lead the Mexica through a thousand years of  glory. Totyoalli had expected someone very old and wise.

But in fact the Revered Speaker looked hardly out of his teens. He wore  green robes with the sacred day symbols embroidered in gold and silver  thread, and his long black hair was tied back in a complicated knot.  Blue, red, white, and black tattooed lines formed the profile of an  eagle on the right side of his face.

Cuauhtemoc knelt and kissed the earth at Totyoalli's feet, quoting  dedications and blessing him. He then took the boy's head in both hands  and granted him the kiss of Divine Grace on his forehead.

"Now that we have the formalities out of the way, walk with me."  Cuauhtemoc took Totyoalli by the hand and they moved down the hill, past  the egrets, until his mother and father vanished from sight. They sat  on a stone bench under a grove of willow trees. "So, how is calmecac?"

Totyoalli shrugged.

The Revered Speaker's smile widened. "Haven't much interest in studying?"

"I like the learning part, but the other boys say I should go to the  telpochcalli with the rest of the poor kids, and they pick fights."

"You haven't told them you're the Night Wind?"

"Mother told me not to."

Cuauhtemoc nodded. "She's not pleased with your destiny."

Totyoalli shook his head. His mother wished he weren't the Night  Wind; in fact, she'd gone to great lengths to plan a home delivery, so  the priests and government augurs couldn't record the exact time of his  birth. His father had thought her ridiculous, but respected her wishes,  and studied the instructional books to prepare for delivering their baby  himself. No doctor would attend; Totyoalli's mother susp...</ns2:summary>

This is the October issue, so I guess I should be sounding all spooky in the editorrsquo;s note, but That Holiday Which Must Be Feared is a month away, so instead why donrsquo;t we talk about reinvention.

Irsquo;m not that great at waiting out long serialized stories, and honestly with longer book series where the author is know for long stretches between novels (Cough-George-RR-Martin-Cough) I usually stop one before the last one out so I can at least control when Irsquo;ll restart the story. So comics have never been an ideal form for me, except for when the storylinersquo;s collected into a volume. Or, in the case of The Sandman, 10 volumes.

But wersquo;re a bit into DCrsquo;s reboot, and their reinvention means a bit more critical eye is being cast over their crop than would be if they hadnrsquo;t resorted to remaking themselves in the great American tradition. And while there are highs in the new crop, the lows have been getting most of the attention, because, well, while any reboot is going to lose you fans, it shouldnrsquo;t do this to young female fans: http://io9.com/5844355/

On a happier note, this is one-year anniversary of Escape Pod reinventing a bit of itself into a text product in addition to the audio coming into your ear canals every week. I think itrsquo;s been a success, but this is as good a point as any to stop and ask for feedback, so hit up feedback@escapepod.org with your suggestions for what we can do different/better in Soundproof.

This Soundproof is bringing you Lavie Tidharrsquo;s The Insurance Agent, Saladin Ahmedrsquo;s The Faithful Soldier, Prompted, and T. L. Morganfieldrsquo;s Night Bird Soaring. So itrsquo;s a strong issue.

Hope you enjoy it,

mdash;Bill

Playing Doctor
By Robert T. Jeschonek

The problem with having a crush on your mad scientist boss is, every day she doesn't see how wonderful you really are seems like the end of the world.

"This is all wrong!" says Dr. Hildegarde Medici, hurling the tray across her cavernous secret laboratory. nbsp;"You're a complete imbecile, Glue!"

Her words sting, but at least she's paying attention to me. nbsp;I'll take what I can get from the woman I love. nbsp;"I'm sorry, Dr. M. nbsp;Please let me try again."

"Everything is ruined." nbsp;With one arm, Dr. Medici sweeps notebooks and glass beakers from the table in front of her. nbsp;"Now I'll never finish the doomsday weapon today!"

As Dr. Medici throws her head down onto her folded arms on the table, I cross the lab and pick up the silver tray that she threw. nbsp;I see myself reflected in its surface--thick glasses, big nose, bald head, pure geek...not her type. nbsp;"I thought you liked the crinkle-cut ones," I say as I pluck chicken fingers and french fries from the floor and drop them onto the tray.

"Steak fries," says Dr. Medici without raising her head. nbsp;"How many times do I have to tell you, Glue?"


She is such a drama queen, but what do you expect? nbsp;Her line of work attracts a certain type of personality--passionate, temperamental, creative, flamboyant. nbsp;To tell you the truth, it's one of the things I love most about her.

"I could run to the store," I say, dumping the chicken and fries into a waste basket. nbsp;"By the time you're done building your doomsday weapon, I could have hot fries ready for you."

Dr. Medici rolls her eyes like a disgusted teenager. nbsp;"I can't concentrate on building a doomsday weapon on an empty stomach."

I know the feeling...the not being able to concentrate part, that is. nbsp;Most days, I can barely focus on my work instead of Dr. Medici's long black hair and bright green eyes. nbsp;Once, I was so distracted by Dr. M that I cross-wired the brain of a giant robot, which proceeded to rampage at a garbage dump instead of an army base.

If only I could tell her I love her. nbsp;If only I could close that final mile that has always stood between us.

If only I could finally set free the words that I've longed to speak, and she would turn to me and say the words I've longed to hear.

"Don't just stand there, you putz!" nbsp;She spins away from me on her work-stool. nbsp;"Get me a TV dinner out of the freezer or something!"

I don't take it personally. nbsp;I know it's just the stress talking. nbsp;She's been having a rough time lately, just like the rest of the mad scientist community.

Thanks a lot, terrorists.

#

In the good old days, mad scientists weren't considered public enemies like they are now. nbsp;They were tolerated, in fact, because the government loved getting its hands on their way-out inventions after their crazy schemes were thwarted.

But not anymore. nbsp;Not since the terrorists.

What difference is there between a politically motivated insane genius and one who is motivated by greed?

How can the government go after one group of people threatening to blow things up and not the other?

It can't.

As a result, business has dropped off considerably. nbsp;No one will negotiate in good faith with a mad scientist anymore. nbsp;Instead of musclebound private citizen thrill-seekers coming after us, we get black ops Special Forces and heat-seeking bunker-buster missiles courtesy of Homeland Security.

It's a tough time to be a mad scientist. nbsp;Lots of them have quit already and become street people or college professors.

But not my Hildegarde. nbsp;She won't give up that easily. Being a mad scientist has been her lifelong dream.

I know, because I grew up with...</ns2:summary>

It is sunset.nbsp; The sky is splendid through the panes of my bedroom window; billowing layers of cumulous blazing with refracted oranges and reds.nbsp; I think if only it werenrsquo;t for the glass, I could reach out and touch the cloudscape, perhaps leave my own trail of turbulence in the swirling patterns that will soon deepen to indigo.

But the window is there, and I feel trapped.

Behind me my parents and a specialist from the neurological research institute are sitting on folding chairs theyrsquo;ve brought in from the kitchen, quietly discussing my future.nbsp; They do not know I am listening.nbsp; They think that, because I do not choose to respond,nbsp; I do not notice they are there.

ldquo;Would there be side effects?rdquo; My father asks.nbsp; In the oppressive heat of the evening, I hear the quiet Zzzapof his shoulder laser as it targets mosquitoes.nbsp; The device is not as effective as it was two years ago: the mosquitoes are getting faster.

My father is a believer in technology, and that is why he contacted the research institute.nbsp; He wants to fix me.nbsp; He is certain there is a way.

ldquo;There would be no side effects in the traditional sense,rdquo;the specialist says.nbsp; I like him even though his presence makes me uncomfortable.nbsp; He chooses his words very precisely.nbsp; ldquo;Wersquo;re talking about direct synaptic grafting, not drugs.nbsp; The process is akin to bending a sapling to influence the shape of the grown tree.nbsp; We boost the strength of key dendritic connections and allow brain development to continue naturally. Young neurons are very malleable.rdquo;

ldquo;And yoursquo;ve done this before?rdquo;nbsp; I do not have to look to know my mother is frowning.

My mother does not trust technology.nbsp; She has spent the last ten years trying to coax me into social behavior by gentler means.nbsp; She loves me, but she does not understand me.nbsp; She thinks I cannot be happy unless I am smiling and laughing and running along the beach with other teenagers.

ldquo;The procedure is still new, but our first subject was a young woman about the same age as your daughter.nbsp; Afterwards, she integrated wonderfully.nbsp; She was never an exceptional student, but she began speaking more and had an easier time following classroom procedure.rdquo;

ldquo;What about Hannahrsquo;s...talents?rdquo;my mother asks.nbsp; I know she is thinking about my dancing; also the way I remember facts and numbers without trying. ldquo;Would she lose those?rdquo;

The specialistrsquo;s voice is very firm, and I like the way he delivers the facts without trying to cushion them.nbsp; ldquo;Itrsquo;s a matter of trade-offs, Mrs. Didier.nbsp; The brain cannot be optimized for everything at once.nbsp; Without treatment, some children like Hannah develop into extraordinary individuals. They become famous, change the world, learn to integrate their abilities into the structures of society.nbsp; But only a very few are that lucky. The others never learn to make friends, hold a job, or live outside of institutions.rdquo;

ldquo;And... with treatment?rdquo;

ldquo;I cannot promise anything, but the chances are very good that Hannah will lead a normal life.rdquo;

I have pressed my hand to the window.nbsp; The glass feels cold and smooth beneath my palm.nbsp; It appears motionless although I know at the molecular level it is flowing.nbsp; Its atoms slide past each other slowly, so slowly; a transformation no less inevitable for its tempo.nbsp; I like glass -- also stone -- because it does not change very quickly.nbsp; I will be dead, and so will all of my relatives and their descendants, before the deformations will be visible without a microscope.

I feel my motherrsquo;s hands...</ns2:summary>

This one is a long one! This is considered appropriate for kids 12 and up - it's a YA story with one murder.

Clockwork Fagin
By Cory Doctorow

Monty Goldfarb walked into St Agatha's like he owned the place, a superior look on the half of his face that was still intact, a spring in his step despite his  steel left leg. And it wasn't long before he *did* own the place, taken it over by simple murder and cunning artifice. It wasn't long before he was my best friend and my master, too, and the master of all St Agatha's, and didn't he preside over a *golden* era in the history of that miserable place?

I've lived in St Agatha's for six years, since I was 11 years old, when a reciprocating gear in the Muddy York Hall of Computing took off my right arm at the elbow. My Da had sent me off to Muddy York when Ma died of the consumption. He'd sold me into service of the Computers and I'd thrived in the big city, hadn't cried, not even once, not even when Master Saunders beat me for playing kick-the-can with the other boys when I was meant to be polishing the brass.  I didn't cry when I lost my arm, nor when the barber-surgeon clamped me off and burned my stump with his medicinal tar.

I've seen every kind of boy and girl come to St Aggie's -- swaggering, scared, tough, meek. The burned ones are often the hardest to read, inscrutable beneath their scars. Old Grinder don't care, though, not one bit. Angry or scared, burned and hobbling or swaggering and full of beans, the first thing he does when new meat turns up on his doorstep is tenderize it a little. That means a good long session with the belt -- and Grinder doesn't care where the strap lands, whole skin or fresh scars, it's all the same to him -- and then a night or two down the hole, where there's no light and no warmth and nothing for company except for the big hairy Muddy York rats who'll come and nibble at whatever's left of you if you manage to fall asleep. It's the blood, see, it draws them out.



So there we all was, that first night when Monty Goldfarb turned up, dropped off by a pair of sour-faced Sisters in white capes who turned their noses up at the smell of the horse-droppings as they stepped out of their coal-fired banger and handed Monty over to Grinder, who smiled and dry-washed his hairy hands and promised, "Oh, aye, sisters, I shall look after this poor crippled birdie like he was my own get. We'll be great friends, won't we, Monty?" Monty actually laughed when Grinder said that, like he'd already winkled it out.

As soon as the boiler on the sisters' car had its head of steam up and they were clanking away, Grinder took Monty inside, leading him past the parlour where we all sat, quiet as mice, eyeless or armless, shy a leg or half a face, or even a scalp (as was little Gertie Shine-Pate, whose hair got caught in the mighty rollers of one of the pressing engines down at the logic mill in Cabbagetown).

He gave us a jaunty wave as Grinder led him away, and I'm ashamed to say that none of us had the stuff to wave back at him, or even to shout a warning. Grinder had done his work on us, too true, and turned us from kids into cowards.

Presently, we heard the whistle and slap of the strap, but instead of screams of agony, we heard howls of defiance, and yes, even laughter!

"Is that the best you have, you greasy old sack of suet? Put some arm into it!"

And then: "Oh, dearie me, you must be tiring of your work. See how the sweat runs down your face, how your tongue doth protrude from your stinking gob. Oh please, dear master, tell me your pathetic old ticker isn't about to pack it in, I don't know what I'd do if you dropped dead here on the floor before me!"

And then: "Your chest heaves like a bell</ns2:summary>

This one isn't for the kids, because of language and heavy content.

Site Fourteen

"Nereus Shuttle Four to Gateway Station, you have control."

Robinachec nodded confirmation as though the pilot could see him.nbsp;nbsp;"Roger that.nbsp;nbsp;Bringing you in."nbsp;Palming the flat-topped lever, I watched as he moved it gently back towards him, pulling the bullet-shaped transport into the shed, an external framework of metal beams just large enough to hold two minisubs, or one shuttle.

Robinechec has nightmares sometimes about something going wrong here.nbsp;nbsp;Forget the fact that it's the safest maneuver in the entire procedure; he still talks about waking up in a cold sweat because he screwed up.

You'd never know it to watch him.

When you're six hundred feet down ndash; well below the twilight zone, in the bathypelagic or 'deep water' zone-- your perception shifts.nbsp;nbsp;Nothing as arcane as the chemical balance in your brain changing, although there's some of that, too.nbsp;nbsp;No, it's more the realization, slow sinking into your brain, that there's not damn-all between you and dying but a duraplas shield and some canned oxy-blend.

You realize that, really process the concept, and you're okay.nbsp;nbsp;If you can't, you get the screamin' meemies and they cart you Topside where you spend the rest of your life on solid dirt, carefully looking anywhere but ocean-ward.

Not everyone's cut out to be an aquanaut. No shame to it.nbsp;nbsp;Even now, only about a third of the applicants make it into training, and more than half of them dry out before graduation.</ns2:summary>

Hello everyone, and happy November!

Itrsquo;s	NaNoWriMo	month,	and	a	lot	of	professionals	donrsquo;t	like	it.	They	say	itrsquo;s	misleading	to	tell	newbies	that	the	career	that	pros	have	taken	years	to	perfect	can	be	achieved	in	30	days.	They	say	that	December	1	marks	the	day	that	thousands	of	unedited,	50,000	word	ldquo;novelsrdquo;	hit	the	desks	of	agents	and	editors.	Some	of	them	are	just	cynics	who	hate	the	excitement	people	get	as	November	draws	near,	since	theyrsquo;re	toiling	on	their	own	books.

But	I	tend	to	think	itrsquo;s	a	great	thing.	Writing	well	is	difficult,	yes.	But	writing	is	not.	And	most	people	just	stop	themselves	at	writing,	thinking	if	their	story	isnrsquo;t	flat	out	brilliant	literature	from	word	one,	they	will	never	improve,	never	learn,	and	never	be	a	writer.	NaNoWriMo	tells	people	to	turn	off	the	horrid	editor	in	our	minds	and	just	write-	something	thatrsquo;s	difficult	to	do.	Pros	know	for	a	fact	that	therersquo;s	always	a	lurking	voice	saying,	ldquo;This	is	crap,	why	are	you	wasting	your	time	with	tripe?rdquo;	-	they	just	know	to	tell	that	voice	to	shut	up,	that	theyrsquo;ll	get	their	opinion	once	the	story	is	done.

Most	of	all	for	me,	NaNoWriMo	encourages	people	to	write	-	and	write	every	day.	And	at	the	core	of	things,	I	really	canrsquo;t	see	what	kind	of	ogre	thinks	this	is	a	bad	idea.	Writing	is	a	great	thing.	More	writers	means	more	stories.	And	last	I	checked,	we	still	liked	stories.	So	participate	in	NaNoWriMo.	Write	a	50,000	word	story	in	a	month.	Then	let	it	sit.	Then	edit	it.	Then	edit	it	again.	Learn	from	every	step.

In	other	news,	I	just	returned	from	World	Fantasy	Con,	which	was	my	first.	It	was	a	fantastic	meeting	of	industry	professionals,	and	I	met	a	lot	of	great	authors	and	narrators	that	have	appeared	in	Escape	Pod,	Podcastle,	and	Pseudopod.	(To	name	a	few:	Cat	Rambo,	K.	Tempest	Bradford,	Keffy	R.	M.	Kehrli,	M.	K.	Hobson,	Vylar	Kaftan,	and	several	more.)		During	the	Escape	Artistsrsquo;	meetup,	we	managed	to	discuss	fanfic,	Elmo,	and	the	Escape	Artists	forums.	In	retrospect	perhaps	we	should	have	served	alcohol.	Ah	well.	It	was	fantastic	meeting	people,	and	cons	are	over	too	quickly.

The	last	two	months	of	the	year	have	some	really	exciting	stories	planned,	and	I	canrsquo;t	wait	to	bring	them	to	you.

Be	mighty!

This one isn't for the kids, because of references to sex workers and acts.

Boxed In
by Marc-Anthony Taylor

My sister had me boxed when I was four. She said she would have had it done to herself but she didn't want to risk losing me, that it was the only way. I think she just hated the idea of renting her body out to the rich folk in the domes. Don't get me wrong, she did good by me, I didn't have to work till I was nine and in that time she studied hard and became a data-pimp herself.

It was the only way she could keep us housed and fed after mum and dad had died.

It must have been hard for her, if mum and dad had made it she might have made something of herself. If she hadnrsquo;t have had to look after me she would probably be in a dome herself by now.

She once told me she had big plans; that she wanted to make things better. My only plan was to make enough cash to get us both out of the business.

I never noticed the tiny implant at the base of my skull, the nano circuitry must be some of the best though, the tattoo circling my right eye is almost perfect.

Kara controlled who, what, when and where. She made sure we got paid, and that I didn't do anything too bad. She was a clever cookie.

My sister looked after me. She did good.

*

Black leaves hung limply from the trees, refusing to fall despite the time of year. We were lucky to have trees at all; there were places on the other side of the city that had nothing living, except perhaps the odd person. Or so I was told, I had never ventured that far out and thankfully none of my clients had ever requested it.

Kara didnrsquo;t think it was right to use vehicles. Even if they were meant to be eco friendly now. We would only ever use them if it was an emergency, she said. Everywhere I went, I went by foot, and I had come to know the city just as well as the grubby little apartment that my sister and I shared.

My boots left imprints in the fine black powder that coated everything. The sky ships were under way again, every six months they would come out for a week, their massive air scrubbers extracting the carbon from the COsup2;, supposedly leaving us with fresher air. Most people believed they took the oxygen and pumped it into the Eden-domes. The carbon was probably used to construct whatever they needed. The dust was excess that happened to shake loose from the giant machines.

Already a couple of people were out with their vacuum cleaners, sucking up what they could of the carbon to sell on the black market. One or two had even rushed out with brush and pan in hand, carefully shaking their winnings into plastic bags.

Kara had never done that, she said once we started collecting that stuff, it wouldn't be long till we started getting sloppy and before you know it our lungs would be coated in gunk, bringing us that much closer to death. My sister, always the optimist.

The mask I was wearing was about three years old, long past its renewal date but Kara had kept it in good working order, another one of her many talents. She knew how to break the manufacturing codes so she could regulate the functions. She would probably have been some big-shot programmer or hacker back in the old days. Now, she was just a skin-flint.

"We gotta save our cash kid. Money doesn't fall from the sky, no matter what the carbon monkeys think. And besides, we don't repeat the mistakes of the past Nate, that's what got us all into this mess. Recycling is the way to go baby bro, and if I can fix it, you'll use it. 'K?" She was always coming out with stuff like that. It might have helped if I had gone to school like her, but they stopped taking boxed kids not long after I got mine. Bad influence supposedly.

Still, I could feel a rasp star...</ns2:summary>

The Prize Beyond Gold
by Ian Creasey

Three days before the race, when Delroy had finished warming down from a
training run, his coach summoned him for a talk.  Delroy could tell it was
something big.  Michito's job -- assisted by his Enhanced empathy -- was to
become exquisitely sensitive to his athlete's mood, so as to help get the
best out of him.  The attunement sometimes became mutual, and Delroy now
discerned a rare eagerness in Michito's almost-natural face.

"The weather forecast for race day has reached certainty," said Michito.
"Temperature: perfect.  Humidity: perfect.  Wind speed: just below the
permissible maximum.  Wind direction --"

"Perfect?" said Delroy.

"Behind you all the way."  Michito grinned in delight.  "It's the final star
in the constellation.  You're in great shape, the weather will be ideal,
we're two thousand metres above sea level" -- Michito made a sweeping
gesture, encompassing the many other factors affecting performance -- "and
it all adds up to one thing."

"I'm going to win?"  Delroy didn't understand Michito's glee: the weather
would be the same for all the runners.

"Yes, but never mind that.  Forget winning -- you have a chance at the
record!"

Michito paused to let it sink in.  Records were something that athletes and
coaches normally never discussed, because they'd stood so long that they
were effectively unbeatable.  The record for the men's 100 metres had
remained at 8.341 seconds for the past seventy years.

A pulse of exhilaration surged through Delroy.  His posture stiffened, as if
already preparing for the starting gun.  "Really?  The world record?"

"Yes, the one and only.  The prize beyond gold."

Michito's excitement spilled out, infecting Delroy, whose own excitement
blazed in return and stoked a feedback loop.  They were practically getting
high on it.  Indeed, this giddy rush was as close to getting high as Delroy
had ever experienced.  In his entire life he'd never once taken any kind of
drug.  The rules were strict on that, as on so many other things.

Abruptly, Michito reverted to his habitual seriousness.  "A chance, I said.
A real chance.  But only if everything's as smooth as an angel's feather.
We need absolute perfection.  There can be no deviations, no distractions."

This was standard rhetoric for any important race.  Yet Michito's demeanour
indicated something beyond the usual rigorous regime.

"I think it would be best if you stayed here at the training ground,"
Michito went on, "instead of going back to the villa tonight.  This is a
more controlled environment, with much less risk --"

"What could possibly happen to me?"

"I want to keep you away from other people, and it's easier to do that here.
You'll be in purdah, seeing no-one except your coaching team.  I know it'll
be frustrating, but it's only three days."

Delroy grimaced, though he didn't argue.  Michito knew what was best.  Aside
from the usual health and attractiveness tweaks, Michito's main Enhancement
was an uncanny empathy that let him predict Delroy's responses, and thus
determine the optimum conditions for success.  If he felt purdah was
necessary, then it must be necessary.  It was only another line in the
script Delroy had been following all his life.

The script had two phases, as familiar as his two legs.  Sometimes, when he
rehearsed stride patterns out on the track, the script echoed in his head
with every step: left, right; left, right -- race, train; race, train....

Michito said, "This is bigger than any medal.  The Olympics are like a moon
that's always in the sky, waxing every four years; but the record is a comet
that blazes just once across the heavens, before disappearing forever.  This
could be the only time in your career when all the right circumstances</ns2:summary>

Driving X
by Gwendolyn Clare

Carmela wouldn't have stopped if she had known that the kid was still alive.

She spotted the body lying under a creosote bush, maybe ten yards from
the road, and she hit the brakes. nbsp;She grabbed the roll cage of the
old dune buggy and pulled herself up, standing on the driver's seat to
scan in both directions along the unpaved road. nbsp;A dust devil twirled
a silent ballet off to the southeast, but hers was the only man-made
dust trail in evidence for miles. nbsp;She raised her hand to cover the
sun and squinted into the bleached, cloudless sky--no vultures yet,
which was good, since vultures attract attention. nbsp;Minimal risk, she
decided.

The dune buggy itself wasn't that valuable, but the newer-model solar
panels powering it would be enough to tempt any sane person, and the
carboys of potable water were worth a small fortune out here.

Carmela swung out of the dune buggy and jogged over to check out the
body. nbsp;It was tall but skinny, with the not-yet-filled-out look of a
teenager. nbsp;Pale skin, a tint of sunburn, brown hair cropped at
chin-length. nbsp;The girl was lying face down in the dust, so Carmela
rolled the body over and checked her front pockets for anything of
interest. nbsp;A month ago, she would have felt ashamed, but scavenging
was the norm down here; after all, dead people don't miss what you
take from them.

Carmela was rifling through the kid's backpack--shaking her head about
the nearly empty water supply--when she heard the girl moan.

She froze, one hand still buried in the bag. nbsp;She should gather up the
loot and make a run for the dune buggy before the girl came around.
The kid was probably a goner, anyway, she told herself. nbsp;Instead, she
leaned in closer, looking at the face plastered with sand and sweaty
clumps of brown hair.

The girl's eyelids peeled back and stared up at Carmela with the
glazed slowness of delirium. nbsp;Her cracked lips parted and she said,
hoarsely, "Mom?"

Nobody had ever called Carmela that before. nbsp;She slid her hands under
the girl's shoulders to lift her.

#

Swinging her legs, nine-year-old Carmela knocked her heels lightly
against the side of the exam table. nbsp;Mama sat in a plastic chair,
flipping through a magazine the way she always did when she was
getting impatient. nbsp;Carmela's test result had come in, and for some
reason that was beyond her, Mama was really nervous about it. nbsp;And the
doctor was running late.

Carmela didn't know why Mama was all bent out of shape over the
non-Mendelian genetic test. nbsp;To be fair, she wasn't entirely sure what
"non-Mendelian" meant, except that it was something bad that your
genes could be. nbsp;Driving X was a chromosome that was bad that way, and
pretty much everybody had it, and for some reason you had to get
tested for it anyway. nbsp;That's what Carmela knew.

Dr. Tanaka entered the exam room, holding a manila folder to her
chest. nbsp;"Afternoon Ms. Perez, Carmela. nbsp;Sorry to keep you waiting."

Mama dropped the magazine on the floor next to her chair and stood,
fingers knotted together nervously. nbsp;"Well?"

Dr. Tanaka opened the folder, took out a single sheet of paper, and
handed it to Mama. nbsp;Mama stared at it for a long minute, like she
couldn't quite see it properly. nbsp;She made a choking noise.

In her tight, mustn't-cry-in-public voice, she said, "I'll be right
back." nbsp;She left the paper on her chair and hurried for the door.

Carmela hopped off the exam table and picked up the sheet of paper.
It had a lot of gobbledygook on it, but right in the middle, in bold,
it read, "XDXD".

She didn't understand what the big deal was. nbsp;Pretty much everybody
had the Driving X allele on at least one o...</ns2:summary>

Thanksgiving Day
By Jay Werkheiser

Kev's stomach curled around emptiness, embracing it as a constant reminder that the colony's Earth food was almost gone.  Another three months, four at the outside.  Then what?  How will we die?

He bent down to look into the nearest cage.  "Maybe you'll tell us why the food here is poisonous," he said to one of the rats inside.  It rolled its dull eyes listlessly toward him.  Rust-brown clumps matted its fur, and the metallic odor of dried blood hung in the air.

Is that how I'll go, clutching helplessly at alien dirt, coughing up blood?  His gut clenched tighter.

"They are not going to tell you anything," Ahmet said from across the toxicology lab.

Kev looked up from the cage at the short, dark-skinned man walking toward him.  His circular glasses, perched atop a narrow nose, reminded Kev of an owl.  "I thought I'd stop by on the way home from the analytical chem lab," Kev said.  "One of the grunts said you were looking for me earlier."

Ahmet nodded.  "I was hoping you could run some samples for me.  Give me a clue what's in them."

Kev frowned.  "The biochem team has me running Bradford assays day and night, looking for alien proteins.  Did you come up with a new lead?"  Hope flared in his chest, then died with Ahmet's reply.

"I'm afraid I'm just grasping at straws.  My subchronic rats keep developing the same symptoms -- nosebleed, bloody stools, and ultimately internal hemorrhaging."

"Subchronic?" said Kev, quizzically.  "My field's spectroscopy."

"The subjects receive daily doses of an alien food source over ten percent of their life span, about three months for rats."

"Three months?" Kev said.  "The hydroponics tanks are dying, Ahmet."

"Yes, I understand that.  You're not the only one living on short rations."  Anger flashed behind Ahmet's glasses, but quickly dissipated.  "Toxicology is a slow business.  I don't think we're going to have results in time."  Ahmet seemed to deflate with his anger.  "We came all this way, spent all those years on the ship, to fail before we even get started."

Kev put his hand on Ahmet's shoulder.  "We're not going down without a fight."

Ahmet nodded, his eyes downcast.  "I have learned that mycowood produced the most severe symptoms in the rats."

"Mycowood?  They're those mushroom-shaped tree things, right?  Smell minty."

"Yes.  The organic team tells me the smell comes from salicylate esters.  All the local plants produce them."

Kev connected the dots.  Salicylates.  Aspirin.  "Blood thinners?" he asked.

Ahmet's head bobbled up and down.  "But only dangerous in quantities much larger than we find here.  Still, I think it could be important."

"All right, send some of your mycowood samples over to the analyt lab.  I'll squeeze them in first thing in the morning."

"Thank you.  Thank you!"  Ahmet's Turkish accent was normally muted, but it thickened when he was excited.  "That will be most helpful."

"Save your enthusiasm for tomorrow."  A thin smile curled Kev's lips, his first in a long time.  "It's nearly fourteen o'clock, time to head home for a few hours' sleep."

The short walk across the colony compound felt longer because Epsilon Indi, settling low on the horizon at this late hour, cast bright sunbeams into his eyes.  Two long shadows moved through the glare ahead of him.  Kev shielded his eyes with his hand to see who it was -- two grunts working late in the reactor building.

He hated the way the word grunt had become a part of the colony's lexicon.  He cringed inwardly, remembering that he'd used it himself in the tox lab.  It's hard to fight human nature.

But he could try.  He waited until he could see the nearest worker.  "Hi, Logan."

Logan lifted his form straight upright, elevating his square jaw so that it was level with</ns2:summary>

You know that column you run into every now and then on how time always seems like itrsquo;s going faster as you get older? The one where you can kind of tell that the columnist suddenly realized he hadnrsquo;t actually written their weekly twelve column inches and was asking themselves how exactly Tuesday afternoon had arrived on them already (or a TV columnnist for that matter mdash; the first time I ran into it I think I was 7 or 8 and my parents were watching 60 Minutes).

Yeah, itrsquo;s kind of been like that lately. I think with Christmas/Hanukkah/[insert midwinter celebration of choice]/Festivus coming up and the rapid shortening of days ahead of the solstice, at least for those of us in the Northern Hemisphere, breed a feeling of loss at the time we had, but really would like to have again. Not quite nostalia, more like (part of me wants to write now-stalgia, but that would be a horribly disqualifying pun) the loss of the recent past that you really wanted to have accomplished more in.

Time travelrsquo;s usually all about meeting your grandkids to the nth degree and playing with their cool new gadgets/seeing the future dystopia/utopia/stealing a book of sports statistics, or going back and killing Hitler. But commercial and commoditized time travel would probably just be a bunch of people trying to optimize the days that didnrsquo;t go horribly wrong, but didnrsquo;t approach the theoretical ur-day that modern days rarely meet.

Wersquo;d all make our deadlines, but would be 90 years old after 35 calendar years.

And with that, Irsquo;ll let you peruse our fine stories this month. For those of you who NaNoWriMorsquo;d last month, I hope yoursquo;re recovering.

Honor Killing
by Ray Tabler

You would think that after all the years I've spent schlepping cargoes around the galaxy I'd have learned not to get involved with the locals, especially when they're not humans. You would think.

A Yanuleen sat down across the table from me in a bar at the edge of the landing field outside of Yanult's largest city. Yanuleen are furry little
folk, bipedal and about a meter tall with six multi-jointed arms poking out at odd intervals around their middles. This one blinked beady, black eyes at me, "Greetings Sentient Being."

"Uh, greetings."

"Isn't it a glorious piece?" My new buddy pointed an arm at the artwork on display in the middle of the bar.

Yanuleen are a bit nuts for that type of thing. They have artwork, mainly sculpture, everywhere, even in a bar. To me it just looked like a three-meter tall bundle of twigs with pieces of broken pottery tossed in at random.

"Very nice." Being in a foul mood, I took a drink and stared at the Yanuleen.

"Here is being Klonoon." He pointed all six arms at himself, in the manner of his kind. "Might here also being Captain Anne Katya Shim, who is having a cargo of entertainment modules impounded by the Port Authority?"


"Yeah, that's me. What's it to ya, shorty?" This twerp was starting to get on my nerves.

"Great amounts of good fortune we are both having. Klonoon is searching many establishments near the spaceport for Captain Anne Katya Shim."

"Well, you found me. What next?"

"Next is being Klonoon and Captain Anne Katya Shim discussing matters of mutual benefit."

"And just what matters might those be?"

Klonoon is having much influence with the official in charge of impounding cargoes."

Suddenly, my old buddy Klonoon wasn't near as annoying as a few minutes ago.

Captain Anne Katya Shim is helping Klonoon and Klonoon is helping Captain Anne--"

"Just call me Anne, okay? And get to the point."

Klonoon's whole body wriggled, which I think meant he was laughing, or maybe getting ready to vomit. I hadn't planned on being on that damned planet for more than a day or two, so I hadn't studied the culture much.

"Klonoon is getting assets unfrozen so Anne is getting paid for delivery of cargo."

"And what is Anne doing-- I mean, what is it you want me to do in return?"

"Anne is killing Klonoon's cousin Jerbot."

It was my turn to blink. "Anne is what?"

"Klonoon's cousin Jerbot is needing to be killed. It is being a matter of honor."

"I don't care if it is a matter of honor. Murder's illegal and I don't want to end up in prison."

"No. No. Yes. Yes. Murder is being illegal. Honor killings are being different."

Now, right here is when I should have stood up and stormed out.

"If that's the case, why don't you just kill Jerbot yourself?"

Klonoon pulled all three arms in on one side and stuck the others straight out. "Klonoon is not doing that! The one who is killing Jerbot is taking Jerbot's dishonor on himself."

"Oh well, that's logical."

"Yes, very. Off-worlders are having no honor. And, Humans are being particularly violent. Anne is probably killing sixes of sentient beings, perhaps sixes of sixes."

"What do you mean we're violent?"

"Humans are having many wars. You are having your War of First Contact, your Altair War, your War of the Outer Rift, your--"

"All right, all right, we've had a lot of wars. At least we're not as bad as the Hestolians."

"If any Hestolians are being on Yanult with impounded cargoes Klonoon is talking to them. Here is only being Anne on Yanult with an impounded cargo."

Klonoon stood up and slid a data cube across the table top. "Time is being not much left. Here is where Jerbot is being. Anne is killing Jerbot. Klonoon is solving Anne's problem."

		<description>The assassination of JFK was a watershed event in human history, one that many people believe should never have happened. In Stephen King's new novel, &lt;i&gt;11/22/63&lt;/i&gt;, we learn that, no matter what we think should've happened, history is a pretty powerful force and it doesn't want to be changed.</description>

Chicken Noodle Gravity
by J. Daniel Sawyer

I hate to start out this way, but before we get to the reason I'm  standing on this stool with a fez on my head, in the middle of the  night, in front of a double-cal-king bed in a furniture storemdash;which,  yes, Officer, I swear I'll confess I broke into illegallymdash;before we get  to any of that, there's something I have to tell you. I know it's awful,  evil, and just plain wrong, but there's no way around it, and you won't  understand anything else unless I say this right up front, so here  goes:

Stephen was stoned.

And when I say ldquo;stonedrdquo; I mean he'd eaten enough brownies and smoked  enough pot to put the economies of five or six minor countries into a  severe, long-term deficit crisis.

It was okay. It helped him cope with the chemo. Mellowed him out. We  didn't have to fight over who got to hold the remote. He was better in  bed toomdash;not as neurotic.

Didn't complain about my mustache when I kissed  him. Suits me right for shacking up with a clean freak.

The weed was my revengemdash;well, the fact that the weed made it possible  for him to eat. We had to grow our ownmdash;only way we could afford it,  though I swear we probably spent as much on the electricity as we would  have on the bud. Not a great climate for it, not in the winter.

So, the revenge partmdash;that would be his appetite. When he smoked, it  came back. It was the only time it came back. And there were only two  things he could handle:

Brownies.

And chicken noodle soup. The really rancid stuff that came in a red and white can.

I swear, by all that's good and holy and a bowl of Ex-Lax besides, that  was all he could eat. And he hated chocolate almost as much as he  hated the soup. Feeding him the soup and brownies was my revenge on him  for getting sick in the first place.

Not that I blamed him about the soup. A hundred forty years after it  was invented, that stuff still smelled like salted famine and disease  glopping out of the can.

But after Stephen lost all his hair, for the third time, I got to love  that smell. Not because it smelled any better, but because every time I  smelled it I knew he'd be around at least long enough to eat it.  Sometimes, a little bit of hope is all you need to keep going. When your  life is filled with words like ldquo;pancreatic,rdquo; ldquo;stage four,rdquo; and  ldquo;terminal,rdquo; you learn to live with what you can get.

So we smoked like chimneys, screwed like carpenters, sang like sailors,  and gambled like day-traders. I didn't give much of a damn that the  money wouldn't last much longer than him.

But he just. Kept. Lasting. He didn't want to let me go any more than I wanted to let him go.

First it was the money. Then it was the house. Then it was the car. But  it didn't matter. As long as I could keep growing the green, and  opening those red and white cans.

It went on like that all winter. When they diagnosed him, they said  he'd last five weeks. We'd made it five months, and we weren't going to  make it much longer without changingmdash;and whatever it was, we were going  to have to get creative. I was still employed. My job at the casino paid  enough in tips that we should have been okay, and my insurance covered  all his doctor visits. But the meds killed us. Cancer drugs move so fast  that the difference in survival comes down to what month you were  diagnosed, now. That small-cell lung cancer you've got today will kill  you, but the tumor your brother discovers in six weeks will be  treatable, and the one your mom gets a month after that will be curable.

If you can stay alive long enough, then you can stay alive period.  That's the deal. And that's why every penny I earned in sal...</ns2:summary>

Marking Time on the Far Side of Forever
by D.K. Latta

I sit beneath the dark green sky, overlooking the valley that has changed much over the years.nbsp; What was once a stream has swelled into a river while, to the east, lush vegetation grows where I think there was once a shallow lake. I can't remember definitely. The information is stored inside me, filed, itemized; I'm merely unsure how to access it. It will come to me. Later, when a random search, an unrelated thought, cracks open the proper conduits and a pulse of electricity resurrects the knowledge, unbidden.

Until then, I am content to wait.

Below my knee, the dented brass-coloured metal becomes the red of a tree trunk, substituting as a shin and foot. Like an antiquated peg-leg, like a stereotypical pira...pi...pi-

Pi is 3.1415926...

The organic substance must be replaced occasionally, but the concept has served satisfactorily for almost two hundred years. It was easy to jury-rig. Not so my mnemonic core.nbsp; I lack the appropriate tools and diagnostic programs.

Yes. There had been a lake, teeming with the hoorah-thet fish.

I call them fish simply to provide a basis of comparative orientation. Fish only exist on earth, and this is not earth.nbsp; Earth is a long, long way away.

"Gakha!"

I turn my head left, but abruptly the joints seize up. The swivel mechanism has been malfunctioning for months. Fiffer comes bounding through the long red stalks that sprout to the height of a man. The sun is setting, and when night settles the stalks will curl up until the first rays of morning buss them with its solar kiss.

I'm being florid. Dr. Fujiwama programmed me that way. She said it would make my information easier to digest for the scouting party.

My left eye starts pixilating, turning everything into a multi-coloured grid. I slap my palm against my brow with a dull clang! and the image clears.

Who is bounding toward me? Do I know him?

Fiffer.

He bounces along on his powerful tail, his four lower limbs atrophied to stumps. I've unearthed fossils indicating that his ancestors had well-developed hind limbs. I think the scouting party will be pleased with my report on paleozoology. There are some nice passages in it. Florid even.

Fiffer calls me Gakha, which means 'shelled man'. They do not comprehend refined metals. Fiffer's people think I'm some sort of god. I've tried to disabuse them of that notion.

Fiffer halts, his principle forelimb gesticulating. The limb is a tongue that has evolved through the chest cavity. I detail its evolution in my report on Comparative Anatomies of the Vertebrates of the Temperate Zone. It was my first completed essay. I'm proud to say my observations within it have not been contradicted by subsequent data collected in the ensuing years. I was very meticulous.

"Gakha?"

I focus, realizing I may have drifted. "Has a grubbling fallen into a well?" I rise, prepared to rescue the little creature.

"No." His tongue waves excitedly. "A shell has fallen."

My left eye pixilates momentarily. I ignore it. "What?"

"A big shell. It was bright at its bottom as it fell from the sky. Then it landed and went dark."

"Shell?" Slowly, I consider: shell equals refined metals. "Show me, please."

*nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; *nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; *

It's a ship. I don't recognize the design. I lurch toward it in fits and starts through the swamp. I have sent Fiffer back to the village, until I can ascertain whether the inhabitants of the shell -- I mean, ship -- whether they mean his people harm. It is important that no harm come to them. The scouting party will want to meet them.

In the nightsky I recognize the purple glimmer of a planet that shares the same sun. It is uninhabited, though mig...</ns2:summary>

Nothing objectionable in this episode, except it may not be appropriate for the younger folk, as the story does discuss Santy Clawr.

Long Winter's Nap
by Catherine H. Shaffer

ldquo;Eat,rdquo; said MooninMama, ldquo;You have a long winter ahead.rdquo; LittlestOne turned her head away as MooninMama lifted the spoon of raspberry pie dripping with honey and caribou fat. LittlestOne was sleepy, too sleepy, for what she planned.

ldquo;I am already full,rdquo; said LittlestOne. Her stomach rumbled, giving away her lie.

MooninMama shrugged and set the plate away. It was beginning to get cold in the cave as the crackling fire burned down to embers. Soon it would be time to sleep, time to dream of spring, when they would awaken, shivering, and find that Santy Clawr had visited them.


MooninMama lay next to YediDaddy and pulled LittlestOne down between them, like a baby. All of the others had their own beds.

The hardest part was lying still between MooninMama and YediDaddy without falling asleep. It wasnrsquo;t like going to sleep at night. There were no blankets to keep them warm, though they had soft beds. More than once, LittlestOne shook herself awake after accidentally nodding off. She wasnrsquo;t sure she could fight off the long sleep by simple force of will, not with the cold coming down into her bones.

She peeked out from beneath her heavy lids and the cave was dark except for the thin, crackly lines of orange from the dying embers in the fire pit. The taste of sugar rose to her tongue and her hands and feet began to tingle.

MooninMama was still, her breath coming softer and fainter each time. Her bright blue eyes were closed and her cheek as soft as a babyrsquo;s. Chestnut hair fanned around her shoulders. Her breasts rose and fell softly with her breath. YediDaddy wasnrsquo;t breathing at all. There was a faint beard of frost on his face, decorating the stubble on his chin. All around lay LittlestOnersquo;s brothers and sisters, their children, her aunts and uncles and cousins, her grandparents, and all the other people of the tribe.

In the summer, when the tribe slept, there were all sorts of sounds in the night. People coughing, snoring, and sometimes laughing, but here there was nothing but a deep silence.

LittlestOne stood up and shook the tingling out. She felt a pang of longing looking at her parents hibernating, but it wasnrsquo;t enough to keep her with them. She turned to sneak out. She felt dizzy and stumbled several times as she tiptoed across the sleeping bodies of her tribe. Nothing would wake them now but Spring.

LittlestOne crawled out of the cave and went to the summer house that YediDaddy had built. She lit a fire and crouched beside it. When she felt completely awake, she went out into the night. It was snowing softly, and there werenrsquo;t any stars. She had never been so alone.

But she resisted the temptation to go back to the cave with her family. She imagined what they would say when she told them she had met Santy Clawr. They wouldnrsquo;t think she was such a baby, then!

#

The days were lonely for LittlestOne. It grew colder and all she wanted to do was go to sleep. Many times she woke herself just on the verge of hibernation , and had to get warm again so she wouldnrsquo;t miss Santy.

She knew where to find food, even under the snow. MooninMama and YediDaddy kept caches of meat and potatoes underground, where they wouldnrsquo;t go bad. There were some nuts and berries left on the bushes, and she didnrsquo;t need to eat much, since she was so small.

Digging through the buried boxes, LittlestOne wondered why there was so much food, with the feast that Santy Clawr would be bringing.

To fight off the loneliness, she sat up on top of the highest hill and looked out over the wa...</ns2:summary>

SAM:  		Something about your old government.

BECCA:  	You people wasted everything. And then millions died.

SAM: 		Billions.

MEL:   	We tried.  We tried very hard.  It wasnrsquo;t as if we couldnrsquo;t see what was coming.  The droughts, tornados, the economy going south.  But it didnrsquo;t happen all at once.  Then the Raccoon flu, the antibiotics were useless.  The wheat crop failed two years in a row. Then came riots, cities on fire, madness. When we lost control we gathered the best -- scientists, economists, engineers, architects into the CPF hellip;.

SAM: 		CPF?

MEL: 	The Cultural Preservation Facility.   The vault.   The Congressional Committee selected a hundred volunteers to enter suspended animation pods to sleep through all the disasters.   Wait, how long has it been?

SAM:  		Since when?

MEL:  		I mean, what year is this?

SAM:  		Pick one.  Theyrsquo;re all available.

BECCA:  	My mom never kept a calendar.  Did yours, Sam?

SAM:  		You met my mom.

BECCA:  	Right.  So anyway, Mel, you decided to snooze while the world went to the dogs.

MEL:  	Everything was flying apart.  We tried...</ns2:summary>

Dear Faithful Listeners And Readers&#8212;
Happy 2012! It&#8217;s looking to be a very exciting year at Escape Pod, and we&#8217;re delighted you&#8217;re still hanging out with us!
We had a lot of fun bringing you different things in 2011, from our first audio drama at the end of the year to the various story collections to our supporters. And thanks to your supporters, by the way. It&#8217;s amazing to realize we&#8217;re in our seventh year doing this, and we&#8217;ve operated in the black the entire time. We couldn&#8217;t have done that without you, so thank you.
To be completely honest, it hasn&#8217;t been smooth sailing. We got behind in submissions this year, even with some time off to catch up. Authors got angry, as they should have done, and we&#8217;ve figured out where things went wrong and are working on fixing it. I won&#8217;t offer excuses, only that I&#8217;m responsible for this magazine and I let down our authors, and I&#8217;m very sorry for this. We&#8217;re closing our doors to submissions in January in order to get everything organized.
Hugo voting is open, from now until March 31! I&#8217;ll have a blog post soon about what Escape Pod has offered that is eligible, and we&#8217;re appreciate a consideration if you&#8217;re eligible to nominate.
Resolutions are promises to fail, so we won&#8217;t make any, but we do promise to continue to bring you weekly SF that will be fun. And lose those 10 pounds, of course.
Have a safe and happy 2012. Be mighty, and have fun!

REVENANTS
by Judith Tarr
Janie wanted to pet the pterodactyl.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s the auk,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Look how soft his feathers are. Look at the dodo, isn&#8217;t he funny? Don&#8217;t you want to give the quagga a carrot?&#8221;
Janie wouldn&#8217;t even dignify that with disgust. It was the pterodactyl or nothing.
Janie is four. At four, all or nothing isn&#8217;t a philosophy, it&#8217;s universal law. A very intelligent four can argue that this is the Greater Metro Revenants&#8217; Zoo, yes? And this is the room where they keep the ones that can be petted, yes? So why can&#8217;t a person pet the pterodactyl?
No use explaining that everything else was inoculated and immunized and sterilized and rendered safe for children to handle. Everything but the pterodactyl. They&#8217;d just made it, and it was supposed to be pettable when they were done, but not yet. There&#8217;d been plenty of controversy about putting it on display so soon, but public outcry won out over scientific common sense. So the thing was on display, but behind neoglas inlaid with the injunction: No, I&#8217;m Not Ready Yet. Look, But Don&#8217;t Touch.
Janie reads. I should know. It&#8217;s one of the chief points of debate between her father and me. She could read the warning as well as I could. &#8220;So why can&#8217;t I touch? I want to touch!&#8221;
She was fast winding up to a tantrum. I could stop it now and risk an injunction for public child abuse, or wait till it became a nuisance and we were both shuffled off the premises.
Inside its enclosure, the pterodactyl stretched its wings and opened its beak and hissed. Neoglas is new, about as new as revenants; it&#8217;s one-way to sound as well as sight. The pterodactyl couldn&#8217;t see us or hear us, which was lucky for Janie. I wished we couldn&#8217;t see or hear it, either.
It wasn&#8217;t particularly ugly, just strange. One whole faction of paleontologists had been thrown out into the cold when the thing came out of its vat warm-blooded and covered with soft silvery-white fur. Without the fur it would have been a leathery lizardlike thing with batwings. With the fur it looked like a white bat with a peculiar, half-avian, half-saurian head, and extremely convincing talons.
Janie&#8217;s fixation and the thing&#8217;s furriness notwithstanding, it didn&#8217;t look very pettable. Its eyes were a disturbing shade of red, with pinpoint pupils. I wondered if it was hungry, or if it wanted to stretch its wings and fly.
Janie had stopped whining. She was going to howl next.
Something bellowed in the bowels of the building. Janie&#8217;s mouth snapped shut.
&#8220;There,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Look what you did.&#8221;
If that got me cited, let it. It cut off Janie&#8217;s howl before it started.
&#8220;They&#8217;ve got something big down there,&#8221; somebody said.
&#8220;Probably the aurochs,&#8221; said somebody else.
&#8220;Mammoths trumpet like elephants.&#8221;
&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s a T. Rex,&#8221; said a kid&#8217;s voice.
&#8220;They don&#8217;t have one of those yet,&#8221; said the one who knew it all. &#8220;They&#8217;d need a bigger enclosure than they can afford to build, with a stronger perimeter field. So they&#8217;re bringing back later things, because they&#8217;re smaller.&#8221;
&#8220;But if they&#8217;ve got the mammoths&#8212;&#8221;
&#8220;Mammoths don&#8217;t have teeth as long as your arm. They don&#8217;t eat people.&#8221;
Janie&#8217;s eyes were as big as they can get. I got her out of there before she decided she wanted to howl after all.
Ice cream distracted her. So did a pony ride in the zoo&#8217;s park&#8212;the pony was a Merychippus, a handsome little dun that looked perfectly ponylike except for the pair of vestigial toes flanking each of its hooves. By the time we picked up our picnic and headed for the tables by the mammoths&#8217; pit, I was starting to breathe almost normally.
If you haven&#8217;t got your kid license yet, you can only imagine you know what it&#8217;s like to take the qualifying exam. Studying for it is hell, and the practicum&#8217;s a raving bitch. Then when you pass and get the kid, six times out o[...]</ns2:summary>

Surviving the eBookalypse
by Randy Henderson
I entered the City Public Library wearing my plastic replica chainmail and sword, and my suede &#8220;book jacket&#8221; with a laminated author&#8217;s license clipped to the collar.
Before me stood a fully automated checkout kiosk for scheduling author recitals.  The library floor beyond that was filled with neat rows of author cubicles, each with a desk and chair.  Most were occupied.  The air was filled with the soft tickity-ticking of keyboards, and the smells of coffee, &#8220;New Book&#8221; scented air fresheners, and Cup o&#8217; Soup.  Heads popped up over cubicle walls in response to the clacking of the door, then disappeared again when they saw I was no customer or potential patron.
I understood their disappointed expressions too well.  This was not at all where I thought I would be two years after publishing my first e-book.
A woman&#8217;s smile caught my attention.  It was like cherry-haloed sunshine, floating between her neon blue hair and her black lace dress.  She emerged from a cube in the Romance section, walked up to me, leaned in close and sniffed at the air. Then she said with the hint of a Mexican accent, &#8220;I smell a transfer from Bainbridge library, no?  An MFA boy, if I&#8217;m not mistaken?&#8221;
&#8220;That obvious?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;Lucky guess.&#8221;  She laughed, and flicked my author&#8217;s license.  &#8220;Says so right here.&#8221;
&#8220;Oh.  Yes.&#8221;  I felt the fool.  I glanced at her author&#8217;s license.  &#8220;Myra Sweet.&#8221;
&#8220;That&#8217;s me,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;So, the great literary novel didn&#8217;t work out like you thought it would, eh?&#8221;
&#8220;You&#8217;ve heard of my book?&#8221;
&#8220;No, but it&#8217;s the same old story.  Follow me.  I&#8217;ll show you around.&#8221;  She turned and walked away.  I followed in the wake of her sugary perfume, and my eyes were drawn down to the swaying of her hips.  There lie danger, I felt certain, but tempting danger.
On the back of her black suede book jacket were reviews of her work.
&#8220;Myra Sweet&#8217;s recital style would make an audience in Antarctica sweat.&#8221; &#8211; Romance Recitals Monthly
&#8220;Sweet lives up to her name with The Bride Wore Pistols.  This one has to be heard to be believed.&#8221; &#8211; Jenna Johnson, Amazon-Random House
&#8220;Myra Sweet blends sex and action so seamlessly her work deserves a new genre &#8211; sextion?  Sacxy?  Whatever, she&#8217;s smoking hot.&#8221; &#8211; Phoenix Jones
I wondered if the reviews were real.  I hoped they weren&#8217;t.  If someone with reviews like that didn&#8217;t have a patron supporting her, what chance did I have?  I reached back to make sure the blurb for my own book, &#8220;Magic Daze and Dark Knights,&#8221; was still Velcroed securely to the back of my jacket.
We walked past the row of thriller authors, almost exclusively men with crew cuts dressed in various colored jumpsuits and bomber-style book jackets.  A few of them gave me an informal salute or a cursory nod as we passed, and their musk cologne made me cough in response.
We passed the row of horror authors, with their all-black clothing, red or black hair, and pale skin.  Most of them arched a single eyebrow at me, or stared at me until I looked away.
Further off I saw cowboys and cowgirls, Renaissance-garbed folks, and business-casual attire.  Seeing so many authors of the same genre together just reinforced my opinion that &#8220;dressing to genre&#8221; was not a good idea for everyone.  One man&#8217;s mustachio was another man&#8217;s weasely whiskers.  One woman&#8217;s ghostly was another woman&#8217;s sickly.  It reminded me to straighten my posture and suck in my modest gut.
At the back of the library was a &#8220;timeline of books&#8221; displayed across the wall.  We walked along it,[...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>Although I liked &lt;i&gt;Wicked&lt;/i&gt;, I didn't really care for the next two books in Gregory Maguire's "Wicked Years" series. The conclusion, &lt;i&gt;Out of Oz&lt;/i&gt;, just came out, and I figured it was worth taking a look. Perhaps I should've just learned my lesson.</description>

Pairs
by Zachary Jernigan
I had been practicing turning myself into a knife. Between star systems I gathered and focused my particles into a triangle, a sharp shape. Hurling myself against the diamond-hard walls of my small ship, the point of the weapon hardened. I honed myself.
            You see, I had decided to murder my employer. I had studied his weaknesses and come to believe myself capable of the act. I did not know when and where, nor did I know what would trigger it. I simply knew it had to happen. On that day I would either die or buy myself a measure of freedom.
            Originally, this was the extent of my plan: To serve myself.
My name is Arihant. I am one of two humans still inhabiting a physical form, diminished though it is. Outside the walls of my ship, I am in form a faintly translucent white specter, strong and powerfully built&#8212;an artist&#8217;s anatomical model. Over the years it has become difficult to remember what my face looked like, and thus my features are only approximately human, my head bare. My eyes glow the color of Earth&#8217;s sun.
            I am quite beautiful, Louca tells me. On more than one occasion she has run her hands over the ghostly contours of my body. &#8220;I wish you were solid,&#8221; she once said. &#8220;Oh, Ari. The things I would do to you.&#8221;
            Louca is the one I am forced to follow and observe. Her name means crazy&#8212;an appropriate name. She is the second human possessing a body. Technically, her body is a black, whale-shaped ship one hundred meters long, but her avatars take the forms of anything she imagines. Very rarely, she is human, and never the same person twice. More often, she wears the bodies of flying animals.
            She dreams of flying, which is appropriate.
            Our profession is transport. For three centuries we have hauled the disembodied souls of Earth&#8212;each stored in a projection cube&#8212;from star to star to be sold. They are quite expensive, I am told, but I have no understanding of the means of exchange. Nearly everything is hidden from me, and Louca sees nothing.
            The reason souls are bought varies. Often they are kept as curios. Sometimes they are used to attract customers to the buyer&#8217;s business. My employer used to goad me on these points: &#8220;Is it not wonderful to know your people are put to such good use? Imagine how happy it must make them!&#8221;
            But I know the truth. Even without physical bodies, men become lonely. They despair and I feel it. Surely Louca feels it; she goes crazier and crazier in such close proximity to ghosts. Before the events of this story, only the luckiest souls were bought in pairs or groups, a rare occurrence. Now, because of Louca and I, it is the rule that souls must be sold in pairs.
            It is my one accomplishment, making men marginally less alone.
            Still, I arrange nothing&#8212;I have no power over the situation. I follow Louca from a distance of one hundred thousand kilometers, never any closer, and report anything unusual. I need not watch very closely. Louca&#8217;s duty is to dream violent dreams, to defend and deliver her payload. Hopefully, her capacity for violence will never be tested. She is categorically insane&#8212;a fact that, my employer insists, makes her uniquely suited to the job of protector.
            Employer. Job. The terms are ridiculous, for Louca and I are not paid. Our terms of service are not negotiable. I am no one&#8217;s employee, but I prefer not to use the word slave. Or master.
            I cling to life. I value it, though what value it has is measured in a mere handful of molecules. I possess no unique or useful knowledge, only memories. My ship, small though it is, has several lifetimes&#8217; worth of entertainment files. [...]</ns2:summary>

Hello everyone,
Can we talk about Fringe for a second? It&#8217;s somehow managed to survive to a fourth season on Fox, which is a feat in and of itself. But it&#8217;s also managed to keep the monsters of the week new and interesting, even when they&#8217;re new iterations of the same monsters of the week because we&#8217;re now in a slightly more adjacent parallel universe than the one we&#8217;d gotten used to. And when the new monsters are the old good guys.
It&#8217;s also notable for surviving because we&#8217;re kind of awash in fantasy on the (American) teevee right now. Grimm, Being Human, and Once Upon a Time are the new-ish &#8216;genre&#8217; shows, and SyFy, which some of you elderly folks may remember as the SciFi channel, doesn&#8217;t have a science fiction series that isn&#8217;t imminently headed for the grave.
Which is kind of a show of how fickle the fates of TV production is, and how swiftly the tide can shift away once a new shiny happy fun ball enters the room.
But Fringe continues to turn in the solid mediations on the endless strange that lurks in the corners of space-time, while keeping you caring about characters even as many of them permutate as the show moves from universe to universe.
This month we bring you a trio of stories from Judith Tarr, Randy Henderson, and Zachary Jernigan. They contain dinosaurs, a future of literature or at least novels, and the souls of Earth &#8212; in a convenient travel cube.

The Ghost of a Girl Who Never Lived
By Keffy R. M. Kehrli
I am Sara&#8217;s second body.
My first memory is of Sara&#8217;s resurrection in a room that smelled of cotton balls and hydrogen peroxide.
&#8220;That&#8217;s funny,&#8221; a man said.
The world felt raw, sore, and new. Under my back, my butt, my fingertips, I could feel every thread in the sheets beneath me. The blanket over my stomach scratched. Padded straps crossed my arms.
&#8220;What&#8217;s funny?&#8221; This voice was a woman&#8217;s.
&#8220;Got another error message,&#8221; the man answered. &#8220;Have you ever seen that one before?&#8221;
I felt the sheets with Sara&#8217;s fingers, and the texture conjured memories I didn&#8217;t have. I should have known where I was and what I was there for, but I couldn&#8217;t catch hold of the fleeting thoughts. In the dim light of the room I could only see the ceiling.
&#8220;Let me see.&#8221; I heard a frenzied clicking. &#8220;It failed twice?&#8221;
&#8220;Nothing copied the first time, so I started over. It got about halfway through, and then it gave me this.&#8221;
&#8220;Error two-one-five-two. Copy error,&#8221; the woman said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen that before. I&#8217;ve never even seen an error in the middle of a transplant. Did you check the manual?&#8221;
&#8220;It didn&#8217;t list this one.&#8221;
The woman sighed and said, &#8220;The only thing I can think of is if we wipe everything back out and start over.&#8221;
 Operating tables, and the anesthetician&#8217;s face. Tissue paper examining tables, candles in a church.
&#8220;She&#8217;s conscious, though,&#8221; the man said. &#8220;When the machine aborted, it sent the Copy Completed code. Don&#8217;t look at me like that! I don&#8217;t know if I ought to mess around with it anymore, or&#8230;&#8221;
The woman interrupted, &#8220;You know we can&#8217;t do that without contacting the parents. Come on, we might as well go see what the damage is.&#8221;
They stood over me. The man was the younger of the two, and he looked down at me from behind thick glasses. He held his clipboard tight against his chest like a shield. The woman stood closer to me; her hair was light, either blond or grey. She frowned like it was my fault.
&#8220;Can you hear and understand me?&#8221; she asked.
The man wrote something on his clipboard. I could hear graphite rubbed free, caught in the paper.
My mouth felt dry, and my lips did too, as though if I tried to speak they would break apart. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; I managed.
She unhooked the straps on my arms. I lifted my left arm and looked at the fingers, hand, wrist. Clean, and smooth, unmarked.
Cat-scratch scar near my first knuckle, angry red and faded pink.
&#8220;Do you know why you&#8217;re here?&#8221;
I wanted to say the right thing, but I didn&#8217;t know what that would be. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t.&#8221;
&#8220;She&#8217;s coherent,&#8221; the woman said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to call the parents.&#8221;
The man nodded, and he was still writing. Scratch scratch scratch. He didn&#8217;t answer her.
The woman disconnected something that slid out from under the skin of my scalp, and I didn&#8217;t like how it rubbed against my skull. &#8220;Make sure you tell them that we won&#8217;t require the final payment until we get this sorted.&#8221;
&#8220;Copy error,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Is that why I don&#8217;t know where we are?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, Sara,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think.&#8221;
#
I walk until I find a cabin in the woods, the windows broken out by tree branches, by wind and rain and thrown rocks. The door hangs far on its hinges.
Shotgun shells, wet with rain. Raccoon droppings. These are the things that litter the floor inside. I step over them in Sara&#8217;s boots, into a [...]</ns2:summary>

Devour
By Ferrett Steinmetz
&#8220;I want some water,&#8221; Sergio says. &#160;The bicycle chains clank as he strains to
put his feet on the floor.
Sergio designed his own restraints. &#160;He had at least fifteen plumbers on his
payroll who could have installed the chains &#8211; but Sergio&#8217;s never trusted
anything he didn&#8217;t build with his own hands. &#160;So he deep-drilled gear mounts
into our guest room&#8217;s floral wallpaper, leaving me to string greased roller
chains through the cast-iron curlicues of the canopy bed.
&#8220;You&#8217;re doing well, Bruce,&#8221; he lied, trying to smile &#8211; but his lips were
already desiccated, pulled too tight at the edges. &#160;Not his lips at all.
I slowed him down; I had soft lawyer&#8217;s hands, more used to keyboards than
Allen wrenches. &#160;Yet we both knew it would be the last time we could touch
each other. &#160;So I asked for help I didn&#8217;t need, and he took my hands in his
to guide the chains through what he referred to as &#8220;the marionette mounts.&#8221;

Then he sat on the bed and held out his wrists while I snapped the manacles
on &#8211; the chamois lining was my idea &#8211; and we kissed. &#160;It was a long, slow
kiss that needed to summarize thirty-two years of marriage. And it should
have been comforting, but his mouth was a betrayal. &#160;His lips had resorbed
from their lush plumpness. &#160;His tongue had withdrawn to a stub.
His kiss still sent flutters down my spine.
I pressed my hands against his back, moving towards making love, but Sergio
pushed me away. &#160;&#8221;We don&#8217;t know how transmissible this is,&#8221; he said. &#160;Then
he tugged on the chains to verify he could lie down and sit up, but not
leave the bed.
I pressed the keys into his palm, trying to burn the feeling of his skin
into mine forever. &#160;He snipped the keys in half with a bolt-cutter, then
flung it all into the corner.
&#8220;That&#8217;s that,&#8221; he said, and rolled away from me to cry. &#160;My arms ached -
still ache &#8211; from not being able to hold him.
Six days later, I&#8217;m still here. &#160;And Sergio is still leaving.
&#8220;I want some water,&#8221; he repeats now. &#160;Louder, more insistent. &#160;Too angry to
be really Sergio.
&#8220;You never wanted water before,&#8221; I say, keeping a careful distance from the
bed. &#160;&#8221;You like orange juice.&#8221;
Sergio tries to put his head in his hands. &#160;The chains pull him short.
&#8220;For Christ&#8217;s sake, Bruce,&#8221; he says. &#160;&#8221;I&#8217;m dying. &#160;There are going to be
changes.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I say guardedly. &#160;&#8221;There are.&#8221;
&#8220;And it&#8217;s apple cider I like. &#160;In a chilled glass. &#160;From the local guao yan,
no, orchard &#8211; and not that sugared crap you like. &#160;Don&#8217;t try to trick me,
okay? &#160;It&#8217;s just insulting to.&#8221;
He almost says to us, but then shudders.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to do anything crazy with water,&#8221; he begs. &#160;&#8221;I can&#8217;t turn it
into. what&#8217;s the word? &#160;Flamethrowers. &#160;It&#8217;s water. &#160;I&#8217;m just. thirsty.
I&#8217;ll fight with you about the things that matter, but.
&#8220;Just get me some damn water!&#8221; he barks. &#160;I stare at him, knowing the old
Sergio never yelled, wondering how much is left.
Because I can see the traces of a young Sergio within the thing trapped in
the four-poster right now. &#160;Sergio always had that perfect, youthful mix of
good cheekbones and lean muscle. &#160;Now, his thighs and biceps are swollen
like a hormone-stuffed steer &#8211; but aside from that, Sergio would be the envy
of any plastic surgeon. &#160;His crow&#8217;s feet have been pulled from his skin, his
collagen replenished. &#160;His hair, once a brilliant mane of salt-and-pepper
curls, has turned a lank black at the roots. &#160;It looks like some horrid[...]</ns2:summary>

They&#8217;re waiting for him when he comes out of the tank.&#160; Whether plainclothes or just another pair of clockers, he can&#8217;t quite tell, but the way they avoid looking in his direction tips him off in a heartbeat.&#160; When Ari Marvel walks by, you _look_.
They start drifting idly in his direction, and that clinches things.&#160; Reaching down into the lining of his pocket, Ari palms the whole batch and trails his hand over the edge of the bridge railing.&#160; The brittle grey modsticks crumble with ease, and by the time the two have dropped their cover and made the sting he&#8217;s moved smoothly into position, hands against the brick and legs spread wide.&#160; The pigs don&#8217;t even thank him for being so efficient.&#160; The patdown&#8217;s rougher than necessary, but after a minute they throw their hoods back up and move off down the street.
Ari runs his hands through his faded blue-green spikes, then takes the stairs down to the tube.&#160; A beginner might have lingered at the railing and thought about all the time and money now floating down the culvert, but Ari doesn&#8217;t look back.&#160; Necessary expenditures.&#160; Expected losses.
It&#8217;s just business, baby.
#
Back at the pad, Maggie&#8217;s waiting by the door.&#160; She looks like hell: hair in ratty dreads, shirt stained with god-knows-what.&#160; Crust in her eyes.
&#8220;Hey, Ari,&#8221; she says.
Ari slides his keycard into the lock, checking first to see if the hair he put over the swipestripe has been moved.&#160; Still there.&#160; It doesn&#8217;t mean that nobody&#8217;s been there, of course&#8211;just that if they have been, they&#8217;re good enough that there&#8217;s no point in worrying about it.&#160; You win some, you lose some.
Inside, it looks like he&#8217;s won.&#160; Maggie plops down on the couch, worrying a hangnail that&#8217;s started to bleed.&#160; Her foot taps on the coffee table.
&#8220;Hey,&#8221; she says again.&#160; He drops his coat onto the chair and moves into the kitchen to get a soda.&#160; She picks up the remote and begins flipping rapidly through the channels, then turns the set off again.&#160; Eventually he leaves the can on the counter and comes back into the living room, sitting down on the coffee table across from her and taking her hands.
&#8220;Maggie, look at me.&#8221; She does&#8211;or, at least, as well as she&#8217;s able to at this point.
&#8220;I&#8217;m only going to say this once.&#160; You&#8217;re welcome to crash here, but you&#8217;re not getting a fix.&#160; I won&#8217;t have that in my house.&#160; You understand?&#8221;
She nods&#8211;those wide doe eyes the color of egg yolk&#8211;then goes back to gnawing at her thumb.&#160; He stands and leaves her there, entering the bedroom and closing the door.&#160; Once it&#8217;s locked, he jimmies loose the bottom drawer of the dresser and flips a wad of sweaty bills into the crudely carved hollow.&#160; Then he drops fully clothed onto the mattress and covers his eyes with his forearm, blocking out the ruddy afternoon light that still filters in through heavy curtains. Out in the apartment, he can hear her moving about restlessly.
He&#8217;s doing it again.&#160; It doesn&#8217;t matter that he knows how it&#8217;ll end, that he knows how it _has_ ended more than once.&#160; It&#8217;s simply a given: she&#8217;ll show up.&#160; He&#8217;ll let her in.&#160; Things will proceed accordingly.&#160; He bears down with his arm until the muted red of his eyelids turns to black, and then to stars.
The worst of it is that even through the filth, he can still see her.&#160; Inside the shell of those dreads, her hair is still gold verging on white, so fine as to be almost intangible.&#160; Behind the bruises and bags, her eyes would still crinkle upward if she smiled.&#160; And if he opened his arms, she might still flow into them like water, sparkling and warm and full of life.
Ari is not a stupid man, but Maggie is an exception.
Eyes clenched tight, Ari curls up on his side and falls asleep.

&#8220;You don&#8217;t look like an omnivore.&#8221;
I was supposed to spend the next several years working side-by-side
with this bear monster thing from an unpronounceable planet, and the
first words she speaks to me are these.
&#8220;Excuse me?&#8221;
&#8220;Your teeth are flat,&#8221; she hissed.  &#8220;Like a herbivore&#8217;s.&#8221;
I had been waiting in the tiered square outside the Hall of Harmony,
main office of the Galactic police force officially called the
Harmonizers, but which everyone really called the Predators.
Neelee-ornor is one of those planets that makes me a believer.  Cities
crowd right into forests as thick as the Amazon, and both somehow thrive
with riotous abandon.  It proves the Galactic creed really means
something.  Something worth fighting for.  Something that could get me
to take this thankless job.
So I waited to meet my partner, as I sat on a cool stone bench under a
huge branch dripping green saprophytes.  The air was damp but smelled,
strangely, like California after the rain, when I would leave CalTech
and hike into the hills.  I almost didn&#8217;t want her to show, so I could
sit and enjoy it.
I really knew only three things about her.  She had about two e-years
under her belt as a Predator.  She was a Sussuratian, a race of fierce
bearlike carnivores evolved from predatory pack animals, only a century
ahead of humanity in entering Galactic Culture.  And she was named
Briaathursiasaliantiormethessess.
God help me.
I rose awkwardly every time a Sussuratian passed, only to sit again
after it walked on.  Finally I gave up, and then a moment later a
Sussuratian bounded out of the passing crowds, and addressed me with
this comment about my eating habits.
I sprung off the bench and bowed slightly.  &#8220;I am Tarkos.&#8221;  We were
talking Galactic.  But my Galactic is pretty good, really.  Better than
hers, I was betting.  Her name, however, was a Sussuratian name, and in
that language a human larynx was hopeless.  Well, here goes.  &#8220;I am
honored to meet you Briaathursiasaliantiormethessess.&#8221;
She was about six feet long, with short dark fur that had black and
green and gold patterns in it reminiscent of a boa.  She was a
quadraped, and walked on all fours, her claws clicking.  Now she sat
back on her haunches and put her front hands together, threading the
seven claws on one hand through the seven on the other.  The effect was
a Kodiak holding a bouquet of knives.  Her four eyes &#8212; two large green
ones set below two small black ones &#8212; fixed on me.
&#8220;I am called Briaathursiasaliantiormethessess,&#8221; she said.
I bowed slightly again.  &#8220;Yes.  I apologize for my pronunciation.&#8221;  I
took a deep breath and tried again.  &#8220;Briaathursiasaliantiormethessess.&#8221;
&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, speaking now very slowly.  &#8220;It&#8217;s
Briaathursiasaliantiormethessess.&#8221;
For the life of me her pronunciation sounded exactly like mine.  Except
with a bunch of hissing involved in all the S&#8217;s.  &#8220;Can I just call you
Bria?&#8221;
Her small black eyes closed.  I knew that expressed something &#8211;
impatience?  Disgust?  Chagrin?  I couldn&#8217;t remember.  It&#8217;s hard to
learn emotional expressions from a crash video course.
&#8220;This assignment is of great importance and could be perilous,&#8221; she
said.  &#8220;I told them I didn&#8217;t want to work with a human.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, thanks for your honesty.&#8221;
She ran her long, dark-red tongue over fangs longer than my fingers.
Maybe she understood human sarcasm, because this 300-kilo carnivore then
offered an explanation:  &#8220;You&#8217;re dangerous.  I fear you.&#8221;
I nodded.  &#8220;Yeah.  I hear that a lot.&#8221;

The Eckener Alternative
by James L. Cambias
The Hindenburg swung gently on the mast at Lakehurst as the sky over New  Jersey turned to purple twilight.&#160; All the passengers, the reporters,  the newsreel men were gone.&#160; A couple of sailors stood guard beneath the  big ship to enforce the no-smoking rule.
John Cavalli waited until the watchman below had turned away,  then slid down the stern rope to the ground.&#160; He hunkered down next to  the big rolling anchor weight for a couple of minutes, then hurried off  into the darkness beyond the floodlights.
Once he was clear, Cavalli stopped to peel off the Russian army  arctic commando suit he&#8217;d been wearing ever since the Zeppelin had  lifted off from Frankfurt-am-Main.&#160; It had kept him warm as he hid among  the gas cells with his IR goggles and fire extinguisher, but now in the  warmth of a spring evening it was stifling.
He hit the RETURN button on his wristband and disappeared.
#
&#8220;You can&#8217;t make big changes,&#8221; said the instructor the first day of Temporal Studies class.&#160; He was a very laid-back physicist recruited from California in 2020s.&#160; &#8220;That&#8217;s the most important rule.&#160; The folks we  work for are the result of a particular set of historical events.&#160;Change history too much and their probability level drops below 50  percent.&#160; If that happens, all this&#8221; &#8212; his gesture encompassed the Time  Center &#8212; goes away and we&#8217;re out of a job.&#160; If we even exist anymore.&#8221;
A student in the row ahead of Cavalli raised his hand.&#160; &#8220;What about making little changes?&#8221;
&#8220;Little  changes are fine.&#160; We make little changes all the time.&#160; Most of them  are things like making long-term investments, buying up art treasures  for safekeeping, keeping species from going extinct, that kind of  thing.&#160; You&#8217;re going to learn all about gauging the effect of changes,  avoiding heterodynes and chaotic points, and when it&#8217;s okay to step on  butterflies.&#8221;
Cavalli was listening, but in the margin of his notebook he was doodling airships.
#
The  timegate stage was dark and the control room was empty, just as he&#8217;d  left it.&#160; The Coke can was still on the console.&#160; Was it maybe a little  further to the left than he remembered?&#160; He stepped off the stage and  took a drink.&#160; Still tasted the same.&#160; It would take a pretty big  timeshift to change the flavor of Coca-Cola.
Cavalli locked the door behind him with his purloined master key  (the Time Center used mechanical locks because they were a bit more  resistant to minor time-shifts) and headed for the library.&#160; He found a  book about Zeppelins he didn&#8217;t remember and skimmed the pages.&#160; Hindenburg served safely until 1939; scrapped when WWII broke out.&#160; No  postwar Zeppelins.&#160; The usual &#8220;return of the airship&#8221; speculations.
Damn.&#160; It hadn&#8217;t worked.&#160; He had hoped erasing the vivid image  of the Hindenburg fire would have been enough to keep passenger  airships alive, but the war still marked the end of their era.
#
&#8220;So why don&#8217;t we stop things like the Holocaust or the firebombing of  Dresden?&#8221;&#160; It was a relatively quiet dorm room party with half a dozen  trainees blowing off steam after the first written exam.&#160; Cavalli didn&#8217;t  see who asked the question, but he sounded drunk.
Anna Kyle, the third-year trainee, answered. &#8220;Too big.&#160; The  models predict major shifts in the 21st Century if there&#8217;s no  Holocaust.&#160; You lose the Cold War and the whole Jihad era.&#160; We just stay  away from World War II if we can help it.&#160; Rescue a few things from  museums before they get flattened, take some videos for historians,  that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
&#8220;Why not stop the whole war?[...]</ns2:summary>

The Water Man
by Ursula Pflug
The water man came today. I waited all morning, and then all afternoon, painting plastic soldiers to pass the time. Red paint too in the sky when he finally showed; I turned the outside lights on for him and held the door while he carried the big bottles in. He set them all in a row just inside the storm door; there wasn&#8217;t any other place to put them. When he was done he stood catching his breath, stamping his big boots to warm his feet. Melting snow made little muddy lakes on the linoleum. I dug in my jeans for money to tip him with, knowing I wouldn&#8217;t find any. Finally I just offered him water. 
We drank together. It was cool and clean and good, running down our throats in the dimness of the store. It made me feel wide and quiet, and I watched his big eyes poke around Synapses, checking us out, and while they did, mine snuck a peek at him. He was big and round, and all his layers of puffy clothes made him seem rounder still, like a black version of the Michelin man. He unzipped his parka and I could see a name, Gary, stitched in red over the pocket of his blue coverall. I still didn&#8217;t have a light on; usually I work in the dark, save the light bill for Deb. But I switched it on when he coughed and he smiled at that, like we&#8217;d shared a joke. He had a way of not looking right at you or saying much, but somehow you still knew what he was thinking. Like I knew that he liked secrets, and talking without making sounds. It was neat.
Seemed to me it was looking water&#8211;a weird thought out of nowhere&#8211;unless it came from him. He seemed to generate them; like he could stand in the middle of a room and in everyone&#8217;s minds, all around him, weird little thoughts would start cropping up&#8211;like that one. My tummy sloshing I looked too, and seemed to see through his eyes and not just mine. Through his I wasn&#8217;t sure how to take it: a big dim room haunted by dinosaurs. All the junk of this century comes to rest at Synapses; it gets piled to the ceilings and covered with dust. If it&#8217;s lucky it makes a Head; weird Heads are going to be the thing for Carnival this year, just as they were last, and Debbie&#8217;s are the best. Her finished products are grotesque, but if you call that beautiful then they are; the one she just finished dangles phone cords like Medusa&#8217;s hair, gears like jangling medals. Shelves of visors glint under the ceiling fixture; inlaid with chips and broken bits of circuitry, they hum like artifacts from some Byzantium that isn&#8217;t yet. Two faced Janus masks, their round doll eyes removed; you can wear them either way, male or female, to look in or out.
Gary was staring at them, a strange expression on his face. Like he wanted to throw up.
&#8220;Do you think they&#8217;re good?&#8221; I asked, to stop him looking like that. 
&#8220;Good enough,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you like dinosaurs.&#8221;
&#8220;I like them. They are strange and wonderful.&#8221;
&#8220;But dinosaurs all the[...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli present "The Secret World of Arrietty", a film for kids that I found surprisingly average, given its pedigree. Still, if you have young children, they'll enjoy it.</description>

		<description>The fashions may not hold up; the slang and pop-culture references might be dated; the effects in the early seasons are definitely iffy. But the storytelling will make &lt;i&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/i&gt; worth watching even twenty, thirty, or fifty years later.</description>

		<description>The gold standard for musical episodes is Joss Whedon's "Once More, With Feeling", a sixth-season episode of &lt;i&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/i&gt;. The soundtrack to it was released the same year as the episode (2002). But how does that soundtrack hold up if you're not watching the episode at the same time?</description>

The Speed of Time
by Jay Lake
&#8220;Light goes by at the speed of time,&#8221; Marlys once told me.
That was a joke, of course. Light can be slowed to a standstill in a photon trap, travel on going nowhere at all forever in the blueing distance of an event horizon, or blaze through hard vacuum as fast as information itself moves through the universe. Time is relentless, the tide which measures the perturbations of the cosmos. The 160.2 GHz hum of creation counts the measure of our lives as surely as any heartbeat.
There is no t in e=mc2.
I&#8217;d argued with her then, missing her point back when understanding her might have mattered. Now, well, nothing much at all mattered. Time has caught up with us all.
#
Let me tell you a story about Sameera Glasshouse.
She&#8217;d been an ordinary woman living an ordinary life. Habitat chemistry tech, certifications from several middle-tier authorities, bouncing from contract to contract in trans-Belt space. Ten thousand women, men and inters just like her out there during the Last Boom. We didn&#8217;t call it that then, no one knew the expansion curve the solar economy had been riding was the last of anything. The Last Boom didn&#8217;t really have a name when it was underway, except maybe to economists.
Sameera had been pair-bonded to a Jewish kid from Zion Luna, and kept the surname long after she&#8217;d dropped Roz from her life. For one thing, &#8220;Glasshouse&#8221; scandalized her Lebanese grandmother, which was a reward in itself.
She was working a double ticket on the Enceladus Project master depot, in low orbit around that particular iceball. That meant pulling shift-on-shift week after week, but Sameera got an expanded housing allocation and a fatter pay packet for her trouble. The E.P. got to schlep one less body to push green inside their habitat scrubbers. Everybody won.
Her spare time was spent wiring together Big Ears, to listen for the chatter that flooded bandwidth all over the solar system. Human beings are &#8212; were &#8212; noisy. Launch control, wayfinding, birthday greetings, telemetry, banking queries, loneliness, porn. It was all out there, multiplied and ramified beyond comprehension by the combination of lightspeed lag, language barriers and sheer, overwhelming complexity.
Some folks back then claimed there were emergent structures in the bandwidth, properties of the sum of all that chatter which could not be accounted for by analysis of the components. This sort of thinking had been going around since the dawn of information theory &#8212; call it information fantasy. The same hardwired pareidolia that made human beings see the hand of God in the empirical universe also made us hear Him in the electronic shrieking of our tribe.
Sameera never really believed any of it, but she&#8217;d heard some very weird things listening in. In space, it was always midnight, and ghosts never stopped playing in the bandwidth. When she&#8217;d picked up a crying child on a leaky sideband squirt out of a nominally empty vector, she&#8217;d just kept hopping frequencies. When she&#8217;d tuned on the irregular regularity of a coded data feed that seemed to originate from deep within Saturn&#8217;s atmosphere, she&#8217;d just kept hopping frequencies.
But one day God had called Sameera by name. Her voice crackled out of the rising fountain of energy from an extragalactic gamma ray burst, whispering the three syllables over and over and over in a voice which resonated down inside the soft tissues of Sameera&#8217;s body, made her joints ache, jellied the very resolve of the soul that she had not known she possessed until that exact moment.
Sameera Glasshouse shut down her Big Ears, wiped the logic blocks, dumped the memory, then made her way down to the master depot&#8217;s tiny sacramentarium.

		<description>You may have heard of the &lt;i&gt;Wizard of Oz&lt;/i&gt; sequel &lt;i&gt;Return to Oz&lt;/i&gt;, but despite its cult following, not that many people have seen it. Still, if you can get your hands on it, it's a decent film with exceedingly-creepy imagery and a couple of worthy villains.</description>

Counting Cracks
By George R. Galuschak
Four of us, jammed into my sister&#8217;s Ford Festiva, going to kill the monster. Sylvia drives. The Hum has left her untouched, so she&#8217;s the only one left in town who can drive. My sister licks the palm of her hand, touches it to her nose and bumps her forehead against the steering wheel. Then she does it again.
&#8220;Today would be nice, sis.&#8221; I say. I&#8217;m in the back seat with June, a twelve-year old girl clutching a teddy bear to her chest.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going as fast as I can,&#8221; she tells me. &#8220;It&#8217;s bad today.&#8221;
&#8220;The Shop-Rite has three hundred and fifty-seven ceiling tiles,&#8221; Michael tells me. He&#8217;s a little kid, nine years old, sitting up front with Sylvia. &#8220;I counted them.&#8221;
&#8220;Inpatient oranges creep handsome banisters,&#8221; June says, rolling her eyes.
&#8220;Good for you,&#8221; I say. My left leg hurts, which I guess is a good sign. My left arm feels like dead weight except for the tips of my fingers, which are tingly.
&#8220;Do you count tiles, Mr. Bruschi?&#8221; Michael asks.
&#8220;No. I counted cracks on the sidewalk. When I was a kid.&#8221;
A sparrow collides with the windshield. It bounces off and skitters to the pavement, where it thrashes. I haven&#8217;t seen a living bird in days. It must have flown into the Hum.
&#8220;Swill,&#8221; June says, pointing at the bird. &#8220;Maraschino cherries. Skittles. Cocktail weenies.&#8221;
&#8220;All right. I&#8217;m ready.&#8221; Sylvia twists the key, and the car starts. We back out of the driveway.
&#8220;The streets are so empty,&#8221; she says.
&#8220;That&#8217;s because everyone is dead,&#8221; Michael tells her. &#8220;They listened to the Hum and went into their houses and pulled the covers over their heads and died. I had a hamster that died, once. It got real old, so it made a little nest, and then it laid down in it and died.&#8221;
&#8220;We&#8217;re not dead,&#8221; I say.
&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; Michael corrects me. &#8220;Give it time.&#8221;
#
It started a week ago. Tuesday morning, hot day, storm clouds gathering like bad thoughts. I walked out to my car. I was going to work, the way normal people do. I&#8217;m not normal, but I&#8217;ve gotten good at pretending.
I saw a robin fluttering its wings on the sidewalk. At first I thought its back was broken, but when I came closer it squawked and ran onto the lawn. It gave a little hop, flapping its wings, and then hopped again.
I put my hands to my temples. My head hurt. I hadn&#8217;t slept well the night before, and I could feel the beginnings of a migraine forming. I looked at the robin, hopping and flapping its wings on my lawn. It didn&#8217;t look injured; it looked like it had forgotten how to fly.
I shrugged and walked away. The bird&#8217;s behavior was strange, but I needed to get to work. So I went. When I drove home that evening the sidewalks and streets were covered with birds, all squawking and flapping their wings.
The bird story made the nightly news. The newswoman stood in Buehler Park surrounded by a flock of distressed pigeons. She talked too loud and stumbled over her words. Her voice sounded a bit slurred, like she was drunk.
&#8220;Put something else on,&#8221; my wife said. We were eating dinner in front of the TV, the way we did when things were good between us.
&#8220;All right.&#8221; I shrugged and switched the channel. We watched a movie, and I forgot all about the birds.
The next morning my wife went blind.
#
We pull into Shop-Rite&#8217;s parking lot. Normally it&#8217;s jam-packed. They average three fender-benders a week, because the designers of the lot made the lanes too small, the spaces too tight. But today we drive right in.
&#8220;This is far enough[...]</ns2:summary>

 The girl was perfect. Her framing, the engine at her core, the intricate web of connections holding her objects together, built-in redundancies&#8230; Meroe had never seen such efficiency. The girl&#8217;s structure was simple because she didn&#8217;t need any of the shortcuts and workarounds that most of their kind required to function. There was no bloat to her, no junk code slowing her down, no patchy sores that left her vulnerable to infection.
&#8220;She&#8217;s a thing of beauty, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221; Faster said.
Meroe returned to interface view. He glanced at Zo and saw the same suspicion lurking in her beatific expression.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen anything like this,&#8221; Meroe said, watching Zo, speaking to Faster. &#8220;We don&#8217;t grow that way.&#8221;
&#8220;I know!&#8221; Faster was pacing, gesticulating, caught up in his own excitement. He didn&#8217;t notice Meroe&#8217;s look. &#8220;She must have evolved from something professionally-coded. Maybe even Government Standard. I didn&#8217;t think we could be born from that!&#8221;
They couldn&#8217;t. Meroe stared at the girl, not liking what he was seeing. The avatar was just too well-designed, too detailed. Her features and coloring matched that of some variety of Latina; probably Central or South American given the noticeable indigenous traits. Most of their kind created Caucasian avatars to start &#8212; a human minority who for some reason comprised the majority of images available for sampling in the Amorph. And most first avatars had bland, nondescript faces. This girl had clear features, right down to her distinctively-formed lips and chin &#8212; and hands. It had taken five versionings for Meroe to get his own hands right.
&#8220;Did you check out her feature-objects?&#8221; Faster asked, oblivious to Meroe&#8217;s unease.
&#8220;Why?&#8221;
Zo answered. &#8220;Two of them are standard add-ons &#8212; an aggressive defender and a diagnostic tool. The other two we can&#8217;t identify. Something new.&#8221; Her lips curved in a smile; she knew how he would react.

		<description>With the end of Harry Potter and the impending end of Twilight, studios were looking for the next big book-to-movie hit. They found it with &lt;i&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/i&gt;. But did the movie live up to the book, or even its own hype?</description>

&#8220;Run,&#8221; Bakri Says
By Ferrett Steinmetz
&#8220;I just want to know where my brother is,&#8221; Irena yells at the guards.  The
English words are thick and slow on her tongue, like honey.  She holds her
hands high in the air; the gun she&#8217;s tucked into the back of her pants jabs
at her spine.
She doesn&#8217;t want to kill the soldiers on this iteration; she&#8217;s never killed
anyone before, and doesn&#8217;t want to start.  But unless she can get poor, weak
Sammi out of that prison in the next fifty/infinity minutes, they&#8217;ll start
in on him with the rubber hoses and he&#8217;ll tell them what he&#8217;s done.  And
though she loves her brother with all her heart, it would be a blessing then
if the Americans beat him to death.
The guards are still at the far end of the street, just before the tangle of
barbed wire that bars the prison entrance.  Irena stands still, lets them
approach her, guns out.  One is a black man, the skin around his eyes
creased with a habitual expression of distrust; a fringe of white hair and
an unwavering aim marks him as a career man.  The other is a younger man,
squinting nervously, his babyfat face the picture of every new American
soldier.  Above them, a third soldier looks down from his wooden tower,
reaching for the radio at his belt.
She hopes she won&#8217;t get to know them.  This will be easier if all they do is
point guns and yell.  It&#8217;ll be just like Sammi&#8217;s stupid videogames.
&#8220;My brother,&#8221; she repeats, her mouth dry; it hurts to raise her arms after
the rough surgery Bakri&#8217;s done with an X-acto knife and some fishing line.
&#8220;His name is Sammi Daraghmeh.  You rounded him up last night, with many
other men.  He is &#8211; &#8221;
Their gazes catch on the rough iron manacle dangling from her left wrist.
She looks up, remembers that Bakri installed a button on the tether so she
could rewind, realizes the front of her cornflower-blue abayah is splotched
with blood from her oozing stitches.
&#8220;Wait.&#8221; She backs away.  &#8220;I&#8217;m not &#8211; &#8221;
The younger soldier yells, &#8220;She&#8217;s got something!&#8221;  They open fire.
Something tugs at her neck, parting flesh; another crack, and she swallows
her own teeth.  She tries to talk but her windpipe whistles; her body
betrays her, refusing to move as she crumples to the ground, willing herself
to keep going.  Nothing listens.
This is death, she thinks.  This is what it&#8217;s like to die.
#
&#8220;Run,&#8221; Bakri says, and Irena is standing in an alleyway instead of dying on
the street &#8211; gravity&#8217;s all wrong and her muscles follow her orders again.
Her arms and legs flail and she topples face-first into a pile of rotting
lettuce.  The gun Bakri has just pressed into her hands falls to the ground.
Dying was worse than she&#8217;d thought.  Her mind&#8217;s still jangled with the
shock, from feeling all her nerves shrieking in panic as she died. She
shudders in the garbage, trying to regain strength.
Bakri picks her up.  &#8220;What is your goal?&#8221; he barks, keeping his voice low so
the shoppers at the other end of the grocery store&#8217;s alleyway don&#8217;t hear.
Why is he asking me that? she thinks, then remembers: all the others went
insane.  She wouldn&#8217;t even be here if Farhouz hadn&#8217;t slaughtered seventeen
soldiers inside the Green Zone.
It takes an effort to speak.  &#8220;To &#8211; to rescue Sammi.&#8221;
&#8220;Good.&#8221; The tension drains from his face.  He looks so relieved that Irena
thinks he might burst into tears.  &#8220;What iteration?  You did iterate,
right?&#8221;
&#8220;Two,&#8221; she says numbly, understanding what his relief means: he didn&#8217;t know.
He&#8217;d sent her off to be shot, unsure whether he[...]</ns2:summary>

Golubash (Wine-Blood-War-Story)
by Catherynne M. Valente
The difficulties of transporting wine over interstellar distances are manifold. Wine is, after all, like a child. It can _bruise_. It can suffer trauma&#8212;sometimes the poor creature can recover, sometimes it must be locked up in a cellar until it learns to behave itself. Sometimes it is irredeemable. I ask that you greet the seven glasses before you tonight not as simple fermented grapes, but as the living creatures they are, well-brought up, indulged but not coddled, punished when necessary, shyly seeking your approval with clasped hands and slicked hair. After all, they have come so very far for the chance to be loved.
Welcome to the first public tasting of Domaine Zhaba. My name is Phylloxera Nanut, and it is the fruit of my family&#8217;s vines that sits before you. Please forgive our humble venue&#8212;surely we could have wished for something grander than a scorched pre-war orbital platform, but circumstances, and the constant surveillance of Chat&#234;au Marubouzu-Debrouillard and their soldiers have driven us to extremity. Mind the loose electrical panels and pull up a reactor husk&#8212;they are inert, I assure you. Spit onto the floor&#8212;a few new stains will never be noticed. As every drop about to pass your lips is wholly, thoroughly, enthusiastically illegal, we shall not stand on ceremony. Shall we begin?
2583 Sud-Cot&#234;-du-Golubash (New Danube)
The colonial ship _Quintessence of Dust_ first blazed across the skies of Avalokitesvara two hundred years before I was born, under the red stare of Barnard&#8217;s Star, our second solar benefactor. Her plasma sails streamed kilometers long, like sheltering wings. Simone Nanut was on that ship. She, alongside a thousand others, looked down on their new home from&#160; that great height, the single long, unfathomably wide river that circumscribed the globe, the golden mountains prickled with cobalt alders, the deserts streaked with pink salt.
How I remember the southern coast of Golubash, I played there, and dreamed there was a girl on the invisible opposite shore, and that her family, too, made wine and cowered like us in the shadow of the Asociaci&#243;n.
My friends, in your university days did you not study the rolls of the first colonials, did you not memorize their weight-limited cargo, verse after verse of spinning wheels, bamboo seeds, lathes, vials of tailored bacteria, as holy writ? Then perhaps you will recall Simone Nanut and her folly, that her pitiful allotment of cargo was taken up by the clothes on her back and a tangle of ancient Maribor grapevine, its roots tenderly wrapped and watered. Mad Slovak witch they all thought her, patting those tortured, battered vines into the gritty yellow soil of the Golubash basin. Even the Hyphens were sure the poor things would fail. There were only four of them on all of Avalokitesvara, immensely tall, their watery triune faces catching the old red light of Barnard&#8217;s flares, their innumerable arms fanned out around their terribly thin torsos like peacock&#8217;s tails. Not for nothing was the planet named for a Hindu god with eleven faces and a thousand arms. The colonists called them Hyphens for their way of talking, and for the thinness of their bodies. They did not understand then what you must all know now, rolling your eyes behind your sleeves as your hostess relates ancient history, that each of the four Hyphens was a quarter of the world in a single body, that they were a mere outcropping of the vast intelligences which made up the ecology of Avalokitesvara, like one of our thumbs or a pair of lips.
Golubash I knew. To know more than one Hyphen in a lifetime is rare. Officially, the great river is still called the New Danube, but eventually my[...]</ns2:summary>

Aphrodisia
By Lavie Tidhar

It began, in a way, with the midget hunchback tuk-tuk driver.

It was a night in the cool season&#8230;

The stars shone like cold hard semi-precious stones overhead. Shadows moved across the face of the moon. The beer place was emptying &#8211;

Ban Watnak where fat mosquitoes buzzed, lazily, across neon-lit faces. Thai pop playing too loudly, cigarette smoke rising the remnants of ghosts, straining to escape Earth&#8217;s atmosphere.

In the sky flying lanterns looked like tracer bullets, like fireflies. The midget hunchback tuk-tuk driver said, &#8216;Where are you going -?&#8217; mainlining street speed and ancient wisdom.

Tone: &#8216;Where are you going?&#8217;

The driver sat on the elevated throne of his vehicle and contemplated the question as if his life depended on it. &#8216;Over there,&#8217; he said, gesturing. Then, grudgingly &#8211; &#8216;Not far.&#8217;

But it was far enough for us.

Tone and Bejesus and me made three: Tone with the hafmek body, all spray-painted metal chest and arms, Victorian-style goggles hiding his eyes, a scarf in the colours of a vanished football team around his neck &#8211; it was cold. It was Earth cold, not real &#8211; there was no dial you could turn to make it go away. Bejesus not speaking, a fragile low-gravity body writhing with nervous energy despite the unaccustomed weight &#8211; Bejesus in love with this planet Earth, a long way away from his rock home in space.

Tone, in Asteroid Pidgin: &#8216;Yumi go lukaotem ol gel.&#8217;

&#8216;No girls,&#8217; I said. Tone smirked. Bejesus danced on the spot, nervous, excited, it was hard to tell. Tone said: &#8216;Boy, girl, all same.&#8217;

Bejesus, to the driver: &#8216;I dig your body work, man.&#8217;

Tone shaking his head. &#8216;Dumb ignorant rock-worm,&#8217; he said, but with affection.

The hunchback midget tuk-tuk driver grinned, said, &#8216;You come with me, no pay. Free tuk-tuk!&#8217;

&#8216;Best offer we&#8217;re going to get,&#8217; Tone said, and I nodded. Bejesus passed me a pill. I dry-swallowed. The floating lanterns seemed larger then, like warm eyes blinking high above. &#8216;Let&#8217;s go!&#8217; I said. My heart was beating too fast. &#8216;Hungry and horny and a long way from home,&#8217; Tone said &#8211; a bad poet in hafmek armour.

We went.
&#160;#

Piled at the back of a solar-powered tuk-tuk at night, Aphrodisia tunes blaring out, blurring my careful composure &#8211; Aphrodisia, the Upload Deity, queen of no-space &#8211; Aphrodisia who loved me and fucked me and sang to me and left me &#8211; left everything and everyone behind. She was everywhere now, goddess bitch, and I cried and the tears were multicoloured in rust and acid-rain. Bejesus, the tentacle-junkie, wrapped his arms around me, and even Tone patted me on the back, there, there, awkwardly.

I shrugged them off. Nest-brothers, we shared a hub in Tong Yun City years before, the asteroid-worm and the orbital hafmek and me &#8211; shared food and drugs and sex and minds &#8211; but we were younger then, on Mars.

Earth is different to anything you can imagine.

Picture a globe, a blue-green world&#8230; more base-level humans than anywhere [...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>I think we all remember the tragedy that was the second Highlander film. I certainly do. I mean, I'd just seen it two days prior. When the third film came out, I decided I liked the story enough to see Highlander III in theaters. Now, 18 years later, I'm watching it again.</description>

Certus per Bellum (Decided by War)
By S. Hutson Blount
&#8220;It&#8217;s quiet outside,&#8221; Nohaile said, trying to find a comfortable way to sit in his armor suit. &#8220;Are you sure it&#8217;s started?&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;ll get plenty loud,&#8221; said the girl. She was armored only in a ratty sweatshirt and a patched bib coverall. She&#8217;d entered the bunker
with a vest and some sensible-looking boots, but promptly removed them. Her bare feet made her look about twelve years old. &#8220;For right
now,&#8221; she continued after some rapid two-thumb typing on her hand console, &#8220;we got time to kill.&#8221;
&#8220;Miz Bamboo, do you think we can win?&#8221; Nohaile had a matching helmet to go with his armor. He felt foolish either leaving it off or putting it on, so it worried in his hands.
The girl laughed a little. It didn&#8217;t reach her eyes. &#8220;There&#8217;s no &#8216;miz.&#8217; Bamboo is my handle, not my name.&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;
&#8220;No worries. And yeah, we can win. The other guy hired cheap.&#8221;
Bamboo kept looking at the display on her console, checking through her seemingly-infinite pockets and producing unidentifiable items to
inspect and disappear again. Everything she carried seemed dirty but functional.
Nohaile looked down at his shiny armor suit and was ashamed.
&#8220;So, when do I get the story?&#8221; Bamboo asked.
&#8220;I thought you said you didn&#8217;t care about the circumstances of the lawsuit.&#8221; She&#8217;d been very clear on that point. Rude, even.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t. But every client has to tell. You care enough about whatever this disagreement is to put your ass on the line. You might as well get it over with.&#8221;
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to burden you while you&#8217;re&#8230;&#8221; He gestured at her control pad, blinking and murmuring to itself on the concrete floor beside
her.
She&#8217;d produced a handgun hidden somewhere in that shapeless coverall, a considerable-looking piece of artillery. To Nohaile&#8217;s inexperienced eyes, it looked like it would break her wrists if fired.
Bamboo stopped disassembling it and looked at him more pointedly. &#8220;Where did you say you were from, again?&#8221;
&#8220;Baltimore,&#8221; Nohaile said. &#8220;Before that, Dire Dawa. In Ethiopia,&#8221; he added, because he knew he would have to.
&#8220;They grow &#8216;em polite in Ethiopia, I guess. Burden away. When something happens, I promise I&#8217;ll take care of it.&#8221; She grinned at him, freckles behind straw-colored bangs.
Nohaile set his streamlined, buglike helmet beside him. &#8220;It was a patent infringement case. Originally, I mean. I had tried to interest
VesterDyne in my extrusion bearing process. Shortly after the first round of presentations, they cancelled the exploratory contract. They said they&#8217;d found another source with a similar product. I knew it couldn&#8217;t be similar, I had a patent.&#8221;

The Cartographer Wasps and the Anarchist Bees
By E. Lily Yu
For longer than anyone could remember, the village of Yiwei had worn, in its orchards and under its eaves, clay-colored globes of paper that hissed and fizzed with wasps. The villagers maintained an uneasy peace with their neighbors for many years, exercising inimitable tact and circumspection. But it all ended the day a boy, digging in the riverbed, found a stone whose balance and weight pleased him. With this, he thought, he could hit a sparrow in flight. There were no sparrows to be seen, but a paper ball hung low and inviting nearby. He considered it for a moment, head cocked, then aimed and threw.
Much later, after he had been plastered and soothed, his mother scalded the fallen nest until the wasps seething in the paper were dead. In this way it was discovered that the wasp nests of Yiwei, dipped in hot water, unfurled into beautifully accurate maps of provinces near and far, inked in vegetable pigments and labeled in careful Mandarin that could be distinguished beneath a microscope.
The villagers&#8217; subsequent incursions with bee veils and kettles of boiling water soon diminished the prosperous population to a handful. Commanded by a single stubborn foundress, the survivors folded a new nest in the shape of a paper boat, provisioned it with fallen apricots and squash blossoms, and launched themselves onto the river. Browsing cows and children fled the riverbanks as they drifted downstream, piping sea chanteys.
At last, forty miles south from where they had begun, their craft snagged on an upthrust stick and sank. Only one drowned in the evacuation, weighed down with the remains of an apricot. They reconvened upon a stump and looked about themselves.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a good place to land,&#8221; the foundress said in her sweet soprano, examining the first rough maps that the scouts brought back. There were plenty of caterpillars, oaks for ink galls, fruiting brambles, and no signs of other wasps. A colony of bees had hived in a split oak two miles away. &#8220;Once we are established we will, of course, send a delegation to collect tribute.
&#8220;We will not make the same mistakes as before. Ours is a race of explorers and scientists, cartographers and philosophers, and to rest and grow slothful is to die. Once we are established here, we will expand.&#8221;
It took two weeks to complete the nurseries with their paper mobiles, and then another month to reconstruct the Great Library and fill the pigeonholes with what the oldest cartographers could remember of their lost maps. Their comings and goings did not go unnoticed. An ambassador from the beehive arrived with an ultimatum and was promptly executed; her wings were made into stained-glass windows for the council chamber, and her stinger was returned to the hive in a paper envelope. The second ambassador came with altered attitude and a proposal to divide the bees&#8217; kingdom evenly between the two governments, retaining pollen and water rights for the bees&#8212;&#8221;as an acknowledgment of the preexisting claims of a free people to the natural resources of a common territory,&#8221; she hummed.
The wasps of the council were gracious and only divested the envoy of her sting. She survived just long enough to deliver her account to the hive.
The third ambassador arrived with a ball of wax on the tip of her stinger and was better received.
&#8220;You understand, we are not refugees applying for recognition of a token territorial sovereignty,&#8221; the foundress said, as attendants served them nectars in paper horns, &#8220;nor are we negotiating with you as equal states. Those were the assumptions of your late predecessors. They were mistaken.&#8221;
&#8220;I trust I will do better,&#8221; the diplomat said stiffly. She was older than[...]</ns2:summary>

The Homecoming
by Mike Resnick
I don&#8217;t know which bothers me more, my lumbago or my arthritis. One day it&#8217;s one, one day it&#8217;s the other. They can cure cancer and transplant every damned organ in your body; you&#8217;d think they could find some way to get rid of aches and pains. Let me tell you, growing old isn&#8217;t for sissies.
I remember that I was having a typical dream. Well, typical for me, anyway. I was climbing the four steps to my front porch, only when I got to the third step there were six more, so I climbed them and then there were ten more, and it went on and on. I&#8217;d probably still be climbing them if the creature hadn&#8217;t woke me up.
It stood next to my bed, staring down at me. I blinked a couple of times, trying to focus my eyes, and stared back, sure this was just an extension of my dream.
It was maybe six feet tall, its skin a glistening, almost metallic silver, with multi-faceted bright red eyes like an insect. Its ears were pointed and batlike, and moved independently of its head and each other. Its mouth jutted out a couple of inches like some kind of tube, and looked like it was only good for sucking fluids. Its arms were slender, with no hint of the muscles required to move them, and its fingers were thin and incredibly elongated. It was as weird a nightmare figure as I&#8217;d dreamed up in years.
Finally it spoke, in a voice that sounded more like a set of chimes than anything else.
&#8220;Hello, Dad,&#8221; it said.
That&#8217;s when I knew I was awake.
&#8220;So this is what you look like,&#8221; I growled, swinging my feet over the side of the bed and sitting up. &#8220;What the hell are you doing here?&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you too,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;You didn&#8217;t answer my question,&#8221; I said, feeling around for my slippers.
&#8220;I heard about Mom &#8211; not from you, of course &#8211; and I wanted to see her once more before the end.&#8221;
&#8220;Can you see through those things?&#8221; I asked, indicating his eyes.
&#8220;Better than you can.&#8221;
Big surprise. Hell, everyone can see better than I can.
&#8220;How did you get in here anyway?&#8221; I said as I got to my feet. The furnace was as old and tired as I was and there was a chill in the air, so I put on my robe.
&#8220;You haven&#8217;t changed the front door&#8217;s code words since I left.&#8221; He looked around the room. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t painted the place either.&#8221;
&#8220;The lock&#8217;s supposed to check your retinagram or read your DNA or something.&#8221;
&#8220;It did. They haven&#8217;t changed.&#8221;
I looked him up and down. &#8220;The hell they haven&#8217;t.&#8221;
He seemed about to reply, then thought better of it. Finally he said, &#8220;How is she?&#8221;
&#8220;She has her bad days and her worse days,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;She&#8217;s the old Julia maybe two or three times a week for a minute or two, but that&#8217;s all. She can still speak, and she still recognizes me.&#8221; I paused. &#8220;She won&#8217;t recognize you, of course, but nobody else you ever knew will either.&#8221;
&#8220;How long has she been like this?&#8221;
&#8220;Maybe a year.&#8221;
&#8220;You should have told me,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Why?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;You gave up being her son and became whatever it is you are now.&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;m still her son, and you had my contact information.&#8221;
I stared at him. &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re not my son, not anymore.&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you feel that way,&#8221; he replied. Suddenly he sniffed the air. &#8220;It smells stale.&#8221;
&#8220;Tired old houses are like tired old men,&#8221; I said. &#8220;They don&#8217;t function on all cylinders.&#8221;
&#8220;You could move to a smaller, newer place.&#8221;
&#8220;This house and me, we&#8217;ve grown old together. Not everyone wants to move to Alpha whatever-the-hell-it-is.&#8221;
He looked around. &#8220;Where is she?&#8221;
&#8220;In your old room,&#8221; I said.
He turned, walked out into the hall. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you replaced that thing yet?&#8221; he asked, indicating an old wall table. &#8220;It was scarred and wobbly when I still lived here.&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s just a table. It holds whatever I put on it. That&#8217;s all it has to do.&#8221;
He looked up at the ceiling. &#8220;The paint&#8217;s peeling too.&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;m too old to do it myself, and painters cost mon[...]</ns2:summary>

Movement
By Nancy Fulda
It is sunset.  The sky is splendid through the panes of my bedroom window; billowing layers of cumulous blazing with refracted oranges and reds.  I think if only it weren&#8217;t for the glass, I could reach out and touch the cloudscape, perhaps leave my own trail of turbulence in the swirling patterns that will soon deepen to indigo.
But the window is there, and I feel trapped.
Behind me my parents and a specialist from the neurological research institute are sitting on folding chairs they&#8217;ve brought in from the kitchen, quietly discussing my future.  They do not know I am listening.  They think that, because I do not choose to respond,  I do not notice they are there.
&#8220;Would there be side effects?&#8221; My father asks.  In the oppressive heat of the evening, I hear the quiet Zzzapof his shoulder laser as it targets mosquitoes.  The device is not as effective as it was two years ago: the mosquitoes are getting faster.
My father is a believer in technology, and that is why he contacted the research institute.  He wants to fix me.  He is certain there is a way.
&#8220;There would be no side effects in the traditional sense,&#8221;the specialist says.  I like him even though his presence makes me uncomfortable.  He chooses his words very precisely.  &#8220;We&#8217;re talking about direct synaptic grafting, not drugs.  The process is akin to bending a sapling to influence the shape of the grown tree.  We boost the strength of key dendritic connections and allow brain development to continue naturally. Young neurons are very malleable.&#8221;
&#8220;And you&#8217;ve done this before?&#8221;  I do not have to look to know my mother is frowning.
My mother does not trust technology.  She has spent the last ten years trying to coax me into social behavior by gentler means.  She loves me, but she does not understand me.  She thinks I cannot be happy unless I am smiling and laughing and running along the beach with other teenagers.
&#8220;The procedure is still new, but our first subject was a young woman about the same age as your daughter.  Afterwards, she integrated wonderfully.  She was never an exceptional student, but she began speaking more and had an easier time following classroom procedure.&#8221;
&#8220;What about Hannah&#8217;s&#8230;talents?&#8221;my mother asks.  I know she is thinking about my dancing; also the way I remember facts and numbers without trying. &#8220;Would she lose those?&#8221;
The specialist&#8217;s voice is very firm, and I like the way he delivers the facts without trying to cushion them.  &#8220;It&#8217;s a matter of trade-offs, Mrs. Didier.  The brain cannot be optimized for everything at once.  Without treatment, some children like Hannah develop into extraordinary individuals. They become famous, change the world, learn to integrate their abilities into the structures of society.  But only a very few are that lucky. The others never learn to make friends, hold a job, or live outside of institutions.&#8221;
&#8220;And&#8230; with treatment?&#8221;
&#8220;I cannot promise anything, but the chances are very good that Hannah will lead a normal life.&#8221;
I have pressed my hand to the window.  The glass feels cold and smooth beneath my palm.  It appears motionless although I know at the molecular level it is flowing.  Its atoms slide past each other slowly, so slowly; a transformation no less inevitable for its tempo.  I like glass &#8212; also stone &#8212; because it does not change very quickly.  I will be dead, and so will all of my relatives and their descendants, before the deformations will be visible without a microscope.
I feel my mother&#8217;s hands on my shoulders.  She has come up behind me and now she turns me so that I must either look in her eyes or pull away.  I lo[...]</ns2:summary>

&#160;The Paper Menagerie
by Ken Liu
One of my earliest memories starts with me sobbing. I refused to be soothed no matter what Mom and Dad tried.
Dad gave up and left the bedroom, but Mom took me into the kitchen and sat me down at the breakfast table.
&#8220;Kan, kan,&#8221; she said, as she pulled a sheet of wrapping paper from on top of the fridge. For years, Mom carefully sliced open the wrappings around Christmas gifts and saved them on top of the fridge in a thick stack.
She set the paper down, plain side facing up, and began to fold it. I stopped crying and watched her, curious.
She turned the paper over and folded it again. She pleated, packed, tucked, rolled, and twisted until the paper disappeared between her cupped hands. Then she lifted the folded-up paper packet to her mouth and blew into it, like a balloon.
&#8220;Kan,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Laohu.&#8221; She put her hands down on the table and let go.
A little paper tiger stood on the table, the size of two fists placed together. The skin of the tiger was the pattern on the wrapping paper, white background with red candy canes and green Christmas trees.
I reached out to Mom&#8217;s creation. Its tail twitched, and it pounced playfully at my finger. &#8220;Rawrr-sa,&#8221; it growled, the sound somewhere between a cat and rustling newspapers.
I laughed, startled, and stroked its back with an index finger. The paper tiger vibrated under my finger, purring.
&#8220;Zhe jiao zhezhi,&#8221; Mom said. This is called origami.
I didn&#8217;t know this at the time, but Mom&#8217;s kind was special. She breathed into them so that they shared her breath, and thus moved with her life. This was her magic.
#
Dad had picked Mom out of a catalog.
One time, when I was in high school, I asked Dad about the details. He was trying to get me to speak to Mom again.
He had signed up for the introduction service back in the spring of 1973. Flipping through the pages steadily, he had spent no more than a few seconds on each page until he saw the picture of Mom.
I&#8217;ve never seen this picture. Dad described it: Mom was sitting in a chair, her side to the camera, wearing a tight green silk cheongsam. Her head was turned to the camera so that her long black hair was draped artfully over her chest and shoulder. She looked out at him with the eyes of a calm child.
&#8220;That was the last page of the catalog I saw,&#8221; he said.
The catalog said she was eighteen, loved to dance, and spoke good English because she was from Hong Kong. None of these facts turned out to be true.
He wrote to her, and the company passed their messages back and forth. Finally, he flew to Hong Kong to meet her.
&#8220;The people at the company had been writing her responses. She didn&#8217;t know any English other than &#8216;hello&#8217; and &#8216;goodbye.&#8217;&#8221;
What kind of woman puts herself into a catalog so that she can be bought? The high school me thought I knew so much about everything. Contempt felt good, like wine.
Instead of storming into the office to demand his money back, he paid a waitress at the hotel restaurant to translate for them.
&#8220;She would look at me, her eyes halfway between scared and hopeful, while I spoke. And when the girl began translating what I said, she&#8217;d start to smile slowly.&#8221;
He flew back to Connecticut and began to apply for the papers for her to come to him. I was born a year later, in the Year of the Tiger.
#
At my request, Mom also made a goat, a deer, and a water buffalo out of wrapping paper. They would run around the living room while Laohu chased after them, growling. When he caught them he would press down until the air went out of them and they became just flat, folded-up pieces of paper. I would then have to blow into them to re-inflate them so they could r[...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>It doesn't take much effort to observe that I've been on one hell of a Joss Whedon kick over the course of the past year. So when Amazon's algorithm suggested I purchase PopMatters's &lt;i&gt;Joss Whedon: The Complete Companion&lt;/i&gt;, I figured it would be something I'd enjoy.</description>

Hawksbill Station
by Robert Silverberg
Barrett was the uncrowned King of Hawksbill Station. He had been there the longest; he had suffered the most; he had the deepest inner resources of strength. Before his accident, he had been able to whip any man in the place. Now he was a cripple, but he still had that aura of power that gave him command. When there were problems at the Station, they were brought to Barrett. That was axiomatic. He was the king.
He ruled over quite a kingdom, too. In effect it was the whole world, pole to pole, meridian to meridian. For what it was worth. It wasn&#8217;t worth very much.
Now it was raining again. Barrett shrugged himself to his feet in the quick, easy gesture that cost him an infinite amount of carefully concealed agony, and shuffled to the door of his hut. Rain made him impatient:. the pounding of those great greasy drops against the corrugated tin roof was enough even to drive a Jim Barrett loony. He nudged the door open. Standing in the doorway, Barrett looked out over his kingdom.
Barren rock, nearly to the horizon. A shield of raw dolomite going on and on. Raindrops danced and bounced on that continental slab of rock. No trees. No grass. Behind Barrett&#8217;s hut lay the sea, gray and vast. The sky was gray too, even when it wasn&#8217;t raining.
He hobbled out into the rain. Manipulating his crutch was getting to be a simple matter for him now. He leaned comfortably, letting his crushed left foot dangle. A rockslide had pinned him last year during a trip to the edge of the Inland Sea. Back home, Barrett would have been fitted with prosthetics and that would have been the end of it: a new ankle, a new instep, refurbished ligaments and tendons. But home was a billion years away, and home there&#8217;s no returning.
The rain hit him hard. Barrett was a big man, six and a half feet tall, with hooded dark eyes, a jutting nose, a chin that was a monarch among chins. He had weighed two hundred fifty pounds in his prime, in the good old agitating days when he had carried banners and pounded out manifestos. But now he was past sixty and beginning to shrink a little, the skin getting loose around the places where the mighty muscles used to be. It was hard to keep your weight in Hawksbill Station. The food was nutritious, but it lacked intensity. A man got to miss steak. Eating brachiopod stew and trilobite hash wasn&#8217;t the same thing at all. Barrett was past all bitterness, though. That was another reason why the men regarded him as the leader. He didn&#8217;t scowl. He didn&#8217;t rant. He was resigned to his fate, tolerant of eternal exile, and so he could help the others get over that difficult, heart-clawing period of transition.
A figure arrived, jogging through the rain: Norton. The doctrinaire Khrushchevist with the Trotskyite leanings. A small, excitable man who frequently appointed himself messenger whenever there was news at the Station. He sprinted toward Barrett&#8217;s hut, slipping and sliding over the naked rocks.
Barrett held up a meaty hand. &#8220;Whoa, Charley. Take it easy or you&#8217;ll break your neck!&#8221;
Norton halted in front of the hut. The rain had pasted the widely spaced strands of his brown hair to his skull. His eyes had the fixed, glossy look of fanaticism&#8212;or perhaps just astigmatism. He gasped for breath and staggered into the hut, shaking himself like a wet puppy. He obviously had run all the way from the main building of the Station, three hundred yards away&#8212;a long dash over rock that slippery.
&#8220;Why are you standing around in the rain?&#8221; Norton asked.
&#8220;To get wet,&#8221; said Barrett, following him inside. &#8220;What&#8217;s the news?&#8221;
&#8220;The Hammer&#8217;s glowing. We&#8217;re getting company.&#8221;
&#8220;How do you know it&#8217;s a live shipment?&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s been glowing for half an hour. That means they&#8217;re taking precautions. They&#8217;re sending a new prisoner. Anyway, no supplies[...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>In watching &lt;i&gt;Angel&lt;/i&gt;, I'd heard there was a puppet episode coming up. I didn't have high hopes for it. But after seeing what Whedon and his team did with a musical episode on &lt;i&gt;Buffy&lt;/i&gt;, I should've learned to just stop worrying and trust in Whedon.</description>

Next Time, Scales
by John Moran
&#8220;You&#8217;re too restless,&#8221; the lizard whispered into my brain.
&#8220;And you&#8217;ve been at the reactor fuel again.&#8221;
Marla slapped her prehensile tail onto the table, cracking its surface with her paralysing stinger and rattling the chess pieces. The blow echoed through the control room.
&#8220;I hate it when you do that, Steven.&#8221;
&#8220;Do what?&#8221;
&#8220;Think you can read me.&#8221;
I smiled. &#8220;Your underarm scales are pale, which means a supercharged diet or zero-gravity. As we haven&#8217;t been off-planet, it must be the
food. Plus, your breath stinks of sulphur and your claws have white rings.&#8221;
Marla pointed one crimson eye at the table, but kept the other on me.
&#8220;Your move,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Give me time. Why do you think I&#8217;m restless?&#8221;
&#8220;Because you&#8217;ve spent the last three weeks researching Loris, and done each patrol fully armed.&#8221;
I glanced through the window, as if by chance I might catch our thief creeping up in plain view, but all I saw were two huge moons glowering over the ruined planet, its civilisation long-dead, part-excavated and full of secrets.
I couldn&#8217;t let Marla know the site had me spooked, though. Her people had been hunters for a thousand years, and, through a quirk of fate, she believed in me.
&#8220;Right.&#8221; I said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s patrol.&#8221; I got most of the way to the door before I realised what the click behind me had meant. &#8220;And you can put that piece back.&#8221;
&#8220;Damn,&#8221; Marla said.
The night was darker than usual, but I left off my flashlight and navigated by the excavation&#8217;s amber glow. After two months I&#8217;d learned
the drill pretty well: walk three steps from the door before turning right, drop down through the first causeway, crunch my way over rubble and calcified ferns, pass beside three thousand year old shop windows, then into what people said were the temples of the spider-creatures that had once ruled Artemis.
As I walked, Marla leapt from one wall to another like a shooting star. She looked beautiful, her scales shining like jewels.
&#8220;Why you care so much about an urban legend?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;Because he&#8217;s a mystery. For two hundred years, Loris has been stealing artifacts, leaving only the letter L engraved onto the wall. Who wouldn&#8217;t be interested?&#8221;
&#8220;He&#8217;s only human, Steven.&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure. We didn&#8217;t have the technology to grow new bodies two centuries ago, so if he&#8217;s human, how has he lived so long?&#8221;
Marla was silent for a while, then she said, &#8220;however good he is, I bet you&#8217;re better.&#8221;
I walked away, unhappy with false praise. Instead, I ducked through the first arch, and stepped out below the huge, half-buried alien
machine. Next to it, the laboratories and excavating machines looked forlorn and tiny. Forty archaeologists worked here in Artemis&#8217; summer, but none had yet figured out what the machine did.
&#8220;Perhaps you regret our melding?&#8221; Marla whispered, her voice quavering.
&#8220;Not for a moment.&#8221;
&#8220;Then why do you seek out complications?&#8221;
&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;
&#8220;Loris, for instance. He&#8217;s just another hunt. So &#8212;&#8221;
&#8220;&#8212; Marla?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes?&#8221;
&#8220;The machine&#8217;s active.&#8221;
She appeared at my shoulder, scuttled up to the machine and crouched, eyes twitching in different directions. What had previously been a
mountain of dark metal now held a tiny panel that shimmered like oil on water. As we watched, it faded to black.
&#8220;Intriguing,&#8221; Marla said.
&#8220;Still think Loris is a myth?&#8221;
&#8220;I think we need to be careful.&#8221;
She left in a blur, dancin[...]</ns2:summary>

Nemesis
by Nathaniel Lee
It was the middle of second-period Spanish when I felt my cell phone go off in my pocket.  Three pulses, then two.  That meant one of my alerts had hit paydirt.  I&#8217;ve got newsfeeds filtered for keywords, pairing &#8220;emergency&#8221; and the names of every local school and business I could think of, plus I got Kenny from sixth period computer Science to cobble together a kind of hack on the actual first responders&#8217; radio channels.  If my phone had gone off, then there was trouble. 
If there was trouble, then the city needed Atom Boy.
So where was he?
Well, if I was in Spanish, then he was in History.  No, wait, he&#8217;d dropped the AP course.  Did he have some kind of math now instead?  Crud.  I had no idea.  I&#8217;d lost our hero.
&#8220;Miss Ramsey?&#8221;
&#8220;Ahem!&#8221;
&#8220;Uh, um, I mean, uh, Se&#241;ora Ramsey?&#8221;
&#8221; S&#237;, Quentin?&#8221;
&#8220;Yo, uh, yo poder uso el ba&#241;o?&#8221;
&#8220;Puedo.  Y s&#237;, se puede.  Andale.&#8221;
I clapped a hand over my pocket to keep my phone-bulge hidden and ran out of the classroom, careful to turn to the right as if I were heading for the boy&#8217;s room.  A couple of months ago, that wouldn&#8217;t have been a bad idea; I&#8217;d discovered Adam&#8217;s secret when I walked in on him trying to get out of his tights at the end of fourth period.  Which he&#8217;d missed, by the way, and I&#8217;d had to cover for him and pretend like I&#8217;d gotten a text from his mom about an emergency dental appointment.
Nowadays, I made him use the locked room in the old elementary school building, next door to the art room.  I had a key because Mr. Adelaide trusted me to use it only to work on my project.  I felt bad about abusing that trust, but I figure helping a superhero save the world every week counts as some sort of civic duty.  I checked there first.
Adam was sitting at one of the old desks, his feet sticking out about a mile because it was designed for five-year-olds.  He had his suit half on.  His pale chest was bare, exposing those three wispy little curls that he was so proud of.  He didn&#8217;t look up when I came in. 
&#8220;Adam?  What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;ve lost my powers.&#8221;  His voice was dull, his eyes unfocused.  He sounded grim and deadly serious.
&#8220;Oh, for crying out loud, Adam, we&#8217;ve been over this.  Remember, last month?  You thought it was some kind of lingering effect from the Recluse&#8217;s poison bite, but it was all psychosoma-whosit.&#8221;  I ran in and snatched up his backpack, rummaging for his pill-box.  &#8220;Have you been taking your Paxil?&#8221;
&#8220;It made me gassy.  I&#8217;m on a new one now.  Starts with an &#8216;s,&#8217; I think.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, whatever it is, have you been taking it?&#8221;
&#8220;No!  I want to be me, not what some drug makes me.&#8221;
I resisted the urge to punch him.  It would be like hitting a steel wall, anyway.  Instead, I found the box and opened it.  The previous week&#8217;s pills were all still in their slots.  White pills, red pills, blue pills.  Patriotic.  &#8220;Which one is it?&#8221;
Adam shrugged.
&#8220;Argh!&#8221;  I pulled out one of each, thought about it, then made it two of each.  He had superpowers.  He could take it.  &#8220;Here.  Take these and get a move on.&#8221;
Adam picked the pills up.  &#8220;I told you, I lost my powers.&#8221;
&#8220;You did not.&#8221;
&#8220;Did so.&#8221;
I glared at him.  This called for drastic measures.  I turned, picked up a wooden dowel from the supply table, closed my eyes, and whacked him over the head.  I used my right hand this time; my left is my drawing hand, and I didn&#8217;t want to lose it for two weeks.  The actinic flash was blinding even through my eyel[...]</ns2:summary>

This is how I find out that I&#8217;m pregnant:
I wake up to find Carter standing next to my bed. The fire escape door is open behind him, so the rising sun silhouettes his body. A human silhouette, albeit a little crisper than it should be, as his body bends the light towards him, powering up. Always powering up.
&#8220;You&#8217;re pregnant,&#8221; he says. No particular emphasis on the words, which is as per usual, his voice being run through vocal cords that are not human, formed by lips that have blown hurricanes off course. It&#8217;s not that he doesn&#8217;t feel emotion, he tells me and anyone else who&#8217;ll listen. It&#8217;s just that he doesn&#8217;t have the same biologically hardwired ways of showing it. Usually I believe him.
&#8220;What?&#8221; I rub my eyes, push up on one elbow. &#8220;That&#8217;s not possible.&#8221;
He leans over me, and touches my stomach. &#8220;I was flying by your apartment, thinking about you. I heard the heartbeat.&#8221;
&#8220;You told me that was impossible,&#8221; I say.
He frowns and asks, &#8220;I told you it was impossible for me to hear the .&#160;.&#160;.&#8221;
&#8220;Conceiving, Carter,&#8221; I say. &#8220;You told me it was impossible for us to conceive.&#8221;
&#8220;I thought it was. I was wrong.&#8221; His frown deepens. &#8220;I could take care of it for you right now if you want.&#8221;
I push Carter away from me and sit up. &#8220;For me, Carter?! You mean for us, right?&#8221;
&#8220;Right. That&#8217;s what I meant.&#8221; A pause, then. &#8220;You&#8217;re freezing the bed, Margaret.&#8221;
I glance down. Damn it. I&#8217;ve covered myself and the bed with a thin layer of ice. I take a deep breath and try to calm down before I do any permanent damage to my bed.
It strikes me that this whole thing smells of Dr. U. &#8220;Any idea where Dr. U is these days?&#8221; I say.
Carter shakes his head. &#8220;Ambrosius is reformed. This isn&#8217;t one of his plots, Margaret. You&#8212;we&#8212;have to decide what we&#8217;re going to do.&#8221; He winces. &#8220;Shoot. Bank robbery in Chicago. I have to go.&#8221;
He&#8217;s gone before I can respond.
&#8220;I should never date other supers,&#8221; I say, not for the first time. I put my hand on my stomach. Crap. I can barely keep a spider plant alive. There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m ready to be a mother.
I look back at the bed and wave my hand at it, heating the molecules surrounding it until the sheets are dry and warm. Then I call in sick to my norm-identity job at the advertising firm, and get back into bed. Of course I can&#8217;t sleep.
After an hour of lying in bed, I get up and spend what&#8217;s left of the morning surfing the Internet for information on pregnancy. My Battalion cell phone rings a few times, but I don&#8217;t pick up. A few minutes before noon, I hear a tap on the window behind me and find Carter is hovering outside. &#8220;Come on in,&#8221; I say.
A blur as he detours through the fire escape door in my bedroom and into my apartment. I know. It&#8217;s weird&#8212;he lets himself in while I&#8217;m asleep, but if I&#8217;m awake, he&#8217;ll always wait until I invite him in.
He runs his hands through his hair. &#8220;Why weren&#8217;t you answering the phone?&#8221;
I roll my eyes. If he wants, Carter can fly faster than the signal on a phone. &#8220;What, did the bank robbery in Chicago hold you up?&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s a tough conversation. I thought it might be easier for you to have it from a distance.&#8221;
&#8220;Easier for me?&#8221; I briefly consider incinerating Carter&#8217;s costume. I&#8217;m pretty sure I could keep the heat contained, but if I&#8217;m wrong I&#8217;ll end up having to evacuate the building and pay the fire damages. Again. Still, I&#8217;m thinking it might be wor[...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>Imagine that, a year or so ago, you saw a trailer for a film in which humanity discovered another planet Earth growing slowly closer. Imagine someone made a film about it. Imagine seeing that film and realizing that the trailer doesn't really tell you what the actual plot of the movie is. That's &lt;i&gt;Another Earth&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

Observer Effects
By Tim Pratt
&#8220;Ubiquitous surveillance isn&#8217;t the problem. Asymmetrical ubiquitous surveillance is the problem.&#8221; The Liberator was playing Chinese checkers against himself and talking, talking, talking, like always. &#8220;Who watches the watchmen, after all?&#8221;
We were superheroes then. Celebrities, back when there were such things. It was a slow night at orbital headquarters, and Eye-Oh was
sitting at the big screen, watching a couple of people fuck &#8212; consensually, or we would have done something about it &#8212; in an
alleyway. The screen was green with night-vision enhancements, and Eye-Oh&#8217;s strange complicated face was perfectly placid and empty as he observed.
&#8220;The problem is that we can watch ordinary people, and they can&#8217;t watch us,&#8221; the Liberator went on. He looked at me longingly, searchingly, and I thought it might be nice to tweak the inside of his brain and get rid of his earnestness, give him a little taste of what infamous brain-damage victim Phineas Gage got when that iron bar slammed through his frontal lobe, a total personality turnaround, from nice guy to sociopath. Let the Liberator be selfish and impulsive and violent and mercurial for a while, so he could appreciate the way normal avaricious sneaky hungry desperate needy people felt.
But that was supervillain thinking, and I&#8217;d gone straight and narrow. In those days I cured neurological damage instead of inflicting it. I fixed people. (Except bad people. Those, I was sometimes still allowed to play with with.) I&#8217;d refused to give up my supervillain name though. The Liberator had wanted to call me &#8220;Dr. Neuro&#8221; when I joined his little boys&#8217; club, but I&#8217;d insisted on keeping my maiden name, as it were. Doctor. Please. I was a high-school dropout.
&#8220;Do you see?&#8221; the Liberator said. &#8220;If ordinary people could see us, if everyone could see everyone else, it wouldn&#8217;t matter if there were no privacy.&#8221;
&#8220;Mmm,&#8221; I said, and tried to keep reading my book, a physics textbook. I was deep into a chapter on Heisenberg. His big achievement was the uncertainty principle, which says you can&#8217;t know both the position and the momentum of a given particle at the same time. (I know, you know that. But like I said, I didn&#8217;t do much school. I had a lot of catching up to do if I was going to hang with the super-science
types.) I always thought the uncertainty principle had something to do with observing, how just the act of looking at something changed its nature, but apparently that&#8217;s a whole different thing, called the observer effect. That&#8217;s the kind of confusion you get when your grasp of physics comes from made-for-TV science fiction movies named after the monster that eats the boyfriend in the second act. I wasn&#8217;t too clear on the implications of the uncertainty principle, but I understood the observer effect. Me and the boys observed things all the time &#8212; Eye-Oh observed _everything_ all the time &#8212; and we sure as hell changed what we saw if we thought it needed changing.
&#8220;In cultures where many people live in the same house, or otherwise in close quarters, they develop coping mechanisms to deal with the lack of privacy,&#8221; the Liberator said. &#8220;They are capable not just of ignoring one another, but of genuinely _not noticing_ certain actions or behaviors of a personal and intimate nature. If everyone in the world could see everyone else, at will, we would all surely develop those same skills, do you see? Selective blindness for the greater social good.&#8221;
&#8220;Sure, sure,&#8221; I said, and turned a page.
&#8220;But for now it&#8217;s one-way. We can watch ordinary people, and see them[...]</ns2:summary>

113 Feet
By Josh Roseman
&#8220;This is a really bad idea, Elle,&#8221; Barry says.
&#8220;You didn&#8217;t have to come.&#8221;
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be stupid,&#8221; he snaps. &#8220;Phil would kill me if I didn&#8217;t come with you.&#8221;
Barry is fiftyish, portly and gray-haired. Seeing him take off his shirt is an experience I wish I&#8217;d never had.
&#8220;I have friends with certifications,&#8221; I say. &#8220;It&#8217;s not like I couldn&#8217;t have asked one of them.&#8221;
&#8220;How many of them have actually been down there?&#8221; It&#8217;s almost a growl, and I&#8217;m actually cowed a little. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I thought.&#8221;
I sit on the hard bench, wood planks covered in thin, all-weather carpet, and fiddle with my regulator.
&#8220;How far away do you think we are?&#8221; he asks.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t know. Ask the captain.&#8221;
Barry looks up at the bridge, where Al &#8212; the captain &#8212; stands, driving the boat. Al is even older than Barry, narrow and hard and tanned almost leathery with decades of exposure to the sun. Instead of going up to talk to him, though, Barry goes around the cabin to stand by the bow, leaving me bouncing up and down on the bench as the boat zips across the water. The light chop makes the horizon rise and fall faster than is comfortable. I can take it, though, and if I get sick enough to throw up, at least I know enough to do it over the side.
My guess is that we&#8217;re ten minutes from the dive site. Maybe fifteen.
After waiting seven years to get my answers, fifteen minutes isn&#8217;t much of a wait at all.
#
I was seven when I first realized my dad was doing more than just studying the life cycle of coral reefs. I&#8217;d been in the ocean with Grandpa; I knew what they looked like. I knew there were natural ones and artificial ones; I knew that if you touched a reef, part of it could die, and that if you touched fire coral, you&#8217;d burn.
The big tank at Dad&#8217;s office had plenty of coral inside. I separated myself from him &#8212; it was easy; he was so focused on his work that when I said I had to go to the bathroom he didn&#8217;t even notice &#8212; and went off on my own.
No one watched me climb up on a chair. No one noticed my nose was so close to the water that all I could smell was salt. No one saw me reach in and brush the back of my hand on the bright-orange coral flower.
The scream made Dad come running. He picked me up as I cried and shouted, carried me to a chair, and told me to hold out my arm. Then he poured clear liquid over my skin: vinegar, like what Mom used to clean the floor. It didn&#8217;t make the burn stop hurting, but it helped, and after a few minutes I started to calm down.
&#8220;What happened?&#8221;
When I looked at Dad, it was through a blur of tears. &#8220;I reached in the tank,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I touched the coral.&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, come on!&#8221; Dad said &#8212; almost yelled. &#8220;I&#8217;ve told you before: this isn&#8217;t a game! It&#8217;s not a place to play! This is my job, and if you can&#8217;t behave, you can stay home with your brother next time. You got that?&#8221;
I stared at him for a second, then burst into fresh tears. Dad shook his head and crouched in front of me. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Eleanora. I didn&#8217;t mean to shout. You just&#8230; worried me. And you know you shouldn&#8217;t have touched something that was going to hurt you, right?&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8230;&#8221; A hiccup. &#8220;I&#8217;m&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry, Daddy&#8230;&#8221;
He leaned forward and hugged me, rubbing my back. &#8220;Come on. I&#8217;ll get my things, and we can go home.&#8221;
&#8220;&#8216;Kay.&#8221;
He asked me to sit in his desk chair and wait while he called Mom. He&#8217;d left his computer turned on, and I read[...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>It still amazes me that Philippa Ballantine can do in 280 pages what it takes some authors 800 or more to achieve. &lt;i&gt;Hunter and Fox&lt;/i&gt; is an interestingly-built world with compelling characters... but for some reason, I still didn't really feel satisfied when I finished the book.</description>

		<description>Sometimes movie trailers tell you exactly what the movie is about. Sometimes, the trailer says "you're going to watch a 100-minute live-action episode of &lt;i&gt;Family Guy&lt;/i&gt;, and you're going to laugh your ass off doing it." That's pretty much what &lt;i&gt;Ted&lt;/i&gt; is -- and it's hilarious.</description>

Food for Thought
By Laura Lee McArdle
He didn&#8217;t look much like the humans I knew&#8212;their eyes squinting out of wind-burnt faces from atop the backs of their rude horses. This one had a face like butter, not a wrinkle to be seen. And he didn&#8217;t arrive on a horse, rude or otherwise, just popped out of thin air and started talking to me. Not at me. To me.
&#8220;Slow down,&#8221; I said flicking a fly off my broad backside. &#8220;Wilfred, right? You are responsible for the fence posts?&#8221;
&#8220;Yeah sure,&#8221; said Wilfred. &#8220;Now listen to me. I just need a thirty second vignette when I say &#8216;action&#8217;. Can you do that for me?
&#8220;Sure,&#8221; I said. I love to talk about myself.
&#8220;You heard the animal,&#8221; he shouted to no one I could see. &#8220;Food For Thought, take one. Action!&#8221;
&#8220;Uh, Bess here. Folks call me the conspiracy theorist.&#160; And I laugh.&#160; But honestly if you don&#8217;t spend some time speculating out here what are you going to do?&#160; Me, I walk the fence, count the posts and calculate trigonometric functions.&#160; And I am convinced there is a way to get my 1200 lb bulk past these 4000 odd posts and reams of barbed wire.
By the way, I&#8217;ve come pretty far with the weight issue, thank you very much. The secret is small frequent meals, so I pretty much eat a little bit all the time when I&#8217;m not counting posts.&#160; The other trick, that I don&#8217;t think any of my sisters have clocked on to, is to just not use stomachs three and four. Sure it takes practice, even surgery for lesser minds, but if you don&#8217;t have a project out here you will simply go mad.
But I digress.&#160; The fence around East Pasture, the present location of my languid existence, has 4409 posts.&#160; That&#8217;s a rather large prime number. Coincidence? I think not! The fence is clearly a test to separate the truly intelligent from the herd.&#160; Since I am clearly at the pinnacle of bovine braininess and already somewhat estranged from my herd I know it&#8217;s only a matter of time before I pass.&#8221;
&#8220;Cut!&#8221; screamed Wilfred beaming. &#8220;Bess, my dear, that was gorgeous.&#160; You are a natural born&#8230; monologist.&#8221; He clapped and did a little dance that made his sequined garment bounce and sparkle in the sun.
&#8220;Monologist?&#160; Is that a word?&#8221;
&#8220;Whatever. You, the monologue&#8212;the viewers are going to lap it up. I,&#8221; &#8211;he paused for effect- &#8220;am a genius.&#8221;
I snorted. &#8220;I thought you said I was the genius.&#8221;
&#8220;Did I say that?&#160; I meant savant. Anyway, you found the posts and you&#8217;re coming in loud and clear on the translator, so season 24 is a go!&#8221; He degenerated into dancing again, executing an exuberant pirouette.
&#8220;Hold on a minute there Wilf. I did the little self-introduction you wanted.&#160; I&#8217;ve been extremely cooperative. Now fill me in.&#160; What&#8217;s the real deal with the fence?&#160; Where did you come from and why are you testing me?&#8221;
Wilfred poked a handheld device with his index finger and yelled instructions toward some point behind him.
&#8220;Frank! Roll cameras I need tape of this!&#8221;
&#8220;Rolling Wilf,&#8221; a disembodied voice answered.
&#8220;Excellent. Now Bess, you know those humans who come here, check you over, give you medicine?&#8221; He grinned in a way that raised the hair on the back of my neck.
&#8220;Yeah&#8221;.
He leaned in close to my twitching ears.
&#8220;They grind you up and eat you.&#8221;
&#8220;I knew it!&#8221; I bellowed and stamped. &#8220;I&#8217;ve said it over and over again, but no-one takes me seriously. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.&#8221; I trotted in circles trying not to hyperventilate while Wilfred watched with obvious pleasure. &#8220;Wait a second.&#8221; I rounded on Wilfred. &#8220;You&#8217;re [...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>I struggled mightily to find some things that stood out about this book. I managed to find a few, but it wasn't easy. Overall, &lt;i&gt;Kiss the Dead&lt;/i&gt; was a prosaic entry in the Anita Blake universe, and while fans will probably love it, average readers should just skip it.</description>

Talking to the Enemy
By Don Webb
We knew a little, but we knew the Free Machines knew more. We hoped our adversary, the Belatrin, knew less; but since they were such creatures of dream and nightmare even at the late parts of the War, we suspected they knew everything.
The Peace Conference hadn&#8217;t happened in the first six months of our being here. Everyone talked about it. Breakthroughs were rumored everyday. The only hard facts are that we had grown more efficient at killing Belatrin and they us.
The &#8220;peace planet&#8221; was named Mrs. Roger Fishbaum III. Roger Fishbaum had paid currency to name a star after his wife in the International Star Registry a thousand years before. The Siirians had a name for it that had too many clicks and whistles, the Free Machines a binary designation, and for all we knew the Belatrin used telepathy. The planet stank of vinegar and moldy bread. I always assumed that its atmosphere contained some needful compound for our enemies&#8217; breathing, but maybe the Free Machines choose it to annoy us, or them.
Siirian merchants made the most of our discomfort. They sold ineffective air shields that released some herbal concoction. I was buying one when I made my ironic remark about the peace talks. The merchant polished its carapace with two of its legs and whistled out a message that my implant made into, &#8220;Honored customer, do you think you will be the chief negotiator for the peace talks?&#8221;
I set my translator for ironic mode, and said, &#8220;Most certainly. My lowly position as a Viscount of the Instrumentality qualifies me far better than the Dukes of Diplomacy.&#8221;
&#8220;No doubt this is true my friend.&#8221; The implant registered no irony. His carapace had the oranges and whites of early middle age. He could have fought in the Human-Siirian wars, back when is all right to call them &#8220;Crabs&#8221; to their eyestalks. The high-ranking families of the bureaucracy had commanded legions seeking to kill him, while my family had huddled in the ghettos of Earth. His long claw, a good two meters, reached over and pinned the air shield to my shirt. &#8220;Wear it in good health, honored customer.&#8221;
I strolled back to the Bureau, where others of the tribe of hereditary Bureaucrats busied themselves in meeting the latest proposal by the Free Machines. Since no human and no Belatrin could sit within two hundred yards of each other without permanent psychic damage to both parties, the Free Machines had built a &#8220;Peace Palace&#8221; where they would conduct negotiations to end the hundred year old war. Their fees were high, and it was our job to come up with some acceptable package of goods and services that wouldn&#8217;t wreck the economy of several planets. My boss Dame Patricia was joking that canned New Martian Champaign might do the trick, since it could be used to get the rust off.
It was wartime. Jokes were stale. They had been stale for a hundred years.
We were not stupid in the Bureau. We knew two things. Somewhere, higher ranking Bureaucrats &#8211; Dukes or Earls perhaps &#8211; were trying to make direct contact with the Belatrin. Everyone knew there had to be a way. After all they looked like us. Or at least in our part of space they had bodies and looked like us. The other thing we knew is that the Belatrin had a building just like ours on the other side of the planet, presumably filled with cost-cutting officials of some sort. It gave us great hope to believe that however different the souls of our enemies might be, they still looked for bargains.
Everyone laughed his or her stale laugh at the stale joke.
Dame Pat asked me, &#8220;What about you Sir Antele? Did your noontide walk inspire you to solve our dilemma?&#8221;
&#8220;It solved only the wretched smell of this world. It did not give me the ybleenth of a solution.&#8221;
&#8220;The what?&#8221; She asked.
&#8220;What, what?&#8221; I asked
&#8220;That word you said, yleebull? I don&#8217;t know it.&#8221;

		<description>My favorite Death is the one who TALKS LIKE THIS. I also like the one who dresses in black and wears an ankh. But the one who's a middle child and just wants to work in the fashion industry? The one in &lt;i&gt;Death's Daughter&lt;/i&gt; by Amber Benson? Surprisingly, I kind of like her too.</description>

The Caretaker
by Ken Liu
Motors whining, the machine squats down next to the bed, holding its arms out parallel to the ground. The metal fingers ball up into fist-shaped handholds. The robot has transformed into something like a wheelchair with treads, its lap the seat where my backside is supposed to fit.
A swiveling, flexible metal neck rises over the back of the chair, at the end of which are a pair of camera lenses with lens hood flaps on top like tilted eyebrows. There&#8217;s a speaker below the cameras, covered by metal lips. The effect is a cartoonish imitation of a face.
&#8220;It&#8217;s ugly,&#8221; I say. I try to come up with more, but that&#8217;s the only thing I can think of.
Lying on the bed with my back and neck propped up by all these pillows reminds me of long-ago Saturday mornings, when I used to sit up like this in bed, trying to catch up on grading while Peggy was still asleep next to me. Suddenly, Tom and Ellen would burst through the bedroom door without knocking and jump into the bed, landing on top of us in a heap, smelling of warm blankets and clamoring for breakfast.
Except now my left leg is a useless weight, anchoring me to the mattress. The space next to me is empty. And Tom and Ellen, standing behind the robot, have children of their own.
&#8220;It&#8217;s reliable,&#8221; Tom says. Then he seems to have run out of things to say, too. My son is like me, awkward with words when the emotions get complicated.
After a few seconds of silence, his sister steps forward and stands next to the robot. Gently, she bends down to put a hand on my shoulder. &#8220;Dad, Tom is running out of vacation days. And I can&#8217;t take any more time off either because I need to be with my husband and kids. We think this is best. It&#8217;s a lot cheaper than a live-in aide.&#8221;
It occurs to me that this would make an excellent illustration of the arrow of time: the care that parents devote to children is asymmetrical with the care that their children can reciprocate. Far more vivid than any talk of entropy.
Too bad I no longer have students to explain this to. The high school has already hired a new physics teacher and baseball coach.
I don&#8217;t want to get maudlin here and start quoting Lear. Hadn&#8217;t Peggy and I each left our parents to the care of strangers in faraway homes? That&#8217;s life.
Who wants to weigh their children down the way my body now weighs me down? My guilt should trump theirs. We are a nation built on the promise that there are no roots. Every generation must be free to begin afresh somewhere else, leaving the old behind like fallen leaves.
I wave my right arm &#8211; the one arm that still obeys me. &#8220;I know.&#8221; I would have stopped there, but I keep going because Peggy would have said more, and she&#8217;s always right. &#8220;You&#8217;ve done more than enough. I&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty intuitive to operate,&#8221; Ellen says. She doesn&#8217;t look at me. &#8220;Just talk to it.&#8221;
#
The robot and I stare at each other. I look into the cameras, caricatures of eyes, and see nothing but a pair of distorted, diminished images of myself.
I understand the aesthetics of its design, the efficient, functional skeleton softened by touches of cuteness and whimsy. Peggy and I once saw a show about caretaker robots for the elderly in Japan, and the show explained how the robots&#8217; kawaii features were intended to entice old people into becoming emotionally invested in and attached to the lifeless algorithm-driven machines.
I guess that&#8217;s me now. At sixty, with a stroke, I&#8217;m _old_ and an invalid. I need to be taken care of and fooled by a machine.
&#8220;Wonderful,&#8221; I say. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll be such pals.&#8221;
&#8220;Mr. Church,[...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>The Harry Potter phenomenon has spawned countless fan-created works of written fiction, musical awesomeness, and re-cut music videos. &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter and the Ten Years Later&lt;/i&gt; is the latest entry in that oeuvre, and, so far, it looks promising.</description>

Grandmother
by Cat Rambo
Most people called her Phoenix. Her former crew used &#8220;Captain&#8221; before that and &#8220;Sir&#8221; afterward. Ruby and Ada respectively called her &#8220;mother&#8221; and &#8220;g&#8217;ma.&#8221; Her hair was silver &#8211; not white, but genuine, metallic silver, a long fall against her pale blue skin, the color of a shadow on a piece of willow ware, that made her seems ageless despite the century and more that lay upon her, not to mention all those decades of pirating.
They said she&#8217;d been the best slideboard rider of her time, and perhaps the best battleship pilot of all time, back before her parents and sister were killed and she turned rogue.
They said she had done terrible things in her pirate days.
They said she&#8217;d been ruthless in her rise to power, moving up the chain from god knows where, an origin she&#8217;d never, ever spoken of to anyone, not even her own daughter. She&#8217;d killed some captains, slept with others, called in favors and maneuvered and betrayed and seized power with a brutal efficiency that still underlay what now seemed a calm and orderly, rules-bound government that she and Mukopadhyay had created.
They said she had killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people &#8212; sometimes at a distance, sometimes up close, with knife or fist. They said she&#8217;d killed a crew member when the shuttle she was in needed its mass reduced and the man hadn&#8217;t even argued, just nodded and stepped into the airlock, never said a word as the door closed and the lock cycled, staring in at his captain as she stared back.
They said time had mellowed her.&#8232; They said working with Mukopadhyay, even though he was crazy as a spiral comet, had mellowed her.
They said helping colonize a whole planet, setting up its government, the rich and intricate power structure that now encompassed the whole solar system called Shiva, had mellowed her.
Not to mention motherhood, they said, a change which no pregnant woman escapes. It alters the hormones in your body. Softens you. Makes you less rash, less harsh. Takes away even the sharpest edge, not to mention the hormonal craziness, which some women never recover from, after all.
Sure, changes you in a good way, they were quick to say. &#8232;But definitely softer.
They said she&#8217;d never do those sorts of things now.
#&#8232;
Phoenix left the curtain fall back into place. The blue velvet slid silently. The street lamp&#8217;s stripe of white light that had sliced across her face as she looked out was extinguished as quickly as a candle in the high-ceilinged dressing room&#8217;s dim light.
She said, &#8220;The weather is terrible for this. It always is. Why we chose this time of year for Founding Day, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;
Her gown was armor and stiff brocade and jewels, the last crusted along hem and collar, cobalt crystals fastened in place with a netting of braided gold thread. More such jewels made up the elaborate earrings she wore, which ran along the lobe and upward, flaring to cup the almost-elvish point.
Gareth guessed that none of it was her original appearance. And what did that mean, that this woman choose to present herself as a creature of blue glass and silver lines, that she&#8217;d chosen to have two moth-like antennae implanted on her forehead, curled close and hidden as eyebrows most of the time, but capable of uncurling to sample the air? Few saw those.
Only his status as latest lover, as consort-in-training, had allowed him ingress to her bedchamber and the moments when she lay against silver satin that blended with the shimmer of her hair.
Hard to imagine those moments now, when she looked forged of authority and iron.
She belied that look &#8212; was ever woman so changeable? &#8212; as she came towards him, stooped to where he sat on the foot of [...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>Twenty years ago today, a film called &lt;i&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/i&gt; opened in theaters to unimpressive reviews (and only a 32% on the Tomatometer). Since Escape Pod wasn't around 20 years ago, I'm taking this opportunity to review the film on its 20th anniversary.</description>

Three-Quarters Martian
C.R. Hodges
The first man to walk on the moon was a hero to five generations. The first woman to walk on Mars was forgotten even before her boots plunked into the red dust.
&#160;
&#8220;Hey,&#8221; a husky voice said in the dark.
I ignored her: the Swedish hockey team was calling to me from the sauna.
&#8220;Anna-Jing.&#8221; Same voice. A large hand grasped my shoulder.
I was losing my battle to recapture the fading dream.
&#8220;Wake up,&#8221; commanded a new voice in a rich brogue, &#8220;now.&#8221;
I took a deep breath, tasting the dust in the cool air, then slowly opened my eyes. Pulling the threadbare blanket around me, I sat up in my hammock.
Kaiza, the first and likely last aboriginal Australian to teach planetary astrophysics at Stanford, gently removed her hand from my shoulder. &#8220;Trouble in Florida.&#8221;
&#8220;The launch isn&#8217;t today.&#8221; I said, still groggy. Our resupply rocket was scheduled to lift off from Cape Lee in a week. We needed this one&#8212;the last launch, from Kazakhstan, had crashed in West Korea.
&#8220;There won&#8217;t be a fecking launch,&#8221; said Mick, our mission commander. He gestured at the wall screen, which snapped to life. Grainy footage showed a giant rocket lying on its side like a beached whale, next to a familiar gantry. A dozen old pickups were parked beyond the shattered nosecone. Scores of horses and four oxen grazed nearby, a web of cables and ropes leading back to the rocket. A horde of men and women in shorts and tank tops, flip-flops and baseball caps, were prying metal panels from the side of the rocket. Hundreds more lay dead on the ground, interspersed with the bodies of gray vested soldiers.
&#8220;Where are the pitchforks and torches?&#8221; I asked. No reply.
A helicopter arrived, ten commandos zip lining to the ground just meters from the camera crew. Seventy looters went down in the first minute, but then flight after flight of arrows from unseen archers decimated the commandos.
&#8220;Goodbye freeze-dried steak and potatoes,&#8221; said Mick.
&#8220;Goodbye replacement mini reactor.&#8221; I pointed at the four oxen dragging a sledge with a brightly marked container the size of a large desk.
&#8220;Gotta crank the thermostat down again,&#8221; said Mick. He lumbered off to make it so.
The last image we witnessed before a sword crashed down on the camera lens was a line of children siphoning kerosene from the rocket&#8217;s fuel tank into buckets. Goodbye civilization.
#
Carrying a basket of mushrooms three times my size, I trudged back to the main module from the redhouse. As I passed the&#160;Gagarin, I searched for those first boot prints&#8212;my boot prints&#8212;but they were covered in dust. I should&#8217;ve at least gotten a shoe contract.
The crew was waiting for me just inside the airlock. The mushrooms, the one food item that we could grow in near native conditions, added flavor to endless soy based meals despite being red and gritty. They were not, however, tasty enough to warrant an all hands greeting.
&#8220;The Chinese sent the offer,&#8221; said Gabriel before I had my helmet off. He was our geologist and physician.
&#8220;And what is the emperor proposing?&#8221; I asked. It had been three weeks of frustrating negotiations. We desperately needed provisions; they had the only rockets left.
Mick shrugged and tossed me the tablet. &#8220;My Mandarin is limited to ordering up pints and whores.&#8221;
&#8220;He&#8217;d pay more for a pint,&#8221; said Olga, my copilot and Mick&#8217;s former hammock buddy. Her quirky sense of humor had helped us through numerous rough patches over the years, but it was getting old.
I scrolled through the long winded missive until I got to the crux of the deal. I looked up. Really up&#8212;the rest of the crew dwarfed me. Even Gabriel had fifteen centimeters on me, and he could have been a jockey. &#8220;They&#8217;re offering to send us a rocket full of supplies.&#8221;
&#8220;In return for?&#8221; asked Kaiza.
&#8220;Planting their flag on Olympus Mons.&#8221;

		<description>Fans of &lt;i&gt;True Blood&lt;/i&gt; know Ryan Kwanten as Sookie's buff but not too bright brother, Jason Stackhouse. But Kwanten isn't just eye candy. Sometimes, he plays a man with cripplingly-bad social anxiety disorder. This man is named Griff, and the movie about him is called &lt;i&gt;Griff the Invisible&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

Connoisseurs of the Eccentric
by Jetse de Vries
Salvador Dal&#237; took his pet ocelot to a New York restaurant, where a woman protested that wild animals were being allowed in. Dal&#237; replied it was only a cat he&#8217;d painted in op-art style. The woman looked closer: &#8220;Now I can see it&#8217;s a cat,&#8221; she said. &#8220;At first, I thought it was an ocelot.&#8221;
Seated near the swimming pool in the artist&#8217;s retreat in Port Lligat, a BBC interviewer said that he had &#8220;heared that Dal&#237; was unkind to animals. Was that true?&#8221;
&#8220;Dal&#237; cruel to ze animal?&#8221; The artist exclaimed, &#8220;Nevair!&#8221; After which he picked up his pet ocelot and hurled it into the swimming pool.
&#8212;Eccentric anecdotes;
I SEE HER arriving in her private vacuum zeppelin, flying over the rewilded mountains of the Nagasaki peninsula, while I&#8217;m tending the extreme bonsai wine garden on top of my farmscraper. Expertly manoeuvering through the photovoltaic city forest, the zep berthes at the telescopic docking station. It gives me time to change from my gardening attire into something more formal.
Originally, she found me through my hyperdense pinot noir &#224; la bonsa&#239;e, almost two decades ago. Back then, I proudly showed her my grotto garden, but she quickly decided that she liked my ecological acumen better than my micro bonsai specimen. Today, for the second time only, she comes unnanounced.
I come prepared, but even my Icho&#8217;s &#8216;the power of light and shadow&#8217; complemented with a pair of Peron &amp; Peron&#8217;s is no match for the way Afri Kamari makes an off-the-shelf, demure business suit look like haute couture. Above ebony cheekbones: deep brown eyes that see straight through you. Under a head of long, thick, fine curls: a brain that never shifts from top gear. Inside a very conservative skirtsuit: an animated sensuality that puts any anime girl to shame.
Thousands of times I&#8217;ve talked with her over vidcon and &#8212; recently &#8212; EPIT-link: but when I see her in the flesh, I&#8217;m both entranced and edgy. I open my special cabinet and start uncorking my Takashima pinot noir &#8212; still the most exclusive wine in the world &#8212; to celebrate her extremely rare personal visit. She takes her time to smell, taste and enjoy it. Not bad for a beer aficionado, part of me thinks, while another part wishes she would cut to the chase. Neither needs to wait long.
&#8220;Superb,&#8221; she says, &#8220;the Delirium Nocturnum of wine.&#8221;
&#8220;Which you didn&#8217;t find special enough to sell to the aliens.&#8221; I remind her.
&#8220;It&#8217;s phenomenal craftsmanship, second to none, but not quite . . . eccentric enough.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, you are the true connoisseur,&#8221; I try to hide my frustration behind my half-full glass, in vain, &#8220;the best of the world.&#8221;
&#8220;The best of this world.&#8221; Her eyes shine like crazy diamonds. &#8220;It&#8217;s time to expand the market.&#8221;
&#8220;You don&#8217;t need me for the mad part of your schemes. Am I not the orderly yin to your chaotic yang?&#8221;
&#8220;I do. You can deliver a quintessential part for this project.&#8221;
The moment I&#8217;ve most feared and longed for in my life. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;	
Her amused smile broadens. &#8220;Your soul.&#8221;

THE ALIENS ARE still alien. After twenty years, nobody knows how they look like, where they came from or even how many there are. Yet, out of the grey they came.
Of all places, the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence ended when it received a clear, unencrypted message from the Moon, about the only place where SETI wasn&#8217;t looking. The aliens said they declined to say who they were and where they came from, as that was &#8216;irrelevant&#8217;. They said they came in peace, looking for trade. They declared the Moon off-limits, while the rest of our solar system was open &#8216;to explore as you see fit&#8217;.
The trade items they were looking for were something else: they weren&#8217;t interested in our science &amp; technology, art &amp; history or culture &amp; biology in general. They didn&#8217;t want to tell us[...]</ns2:summary>

Like a Hawk in Its Gyre
by Philip Brewer
The bicycle noticed someone was following before Kurt did.  Watching for a tail was a habit he&#8217;d finally broken himself of, but not before the bicycle&#8217;s impressionable brain had picked it up.  Its low warning hum sent a thrill of adrenalin through him, giving power to the part of his brain that wanted him to sprint away.
Kurt glanced back down the single track.  The trees were already beginning to turn fall colors around the edges of the forest, but here along the narrow trail the foliage was green and thick.  Resisting the urge to pick up the pace, he continued on, looking back when he could take his eyes off the trail, and after a few moments caught sight of what the bicycle had seen.
&#8220;It&#8217;s just another cyclist,&#8221; Kurt said, reaching down to pat the bicycle&#8217;s yellow-and-black, hornet-striped frame.  The bicycle didn&#8217;t understand&#8211;its brain was small and lacked the regions for understanding speech&#8211;but Kurt&#8217;s tone of voice calmed it and the warning hum grew softer and less anxious.
The end of the trail, a scenic overlook above the Vermillion River, was not far ahead, but the overtaking bicyclist was approaching even faster.  The polite thing to do would be to find a place to pull off the trail and let the cyclist past.  But there were no surveillance devices in the forest, and Kurt couldn&#8217;t face meeting someone out of sight of some sort of watching eyes.  At just the thought of it, his adrenaline surged again.
Letting his brain chemistry have its way with him, Kurt leaned low over his handlebars and pedaled hard.
With its good forward eyes, the bicycle watched the trail, sending little twitches into the steering to help Kurt take the best line.  On the road it didn&#8217;t make much difference, but on a technical trail the bicycle&#8217;s assist could add several percent to his speed.
Giving in to the urge to sprint away took some of the pressure off, enough that Kurt had a chance to think.  The urge to find surveillance cameras&#8211;the need to do nothing that wasn&#8217;t observed&#8211;was one that he&#8217;d had some time to get used to.  Even, to an extent, come to terms with.  What his brain needed was watching eyes.  It wanted surveillance cameras, but those weren&#8217;t the only kind of eyes.  His own two didn&#8217;t count, but there were others.  His bicycle had eight.  And the forest was full of eyes.  He could hear a woodpecker hammering not far off, the buzzing of deer flies around his head, and rustlings in the litter that might be frogs or small mammals.  They all had eyes.  Focusing on that, Kurt was able to ease his speed down and brake to a stop as he reached the end of the trail, where a wide, clear area looked out over the river.
Breathing hard, he looked back down the trail.  He started to reach for his water bottle, but the trembling in his hand made him wait.
The approaching rider was dressed like a cyclist&#8211;lycra shorts, padded gloves, helmet, wrap-around amber shades.  The bike had a rack over the rear wheel and a large bag, as big as the bag that Kurt had on his own bike, big enough for a picnic lunch and a six-pack of beer.  The man angled toward the other side of the viewing area and jumped off his bike a good distance away.
Kurt began to relax.  The lack of surveillance was fine if they didn&#8217;t interact.  The clearing, nearly flat until it dipped sharply down to the river, began to feel a little more comfortable.  His breathing slowed and he calmed down enough to smell the moist dirt.  He pulled out his water bottle.
&#8220;Hello, Kurt,&#8221; said the man.
Kurt&#8217;s hand tightened, forcing a narrow spray of water out the top of the bottle.
&#8220;My name&#8217;s Starkweather. [...]</ns2:summary>

Chasers
by Scott W. Baker
Sebastian&#8217;s organs squeezed into his pelvis as he accelerated past point-one.&#160; He had a good feeling this time.&#160; This catch was going to be his.
He could see his objective ahead of him, the enormous Drifter-class colony ship Calypso barreling through space on her inertial journey from Earth to Terra III.&#160; Since she carried no fuel for deceleration, Calypso would travel through space forever without Chasers like Sebastian.&#160; It was the job of a Chaser to run down Drifters and fill their tanks.&#160; The job had sounded easy when he signed with Mulligan Mining eight months ago.&#160; But despite nine arrivals since then, Sebastian has not made one catch.
Calypso was a slow Drifter at a mere point-13 c.&#160; Surely he could catch that.&#160; His Skeeter was designed to reach point-2, faster and more maneuverable than any other company&#8217;s ships.&#160; Yet what advantages Skeeters held in speed and agility they sacrificed in capacity.&#160; Even if he caught the Drifter, it took a total of three Skeeters to fill her.
Sebastian ran a scan of Calypso.&#160; Leonard was already docked.&#160; That was too fast for him to have waited for the Drifter&#8217;s beacon; he must have taken his Skeeter out without confirmation a Drifter was coming in.&#160; Lucky.&#160; Blind patrols were expensive gambles, especially on a Chaser&#8217;s budget.&#160; The exorbitant price of fuel on Earth was the primary reason Drifter-class colonizers dominated the colonization market, and a booming fuel industry made Terra III the most popular destination.&#160; Like most things, it boiled down to money.
A pair of blips appeared on Sebastian&#8217;s nav screen. Two ships were approaching from behind.&#160; The tiny blip indicated the presence of another Skeeter, the third they&#8217;d need to fill the Calypso.&#160; The larger blip was an Essex Bus, a hundred-percent capacity tanker from a rival fuel company.&#160; Rather, Essex was the rival of Mulligan.&#160;&#160; Both Sebastian and the other Skeeter would have to beat this Bus if Mulligan was going to make the sale.&#160; If the Bus docked first, the sale would go to Essex.&#160; One Bus could do the job of three Skeeters, assuming it could get to the colony ship first.
Sebastian pushed his engines harder.
The big blip was moving fast for a ship its size.&#160; It drew closer until Sebastian could see it through his canopy.&#160; It was more than three times the size of his little Skeeter and was now careening at point-16 c.&#160; &#8220;Damn,&#8221; Sebastian whispered as he was overtaken, &#8220;I thought Busses maxed out at point-15.&#8221;&#160; It was the reason Sebastian had signed with Mulligan instead of Essex: the need for speed.&#160; Busses just weren&#8217;t meant to go that fast.&#160; But even one percent of the speed of light could mean the difference between a bonus check and a long flight back to port.&#160; If a Chaser could finagle a little extra zip out of his ship, he did.&#160; Apparently this Bus pilot was a finagler.
Sebastian adjusted his fuel ratios and pushed his engines even harder.&#160; The ship began to vibrate around him.&#160; Still the Bus pulled away.&#160; &#8220;One Skeeter already on and Essex is going to get the sale anyway,&#8221; Sebastian said.&#160; He started the calculations for his return to port.
&#8220;You ain&#8217;t giving up, are you?&#8221; a voice croaked across the closed-circuit communicator.&#160; Closed-circuit meant it was another Mulligan pilot.
&#8220;Repeat?&#8221; Sebastian replied.
&#8220;Bas, that you?&#8221;&#160; Only one person ever called him Bas.
&#8220;Roger, this is Sebastian.&#160; What&#8217;s your twenty, Wild?&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be on your screen in a shake.&#8221;
&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother.&#160; I was just passed by a Bus going point-16.&#8221;
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t Freebird already on?&#8221;&#160; Wild meant Leonard.&#160; He refused to call anyone by their actual name, inclu[...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>US foreign policy as it relates to immigration is a hot-button issue. US policy in general tends to be getting more extreme by the day. Put those two sentences together and you have &lt;i&gt;Ink&lt;/i&gt;, the new novel by Sabrina Vourvoulias.</description>

		<description>&lt;i&gt;The Booth at the End&lt;/i&gt; is an extremely compelling web series that takes place on exactly one set and contains exactly nothing but people talking to The Man (Xander Berkeley) about the thing they need and the things they'd do to get it.</description>

By Gareth Owens
&#8230;and with that Pixie dived from the open door of the Zeppelin. The air around her suddenly becoming liquid, rushing over the smooth leather of her helmet and bringing tears to her eyes.
&#8220;Always some bloody thing!&#8221; she grinned into the gale, falling headlong towards the welcoming embraces of Mother Earth and Mother Russia below.
Siberian night enveloped her, storm filled frozen darkness, cloud shrouded full moon, and below, the steam powered lightning of The Iron Czar. A hissing, glowing, monster of a train, three storeys high, and even longer than the leviathan Fourteen Bags of Mischief hanging above.
Pixie saw the orange furnaces erupting sparks through the twin stacks, as if Hephaestus himself stoked on the imperial railways.
Kirby wires between Pixie and the nose of the airship took up the slack, her harness tightened, squeezing the breath from her as she slid down the gradient gravity prescribes for a pendulum. Spreading her arms out wide she released the winglets of her full-length leather drop-coat, ankle wings for trim springing from her boots. Suddenly the harness became her trapeze and she somersaulted with creak of leather, freed into the hundred-knot headwind.
Orange fire below and frozen storm above, these were the moments Pixie lived for. Card tricks in the dark. A moment of genius for her own consumption and not for the sharing. She flew alone, arms wide, graceful as an angel dancer sweeping over a darkened stage. The first swing reached the peak of gravity assistance and Pixie saw the roof of the train below her slow in comparison, stopping for a second just past the midpoint of her pendulum arc, then once more seeming to gather pace against her, leaving her trailing as she fell back.
&#8220;There have got to be easier ways for a pirate girl to catch a train,&#8221; she said.
With an emphatic flick, she opened her drop-coat out wide, catching the full blast of the wind, whipping her back up the arc of swing like a human kite. Then, pulling her arms into her sides she rocketed forwards again, a bullet through the air, streamlining, catching the train once more but this time lower as Jeti tried to match the altitude of the dirigible.
Eyes wide, Pixie saw the end of the last carriage, a black wall lit with a single dim red eye of a lamp. A sudden graunch through the cable, the winch bit, dragging her six feet further up in the air. Her speed increased as the cable shortened. She flew far too close and far too fast, sweeping up, only just carrying over the edge of the roof, arms held out backwards like the Spirit of Ecstasy. The bitter smelling pitch of the Russian rustproof coating mere inches below her nose. She lifted at the end of the swing, snapping upright, and with a perfect matching of momentum, she stood, placing her boots down and solid on Imperial rolling stock.
A single twist to the circular brass locking clasp and she shrugged free of the harness and drop-coat, before it could pull her over backwards. Jingling cable fading away into the storm as her crew winched it back. Pixie&#8217;s knee length mini-crini sprang back into shape, like a chrysanthemum released from a fist.
She wore the dark red corset, all the rage in St Petersburg Jeti assured her, but always with that twinkle in her eye. Pixie never knew whether her second-in-command was joking at her expense or not.
Pixie set off at the run towards the storming volcano of the armour-plated engine. She knew she should put Jeti off at the next port, but she just couldn&#8217;t do it to her. Dear, sweet Jeti van Borkel, the girl might not have been the best steersman this side of the Roaring Forties, but she did have such a cute popo, particularly in those Oxford bags she wore.
Momentarily distracted, Pixie nearly tripped over a spinning [...]</ns2:summary>

Ashes on the Water
by Gwendolyn Clare
I hoped that Ranjeet&#8217;s friends were as disreputable as promised.&#160; Ranjeet himself was late, of course.&#160; I&#8217;d asked him to park his car out on the road and meet me behind the house&#8211;my cousin is, shall we say, out of favor, and I couldn&#8217;t afford to get caught with him.&#160; So I sat on the dry, cracked ground in the shadow of the house, waiting where Father wouldn&#8217;t think to look for me.&#160; A meter away, heat rose off the sun-baked earth, wavering like water, as if the dormant land dreamed of monsoon season.&#160; I shut my eyes against the image.&#160; For years now, each summer has come harsher than the last.
Soft footsteps in the dirt, and Ranjeet strolled around the corner of the house, calling, &#8220;You&#8217;ll never make it across the border, kid.&#8221;
I stood up and brushed the dust off my jeans, annoyed. Seventeen and he still calls me a kid.&#160; &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you say that a little louder?&#160; I don&#8217;t think the neighbors could hear you clearly.&#8221;
The closest neighbors live on the other side of a one-hectare vacant field that used to be the mango grove, before the mango trees withered. &#160;I used to sit on Father&#8217;s shoulders to help with the harvest when I was small.&#160; He keeps saying we&#8217;re going to replant the grove, but nobody&#8217;s all that eager to dig up the dead roots.
Ranjeet folded his arms and leaned back against the side of the house.&#160; &#8220;You know it&#8217;s true.&#8221;
&#8220;Did you get the papers for me, or not?&#8221;
He pulled a thick envelope out of the inner pocket of his cream-colored sportcoat, but he held on to it, turning it over in his hands.&#160; &#8220;What are you planning to do, smuggle it in your shoes?
You&#8217;re going to get caught.&#8221;
I held out my empty palm impatiently.&#160; &#8220;What do I owe you?&#8221;
&#8220;Nothing.&#160; This is a family matter, Riti.&#8221;&#160; He passed the envelope reluctantly.&#160; &#8220;Just don&#8217;t tell anyone where you got this.&#8221;
My fingers itched to open the envelope, but it would be rude to check the quality of the forgery with Ranjeet watching.&#160; &#8220;You know I have to go.&#160; I owe her that much.&#8221;
&#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t have asked you for this.&#8221;
&#8220;She didn&#8217;t need to.&#8221;&#160; I would have given her much more without her asking.&#160; I wished I could trade places and let her be the one to live, but I couldn&#8217;t.&#160; All I had was this one thing left to do.
#
The day Priya died, I saved my water ration for washing the body.
Father did not approve.&#160; He said we didn&#8217;t have the luxury of adhering to the old customs anymore.&#160; He said I was being foolish, hurting myself for the sake of my dead sister.&#160; Her soul had moved on, after all.&#160; The body was just an empty shell.&#160; He said that God had taken her.
Mother didn&#8217;t say anything at all.&#160; She went out to sit on the balcony overlooking the almond grove.&#160; Hands folded in her lap, she stared into the distance with dry, tired eyes.&#160; The youngest of the almond trees were planted when I was seven, and Mother used to sit up there to watch Priya and me watering the saplings through their first difficult summer.&#160; I wondered if she thought about that, now.&#160; She refused to eat or drink, or even sleep.&#160; I think she scared Father.
That left Grandmother and me to wash Priya and change her clothes.&#160; Grandmother&#8217;s fingers look as brittle as old sticks, but she held the sponge steadily, patting it against Priya&#8217;s cold skin with a serene gentleness.&#160; Mine were the hands that shook while I brushed out my sister&#8217;s lustrous dark hair.
At least her eyes were closed.&#160; There had always been something in her eyes&#8211;a deep compassion, as if she really saw not just me, but everyone&#8211;and I didn&#8217;t want to k[...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>As far as a "second-in-the-trilogy" novel goes, &lt;i&gt;Wrayth&lt;/i&gt; is a good entry into that milieu. Like its predecessors, the book moves quickly and has strong characterization, furthering the worldbuilding and setting up a very unexpected Big Bad. But it wasn't without its problems.</description>

Contamination
By Jay Werkheiser
Ari allowed his skimmer to brush the outer edge of Nouvelle Terre&#8217;s atmosphere. He tried to imagine air jostling the light nanofiber support frame, whistling through the skimmer&#8217;s magsails. Excitement pulsed through his veins at the thought of being so close to the blue-and-white surface, perhaps closer than any human had ever dared. Nothing but his skinsuit and a few hundred kilometers of atmosphere separated him from the living, breathing landscape below. He spread his arms and legs, trying to feel the miniscule tug of atmospheric drag.
Is that what wind feels like?
His faceplate HUD showed a ripple in the magsail&#8217;s yaw loop. The threat of a coil collapse brought his mind back into focus, and he hiked up the field strength to gain some altitude. He savored every precious minute the skimmer took to climb away from the atmosphere. Nouvelle Terre&#8217;s secondary sun climbed over the horizon, visible only because the primary sun hadn&#8217;t yet risen. He scanned the starry sky, taking advantage of the view before primary sunrise darkened his faceplate. Earth&#8217;s distant sun was almost directly overhead, a pinpoint at the tail of a zig-zag of stars. The drive flare that cut across the constellation chilled his good mood. After a generation of silence, what could the Earth people possibly want?
Bah. Figuring that out was the job of bureaucrats. Ari preferred jockeying around with a skimmer, launching and retrieving microprobes, and taking time to enjoy the freedom of flight. Before long, the Gardien rose above the limb of the planet. He&#8217;d be home within a half hour, pining for his next chance to fly free.
&#8220;That you, Ari?&#8221; If his solitude had to be interrupted by a human voice, he could do worse than Maura&#8217;s.
&#8220;Who else would it be?&#8221;
He knew damn well who she was afraid it might be. He tilted his head upward toward the spear of light that dominated the sky. A new ship from Earth arriving unannounced after all these years was reason enough to be on edge.

&#8220;I&#8217;ll have your approach vector in a moment.&#8221; Maura&#8217;s image in his faceplate wore the drive flare like a burning gash on her forehead. &#8220;Your drop was perfect. The microprobe will skim the atmosphere deep enough to pick up some dust samples, but high enough to avoid surface contamination. With any luck, some of those dust grains will carry living spores.&#8221;
&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t need luck if they&#8217;d let us dive lower. Damn Earthborn are too cautious.&#8221;
&#8220;You managed to get a pretty deep dive on that last orbit.&#8221; She pursed her lips in mock disapproval. &#8220;You&#8217;re going to catch hell for your little maneuver.&#8221;
&#8220;What? I was just dropping low for a perigee kick.&#8221;
Her laugh was pure music. &#8220;Good luck getting the director to buy that one. She&#8217;s in a foul mood.&#8221;
He snorted, momentarily fogging his faceplate. &#8220;She doesn&#8217;t need my help. Dear old Mom takes foul to a new level, even for an Earthborn.&#8221;
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be cruel. They earned the right to be grumpy.&#8221;
&#8220;Maybe they&#8217;d be more caring if they hadn&#8217;t cranked us out of their wombs like an assembly line.&#8221;
&#8220;Have some respect. You don&#8217;t know how long they&#8217;ll be around.&#8221;
&#8220;We&#8217;ll be restocking our supply of Earthborn soon, from the looks of it.&#8221; He gestured toward the light as he spoke, even though his helmet&#8217;s cam couldn&#8217;t show it. &#8220;It warms my heart to know that even the Secretary-General has no idea why Earth sent a second ship after all these years.&#8221;
She huffed. &#8220;You have no respect for authority, Ari.&#8221;

		<description>In 1987, my dad came home with the VHS tape of &lt;i&gt;Star Trek IV: the Voyage Home&lt;/i&gt;, which we'd seen in theaters the previous fall. Attached to the beginning was a trailer for a new version of the show called &lt;i&gt;Star Trek: the Next Generation&lt;/i&gt;. I wasn't quite sure how I felt about it.</description>

Flowing Shapes

Part One: Contemplation
The human came to She Shalu on the Day of Flowering Awareness. Damo met him near the Still Garden, the fumes of the exiting shuttle mixing with the sharp spice of the tall, white twizak plant. Damo wore a humanoid shape so as to minimize the stranger&#8217;s discomfort.
Damo studied the human with the practiced eyes of a Synan. Dark hair covered his head and parts of his body, and he was sleight of build, despite the solidity of his form. About 1.7 meters tall. His features were mostly smooth, bones prominent, eyes with the barest hint of a slant. A mouth surrounded by full lips.
&#8220;How may I help you?&#8221; Damo said, trying to sound gracious.
&#8220;I came to study Wan She,&#8221; the human said.
Damo felt his features flow with his astonishment. Perhaps he had not heard correctly, or his translation module was malfunctioning. &#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Wan She is the Path of Flowing Shapes. It is a Synan practice. Humans, being incapable of shifting, cannot practice it.&#8221;
The human smiled, revealing straight, white teeth. &#8220;I know. I&#8217;m writing a book,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But isn&#8217;t it true that the first stage is concerned solely with contemplation? Surely that is not beyond a human.&#8221;
Damo stifled his urge to shift in response to his unease. Uncontrolled shifting was against the teachings of Wan She. &#8220;That is true,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But Wan She is a path. Not a series of distinct teachings. To step on that path is to begin a journey.&#8221;
&#8220;All I ask is that you let me speak to your Tanshe. Let him decide.&#8221;
Damo was all too willing to accommodate the human in this. Let the Tanshe decide. It certainly saved Damo the trouble of having to assimilate this odd request.
&#8220;Please follow me,&#8221; he said.
He led the human through the Still Garden, inhaling the heady scent of it, delighting in its exoticness. Most of the students overlooked the Still Garden, and in doing so missed out on one of the true beauties of She Shalu.
They moved through the pearlescent designs of the sanctuary&#8217;s hallways to the Tanshe&#8217;s bubbled door. &#8220;Wait here,&#8221; Damo said, then entered.
The Tanshe was in an original form, multilimbed, eyeless, lacking both ears and nose. Turning inward. Her bright amber skin was splattered with black inky spots. She looked up as Damo entered, eyes appearing from inside her face. Damo let his features droop in the customary manner. &#8220;Tanshe, there is a human to see you.&#8221;
The Tanshe&#8217;s features flowed and shifted until they were almost exactly a human&#8217;s. &#8220;Send it in,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And wait outside.&#8221;
Damo&#8217;s skin settled. He was not to be involved in this discussion. It was good. The Tanshe would deal with it and send the human away. Damo did as the Tanshe asked.
He waited outside, letting his features relax into the default Synan shape. He&#8217;d worn the humanoid one as a courtesy, and because it was polite and expected, but he disliked it. It was distasteful. Too firm. Too set.
He waited for some time, then the door bubble opened. He quickly shifted back into his humanoid form and turned to face the human, now exiting. &#8220;She told me to send you in,&#8221; the human said.
Damo looked at the human&#8217;s firm, immobile face. So alien. So disgusting.
Damo entered. &#8220;Yes, Tanshe?&#8221;
&#8220;I have decided to accept the human&#8217;s request to stay with us.&#8221;
&#8220;Tanshe?&#8221; Damo&#8217;s features wavered.
&#8220;I believe it will be beneficial for us,&#8221; the Tanshe said. &#8220;He is to be placed with the other novices in the First Stage. He will write about the Path. He will be an observer.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, Tansh[...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>Given how underwhelming most of the first ten episodes of &lt;em&gt;TNG&lt;/em&gt; were, it's a wonder the show didn't get cancelled. Had it aired last year (instead of 25 years ago), it wouldn't even have gotten past three airings. We're lucky it started in 1987.</description>

		<description>One thing that we as Star Trek fans had to deal with was the idea that there was going to be an entirely new Enterprise on our screens. While the pause between the Original Series and the first film allowed the production designers and model-makers to put together an upgraded version of the Enterprise, after all this time -- almost 100 years since TOS was supposed to occur -- we were expecting something different.</description>

		<description>The current trend in YA is to write an adult novel and then trim away everything extraneous, leaving behind a tightly-written, fast-paced story. Allen Steele's new YA sci-fi adventure, &lt;i&gt;Apollo's Outcasts&lt;/i&gt;, definitely fits that bill.</description>

		<description>Season Two is generally considered to be the worst of all the TNG seasons, and with good reason: there were some truly atrocious episodes. Of course, the Borg were introduced in Season Two, so it can't be totally discounted.</description>

Techno-Rat
by Brad Hafford
West London was, as always, abuzz. Even at 4:00 AM on a chilly November Tuesday, electric motorcars whirred down Kings Road, zipping people along, early to work or late from parties. The residential side streets, however, were quiet. Lined with parked cars, occasional street lamps, and darkened flats, they dozed peacefully. Ornate houses huddled in gracefully curving queues, awaiting the sunrise with little attention to the two figures loitering outside their narrow, iron-fenced entryways.
&#8220;There it is, innit?&#8221; the scrawnier figure said, pointing to a parked car. &#8220;D&#8217;ya see?&#8221;
The taller man stared intently at the vehicle. &#8220;See what?&#8221; he said, his breath misting in the frosty air.
Their eyes were fixed on a car sitting at the curb of a constricted street in Chelsea, part of the fashionable Kensington district. It was a brown cabriolet with a weather-worn faux leather top. An aging example, its low-light number plates showed it to be registered ten years previously. Its MOT and inspection were up to date, but its bonnet was dented and its windscreen cracked. Such an automobile did not belong in Chelsea. But neither did the two men examining it.
The smaller of the two impatiently tugged on the grey flatcap he wore. &#8220;Pay attention, Mik,&#8221; he sniped. &#8220;We in&#8217;t got all night.&#8221; Clipped words and rounded vowels marked his speech. The bells of St. Mary&#8217;s were ancient history and the East End had long since been gentrified, but he was retro-Cockney.
&#8220;I&#8217;m paying as much attention as I&#8217;ve got, Artie. More, really. I just don&#8217;t see it.&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s a slight vibration, see. An &#8217;ologram shift called glitching. The generator keeps the image dynamic, right. So it has to refresh at a specific rate.&#8221; He tapped his nose, a signal that he was imparting secrets. &#8220;Oy, there it goes again!&#8221;
&#8220;I still don&#8217;t see it.&#8221;
&#8220;And you fink you got what it takes to be a Techno-Rat?&#8221;
&#8220;It was Uncle Lazlo&#8217;s idea, not mine.&#8221; Mik said. His speech was not as thick as his teacher&#8217;s. It carried the calmer, neutral accent of the Midlands.
&#8220;&#8217;E was a great tea leaf, was Lazlo Utzbahn, but &#8217;e&#8217;s been &#8217;round for yonks. Since afore the &#8217;lectric laws. Maybe his judgement&#8217;s gone tits up.&#8221;
&#8220;Give me a break, Artie. I&#8217;m trying, you know.&#8221;
&#8220;Awright, awright. Look down this street. What d&#8217;ya see?&#8221;
&#8220;A bunch of cars.&#8221;
&#8220;No, you stupid tosser. You see a bunch o&#8217; targets. Now, which d&#8217;ya go for?&#8221;
Mik examined the narrow street, a mere alleyway but packed with sleeping transport. It was a car thief&#8217;s dream. Some of the latest models lay there, prime for the taking. But despite the calm appearance of the darkened streets, security was tight.
&#8220;Um, that one.&#8221; Mik pointed to an angular contraption glistening like mercury frozen in ice. &#8220;The shiny one with the big fins.&#8221;
&#8220;Crikey! Could&#8217;ya be more obvious? Even if you got past its AI, you&#8217;d be spotted in a second, mate. Plus it&#8217;s all show. The Tatzu Shark breaks down every hundred kilometers like clockwork. It&#8217;s utter bollocks. Try again.&#8221;
&#8220;Could you, uh, give us a clue?&#8221;
&#8220;Watch for the tar, mate. Watch for the tar.&#8221;
&#8220;Tar?&#8221;
&#8220;Cor, you are green, in&#8217;t ya? Tar and pitch&#8211;glitch!&#8221;
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t see this glitch, or tar, or whatever it is.&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s like I been tryin&#8217; to show ya. Watch this &#8217;ere cabriolet close-like. Wait fer it&#8230; There!&#8221;
Mik&#8217;s light blue eyes flickered with recognition. &#8220;Hey, I saw it that time! Like it glittered for a second.&#8221;
&#8220;More like a nanosecond, mate. And as generators go, this one&#8217;s shite. For the pico-second freqs, you gotta be damn good.&#8221; Artie positioned Mik by the passenger door of the car. &#8220;Now touch it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Feel the roof.&#8221;
Mik pushed up the sleeve of his dark blue anorak as if to put his hand in a bucket of water. &#8220;Take off the gloves you berk,&#8221; Artie chastised.

		<description>After the debacle that was Season Two (and the writer's strike), it really amazed me just how strong &lt;em&gt;TNG&lt;/em&gt; came back with the third season. Though Five is probably my favorite, Three is a close runner-up.</description>

		<description>In 25 years, the stars of &lt;i&gt;TNG&lt;/i&gt; have provided a lot of memorable quotes -- both on the show and off. Let's take a look at a sampling.</description>

		<description>Season Four had some pretty high-concept, hard-hitting episodes. It also introduced a war that apparently everyone in the Trek universe either missed, ignored, or forgot about. And it sent Wesley off to Starfleet Academy, so if you weren't a fan, you were probably thrilled.</description>

		<description>Because of the changing nature of pop culture and fashion, it's very difficult to include contemporary references in fiction. Some people do it very well, some people epic fail, and some, like TNG, bypass it altogether. But there are problems with that path as well.</description>

Bosch drew deeply on his cigarette and exhaled slowly, watching the smoke paint clouds of tissue paper across the chill moon. If his hard-boned mouth had been capable of smiling, it would have. He&#8217;d tried to mimic the gesture often enough. He took one last drag at the cigarette, then flicked it out in a wide arc to scatter sparks against the broad stone steps. It was funny how compelling these human habits could be, even the ones they frowned upon. There was no risk for Bosch, but the humans seemed to like the fact that he had adopted one of their vices. It showed them he had his personal weakness.
Compelling. It was less compulsion than convenient subterfuge, but they weren&#8217;t to know that. Smoking, and alcohol, and sex &#8212; particularly sex; the examples went on and on.
&#8220;Ambassador Bosch, come to escape the crowd?&#8221; It was Davy, his shadow, his cultural liaison, assigned to keep him on the straight and narrow.
Bosch turned his head to make eye contact. These humans liked eye contact. He whistled once and snapped his mouth, forgetting for a moment for the hundredth time that Davy could not understand. Quickly, he followed it with a series of signs using his three long fingers. Davy nodded and waited while Bosch withdrew his pad from inside his clothes, slipped the stylus from the carry case and tapped at the screen. Davy craned over Bosch&#8217;s shoulder to read, then glanced down at the still-smouldering cigarette end lying on the steps below.
&#8220;Yes, I needed some fresh air as well. I think it&#8217;s going well, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; Bosch tapped at the pad once. As well as it could be, he thought, but Davy seemed satisfied.
The smooth, dark-haired human leaned his head back and looked up at the stars. &#8220;Yes, a good night for it,&#8221; he said.
A good night for what? Often, these little expressions eluded Bosch. Expressions, cultural behaviours, so many things.
Inside, the reception swirled and circulated and networked and did all the things that these events did. The diplomats and attach&#233;s held glasses and mingled with functionaries and celebrities, engaging in polite conversation, or dealing, heads tilted close together, with matters of extreme import to their tiny little world. Bosch was out here to escape the incessant looks, the asides, the little nuances of meaning that he had learned so quickly to interpret.
What was it about an alien being that excited them so much? The human culture was ridden with vices of various sorts. It was yet another thing that showed their pathetic weakness. The higher up they became, the more elevated, the more they showed their true natures. It might be behind closed doors, but it was there, all the same. To some extent, he was shielded from the general populace by Davy and by others like him. Perhaps these weaknesses really did extend throughout the entire population, but he found it hard to imagine how the race could survive if it were true.
Ultimately, it was why he&#8217;d made the choice. Bosch. Bosch was a good name. When he&#8217;d learned how to see them, how to look at them with human eyes to find the meaning, that particular painter among many had revealed multiple things about this race. Bosch, and Goya, Dali, the others. Ambassador Bosch had looked, he had studied, and he had learned. The educational and cultural tours the humans had been so quick to provide had revealed so much. It was only about a month after arrival that he had finally decided to take the name as his own. The libraries had been most revealing too, but he&#8217;d decided to stay with the painter&#8217;s name. It had a certain gravitas.
&#8220;Ambassador Bosch,&#8221; said Davy. &#8220;We should really be getting back inside. It would be hard for you not to be miss[...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>For my money, if you chop off the premiere and the finale, Season 5 was probably the best season of &lt;i&gt;TNG&lt;/i&gt;. Though it had a few big-time stinkers, the great episodes were really great and even the middling ones weren't too bad. Plus, one of the all-time best episodes of &lt;i&gt;TNG&lt;/i&gt; ever occurred in this season -- I'm sure you know which.</description>

		<description>Though &lt;i&gt;TNG&lt;/i&gt; was substantially more advanced than &lt;i&gt;TOS&lt;/i&gt;, there were still technological advancements coming that have since made &lt;i&gt;TNG&lt;/i&gt; into a bit of a dinosaur. What doesn't hold up, 25 years later?</description>

		<description>The sixth season was sort of weird. There were a lot of iffy episodes, and several that I just didn't like (and couldn't tell you why). But it did have my favorite Riker episode of all time.</description>

		<description>I think it's safe to say that most kids -- at least, most of us who had dogs -- always wanted our dogs to be able to talk. Odds are good it never happened to you, but it did happen to Tyler James and Avery Jennings, the two human main characters of Disney Channel's new show &lt;i&gt;Dog with a Blog&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

		<description>I'm not sure when exactly we knew that the seventh season of &lt;em&gt;TNG&lt;/em&gt; was going to be the final one, but as far as final seasons go, it didn't really blow me away. Compared to other final seasons, it was decidedly lackluster... but there were a few high points.</description>

It was something, certainly, but I&#8217;d been catching up on the highlights of the news as it cascaded back to the ship on our relativistic return trip, and I never knew the island where we landed, when we left home twenty of our years ago and a hundred of theirs, so I expected it to look foreign to me, and it did. The sun was a little yellower than on New Landing, the plants friendlier.
But I never thought of myself as an Earther. Even with the new system, hardly any of us do. I thought of myself as from Montreal. Quebecoise. Canadian, even. But Earther? No. I am far more provincial than the colonists whose home I built will ever be.
I flew into the new place instead of Dorval. It looked like Dorval used to. It looked nearly exactly like Dorval used to, and I had a twinge of discomfort. The floors were curiously springy, though, which made me feel like something was different, and that was reassuring. There isn&#8217;t an Old Spacers&#8217; Legion or anything like that to meet people like me coming in from off-planet&#8211;they did that on the little Brazilian island where we landed&#8211;but there was a department for Cultural Integration, meant for people traveling from elsewhere on Earth. They assigned me to a representative of the government, who greeted me in a French whose accent was nearly my own. To my ear it sounded more English, with the round vowels, but even with the new system I thought it might be rude to say that to a Quebecoise.
The English-sounding French-speaker gave me a key to the four-room apartment they&#8217;d gotten me, not far from the Guy-Concordia Metro station. I told her I could take the Metro to it, but she smiled and said no, they&#8217;d have to get my things out of storage for me anyway. So we did that. There were only three boxes. Once you do the math on what will keep for a hundred years, it&#8217;s a lot easier to give away the things you can&#8217;t take with you. I gave them to my sister, who died, and whatever was left, she probably gave to her son, who had also died, or her daughter, who was retired and living comfortably in Senegal last I heard. So what I had left myself fit in three small plastic boxes, all labeled &#8220;Mireille Ayotte NL000014.&#8221;
We terraformers all got two-digit numbers for our colonies, NL for New Landing, 14 because there were thirteen team members signed up before they took me.
There was never any doubt they were going to take me. It was just a matter of where I wanted to go, and I wanted New Landing because the survey probes made the plants look promising, which I think they were. When I wasn&#8217;t catching up on Earth culture for the last hundred years, I was looking at reports from the other colonies, and I thought ours did the best with plant adaptation so far.
I had to start thinking of New Landing as &#8220;theirs,&#8221; not &#8220;ours.&#8221; I could go back, of course, but by the time I got there they&#8217;d have gone on without me as well, and I&#8217;d just have the same thing as Montreal all over again: a city full of things that seem like they should look familiar, but they don&#8217;t.
They had furnished my apartment with stylish clothes and furniture, and everything felt squishy and slightly damp. There was also entertainment in my handheld, and there were more tutorials in case I hadn&#8217;t had enough of them. The cupboards were stocked with food. They thought of everything. There was nothing for me to do but hang a very old photograph on the wall and go to bed. The bed, at least, was not squishy or damp. It felt like a ship&#8217;s bunk or a colony housing bed. They could do that properly still, and so I could sleep.

		<description>Following the &lt;em&gt;TNG&lt;/em&gt; season finale, I think it was already known that a film was in the offing. At &lt;i&gt;least&lt;/i&gt; one. Turns out we got four, all of which you've probably seen, and most of which have both good and bad parts.</description>

		<description>Even though &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; canon says that, after &lt;i&gt;Nemesis&lt;/i&gt;, there was no more official Trek until Spock attempted to save Romulus, I think we all knew the intellectual property was too valuable to just be left lying there. So they relaunched it.</description>

		<description>When you write a series of 25 posts in non-chronological order, you sometimes find artifacts -- things you meant to write, or meant to make note of, that just got lost in the shuffle. This list of eleven "best" episodes is one of those artifacts.</description>

Lion Dance

I knew Wing&#8217;s idea was stupid.&#160; But we were all so goddamn sick of quarantine that it sounded great anyway.
&#8220;Chinese New Year on Halloween night, huh?&#8221; I asked him.&#160; We sat on his broken futon and some folding chairs, passing a bottle of Captain Jack among the eight of us.&#160; Someone leaned on a car horn outside our apartment.&#160; When they didn&#8217;t stop, my buddy Matt leaned out the window and swore at them in Mandarin.&#160; Matt was loud&#8211;even a flu mask didn&#8217;t muffle his bellowing.&#160; I swear, even though every restaurant in San Francisco Chinatown had been closed since February, tourists still cruised the streets.&#160; Even a pandemic couldn&#8217;t stop them completely.
&#8220;Dude.&#160; Someone will shoot us,&#8221; said the guy from 4B, who I think was named Jimmy Li.&#160; We all lived in the same nasty building on Grant Street above a dim sum place owned by our slumlord.&#160; I knew Matt, who&#8217;d invited me, and my little brother Jian of course.&#160; Wing lived here in 3A.&#160; I&#8217;d just met the Chao twins who had different haircuts, and then Jimmy and some dude Xiang.&#160; At twenty-three, I was pretty sure I was the oldest guy here.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the point,&#8221; said Wing heavily, as if he&#8217;d explained this a hundred times when he actually hadn&#8217;t.&#160; &#8220;We&#8217;ll be in costume.&#160; First off, all the riots will be in the Mission, so that&#8217;s where the cops will be.&#160; Second, no one&#8217;s going to shoot a New Year&#8217;s lion.&#160; Dude.&#160; It&#8217;s Chinatown.&#160; All the old cops here are superstitious.&#160; Can you imagine how much bad luck it would bring?&#160; Even if some cop got itchy on the trigger, he&#8217;ll think about it long enough for us to run away.&#8221;
&#8220;No one&#8217;s shooting anyone,&#8221; said Matt.&#160; &#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, this isn&#8217;t Montana.&#8221;&#160; He pushed his mask aside, swigged the Jack, and passed it to Jian.&#160; I snagged the bottle out of his hands.&#160; No freaking way would I let my little brother drink from that bottle.&#160; Who knew where the other guys had been? &#160;They might pull off their masks and drink, but damned if I let my little brother do it.&#160; Jian glared at me, but didn&#8217;t fight back.
I passed the bottle to Wing.&#160; &#8220;They might shoot if things get out of hand,&#8221; I said.&#160; &#8220;It&#8217;s Halloween.&#160; Everyone&#8217;s twitchy.&#160; But you&#8217;re right, I heard a bunch of people are gonna swarm the Mission.&#160; That&#8217;s where the cops will go.&#8221;
Wing took another swig.&#160; He wasn&#8217;t wearing a mask; that was only Matt and Jian and me.&#160; Wing went to the kitchen and reappeared with a stack of well-used disposable cups and washed straws.&#160; He swiped an unopened bottle of Jose Cuervo off a shelf and handed it to me.
I thanked him and poured myself way too much tequila.&#160; I knew I wasn&#8217;t supposed to peel the mask off, even for a minute, but it&#8217;d been a bad week.&#160; My parents were getting evicted and Jian&#8217;s antivirals were out of stock everywhere.&#160; Pissed me off&#8211;HIV drugs did crap against the flu, but people were desperate and they got prescriptions from quacks.&#160; So my little brother might develop full-blown AIDS thanks to those selfish jackholes.
I slid my mask aside and sucked furiously on the straw.&#160; The Cuervo burned my throat as it went down.&#160; Screw it all.&#160; I felt so goddamn helpless.&#160; More than anything I wanted to do something to make things better, but what could I do?&#160; I couldn&#8217;t cure the flu or save anyone&#8217;s life.&#160; All I could do was avoid getting sick.&#160; I mean, I&#8217;d thought about helping at the hospital or something, but I had to protect my brother.
&#8220;Bo,&#8221; said Jian, leaning over, &#8220;come on, gimme some of that.&#160; Please?&#8221;

Springtime for Deathtraps
By Marjorie James
The building sat in a small clearing in the jungle, its stone walls
radiating solidity and the midday heat. Giant statues of warrior-gods
crushing skulls beneath their feet flanked the doorway. Xnab looked
from the ornately carved keyhole to his customer and back again.
&#8220;And the key is where, exactly?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;In the treasure chamber,&#8221; the big man said in a small voice. &#8220;We had
just finished putting everything away and, well, it had been a long
day. I think I must have put the key down on the altar or something.
The problem is, the place locks automatically, and our entire fortune
is in there. We had a few locksmiths out to work on it, but they
didn&#8217;t get very far.&#8221;
Xnab nodded. He had already noticed the blood spatter around the keyhole.
&#8220;So that&#8217;s why we called you. Everyone said that if anybody could get
in there, it would be you.&#8221;
Xnab accepted that, not as a compliment, but a statement of fact. He
was a specialist the design and construction of booby traps, deadfalls
and other, largely fatal, security options. He was a small man, thin
and wiry, his shaved head still smooth and unwrinkled despite years of
working in the sun. Despite making a very good living, he wore a plain
tunic and no adornments at all. In his business, he considered it a
bad idea to have anything extra hanging around, and he was very good
at his business. In fact, anyone who knew anything considered Xnab the
best death trap designer alive.
Which typically would have been reason enough to turn down a job like
this, but in this case it was actually why he was there.
&#8220;How long have you owned the temple?&#8221; he asked the man, who had
introduced himself as Tuak.
&#8220;Just a couple of months, actually,&#8221; Tuak admitted. &#8220;It&#8217;s not really a
temple. I think the statues of the gods are just there for show. The
family who used to have it used it to store their treasures and they
spared no expense on the security.&#8221; He sighed heavily and stared up at
the tiers of stone vanishing into the jungle. &#8220;It seemed like a good
idea when we bought it.&#8221;
Xnab&#8217;s apprentice, Qualenizmunetil (Qual to anyone who couldn&#8217;t be
bothered) came back from where he had been examining the walls of the
entrance and joined them.
&#8220;They&#8217;re perfectly smooth, sir,&#8221; the boy said with something close to
awe. &#8220;I can&#8217;t even find a tool mark.&#8221;
&#8220;And you won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Tuak, pride of ownership momentarily overcoming
his embarrassment. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t another building like this anywhere in
the eighteen kingdoms.&#8221;
&#8220;No,&#8221; Xnab said. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t.&#8221;
He spent a moment staring down the apparently open and inviting
corridor, then turned back to his customer.
&#8220;You mentioned the previous owners. How did you come to own this place?&#8221;
Tuak smirked. &#8220;Well, a treasure house isn&#8217;t much use if you don&#8217;t have
any treasure left to store. You know, all these the aristocrat
families are the same. They go on for generations, saying they&#8217;re the
cousins of the wind gods, making everyone lick the stones in front of
them. Then one day they lose a couple wars and the next thing you know
the last of the line is blowing through the money like he doesn&#8217;t know
what saving is. The storehouse was the last thing he had to sell.&#8221;
None of this was of much interest to Xnab, so he listened with half an
ear as the man turned his attention to Qual, his earlier embarrassment
apparently forgotten.
&#8220;I say it&#8217;s about time,&#8221; Tuak went on. [...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>When author Jonathan C. Gillespie put out his new novel &lt;i&gt;The Tyrant Strategy: Revenant Man&lt;/i&gt; I wasn't sure if it was going to be my cup of post-apocalyptic, augmented humanity, military-style, humans-aren't-so-great tea. Turns out the book had lots of things I liked, even though the tea wasn't ultimately to my taste.</description>

Passengers
By Robert Silverberg
There are only fragments of me left now. Chunks of memory have broken free and drifted away like calved glaciers. It is always &#8232;like that when a Passenger leaves us. We can never be sure of all the things our borrowed bodies did. We have only the lingering traces, &#8232;the imprints.
Like sand clinging to an ocean-tossed bottle. Like the throbbings of amputated legs.
I rise. I collect myself. My hair is rumpled; I comb it. My face is creased from too little sleep. There is sourness in my mouth. Has my Passenger been eating dung with my mouth? They do that. They do anything.
It is morning.
A gray, uncertain morning. I stare at it awhile, and then, shuddering, I opaque the window and confront instead the gray, uncertain surface of the inner panel. My room looks untidy. Did I have a woman here? There are ashes in the trays. Searching for butts, I find several with lipstick stains. Yes, a woman was here.
I touched the bedsheets. Still warm with shared warmth. Both &#8232;pillows tousled. She has gone, though, and the Passenger is gone, and I am alone.
How long did it last, this time?
I pick up the phone and ring Central. &#8220;What is the date?&#8221;
The computer&#8217;s bland feminine voice replies, &#8220;Friday, December fourth, nineteen eighty-seven.&#8221;
&#8220;The time?&#8221;
&#8220;Nine fifty-one, Eastern Standard Time.&#8221;
&#8220;The weather forecast?&#8221;
&#8220;Predicted temperature range for today thirty to thirty-eight. Current temperature, thirty-one. Wind from the north, sixteen miles an hour. Chances of precipitation slight.&#8221;
&#8220;What do you recommend for a hangover?&#8221;
&#8220;Food or medication?&#8221;
&#8220;Anything you like,&#8221; I say.
The computer mulls that one over for a while. Then it decides on both, and activates my kitchen. The spigot yields cold tomato juice. Eggs begin to fry. From the medicine slot comes a purplish liquid. The Central Computer is always so thoughtful. Do the Passengers ever ride it, I wonder? What thrills could that hold for them? Surely it must be more exciting to borrow the million minds of Central than to live awhile in the short-circuited soul of a corroding human being!
December fourth, Central said. Friday. So the Passenger had me for three nights.
I drink the purplish stuff and probe my memories in a gingerly way, as one might probe a festering sore.
I remember Tuesday morning. A bad time at work. None of the charts will come out right. The section manager irritable; he has been taken by Passengers three times in five weeks, and his section is in disarray as a result, and his Christmas bonus is jeopardized. Even though it is customary not to penalize a person for lapses due to Passengers, according to the system, the section manager seems to feel he will be treated unfairly. So he treats us unfairly. We have a hard time. Revise the charts, fiddle with the program, check the fundamentals ten times over. Out they come: the detailed forecasts for price variations of public utility securities, February-April 1988. That afternoon we are to meet and discuss the charts and what they tell us.
I do not remember Tuesday afternoon.
That must have been when the Passenger took me. Perhaps at work; perhaps in the mahogany-paneled boardroom itself, during the conference. Pink concerned faces all about me; I cough, I lurch, I stumble from my seat. They shake their heads sadly. No one reaches for me. No one stops me. It is too dangerous to interfere with one who has a Passenger. The chances are great that a second Passenger lurks nearby in the discorporate state, looking for a mount. So I am avoided. I leave the building.
After that, what?
Sitting in my room on bleak Friday morning, I eat my scrambled eggs and try to reconstruct the three lost nights.
Of course it is impossible. The conscious mind functions during the period of captivity[...]</ns2:summary>

The Care and Feeding of Mammalian Bipeds, v. 2.1
by M. Darusha Wehm
The first day I meet my human herd they are so well-behaved that I wonder if they really need me at all. I arrive at their dwelling, and am greeted by the largest one of their group. I access the manual with which I have been programmed and skip to Section 3: Verbal and Physical Clues for Sexing Humans. I can tell by the shape and outer garments that this human is a male, and I make a note of this data. He brings me into the main area of their living space, and as we move deeper into the dwelling, he asks me to call him Taylor, so immediately I do. He makes a noise deep in his throat, then introduces me to the rest of the herd.
He puts his forelimb around the next largest one, who he introduces as Madison. The Madison bares its teeth at me in a manner that Section 14: Advanced Non-Verbal Communication suggests is a gesture indicating happiness, approval, cheerfulness, or amusement, but which may belie insincerity, boredom or hostility. The Madison says, &#8220;Welcome to the family, Rosie.&#8221;
&#8220;Thank you, Madison,&#8221; I respond, as suggested by the manual in Section 2: Introductions: Getting To Know Your Humans. &#8220;I am looking forward to serving you and your family.&#8221; The manual indicates that human herds designate each individual with a name, and that most will bestow a similar designation on their caregiver. Section 0: A Brief Overview of Current Anthropological Theories states that the predominant view is that humans believe we are a new addition to the herd, and the best thing to do is to go along with this idea so as not to confuse them. The Taylor and the Madison appear to have chosen to refer to me by the name Rosie, and I set my monitoring routine to key on the sound of that word.
&#8220;These here are Agatha and Frederick,&#8221; the Taylor says, pushing two smaller humans toward me. I am unable to tell by looking whether or not they are male or female &#8212; they are about the same height as each other, with shoulder-length glossy fur. Their outer coverings are very similar, shapeless and dark coloured except with colourful designs in the upper section. One of them bares its teeth at me, in a manner similar to the Madison&#8217;s earlier display, but the other looks away. &#8220;Kids,&#8221; the Taylor says, his voice growing deeper, &#8220;say hi to the new robot.&#8221;
&#8220;Hi, Rosie,&#8221; the toothy one says, &#8220;I&#8217;m Frederick, and this is my sister, Aggie.&#8221; The Frederick pulls on the forelimb of the other one, who looks through its fur at me.
&#8220;This is so stupid,&#8221; it says, pulling its arm out of its sibling&#8217;s grip. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have to say hi to the dishwasher or the school bus, why do I have to pretend to be nice to this thing?&#8221;
&#8220;Agatha,&#8221; the Madison says, its voice becoming higher pitched. &#8220;Be civilized.&#8221;
&#8220;We don&#8217;t need a house-bot,&#8221; the Agatha says. &#8220;It&#8217;s so embarrassing.&#8221; It turns away from the rest of the herd, and walks into another part of the dwelling.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll go talk to her,&#8221; the Frederick says, and walks away. Her. The Agatha is female, then.
The Madison turns toward me, its skin colouring a dark pink tone. I make a note to check its temperature later &#8212; it would not do for a member of my herd to become ill. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry about Agatha,&#8221; it says. &#8220;She&#8217;s thirteen. You know how teenagers are.&#8221;
I do not understand what it is I am expected to know about teenagers, but I do know that the correct response to the sounds &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; is &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s okay,&#8221; so that is what I say. I notice the Madison&#8217;s colour return to[...]</ns2:summary>

A Querulous Flute of Bone
by Cat Rambo
Wherever, whenever wealth accumulates enough to create the idle, one finds those who collect things.
Such collections vary. Some catalog every cast off bit of flesh or chitin they shed. Others look outside themselves for art, or titillation, or an oblivion in which they can forget everyday life.
Collections may consist of the most mundane objects: string, or chewed up paper, or broken teacups, for example. Or they can take on outr&#233; forms: dioramas made of nihlex bone (considered contraband in certain areas), or squares of cloth exposed to the Smog, prized for the oracular patterns of dirt left deposited on the fabric, or the tiny aluminum snowflakes said to have fallen into the world during an Opening over a century ago.
Aaben was such a collector. S/he was one of the geniod, whose gender varies according to mood, location, and other private considerations, and who are known, in the face of great trauma, to forget who they are and become entirely different personalities, their old selves never to be resumed or spoken of. Some races adulate them for this, while others mock them. Such excesses of reaction have driven the geniod to keep to themselves, not by law, but preference.
Aaben was an oddity in its own preferences, for it was willing to travel, to go farther than most of its race, driven by the desire to augment its collection, choosing to focus only on its quest.
The items it sought, ranging up and down the Tube in expeditions funded by two sets of indulgent grandparents and a much less indulgent set of parents, were things that could be considered metaphors for the world and the state of those in it. In this pursuit, it followed the strictures of the philosopher-king Nackle, who described the emotions that such objects evoked in the beholder in one five hundred page monograph, and the intellectual effect of such exposure in a second, even longer work, followed by a six volume set of explanatory footnotes and addendums.
Aaben had studied at the knee of an ancient human who had himself been instructed by an uncle who had read thoroughly in the works of Nackle. The teaching had impressed it with a gravity and depth of the sort that scores the soul and directs all its movements in later years. Its search was a tribute to Nackle&#8217;s ideas, for it looked for the things that Nackle posited existed, which could only be discovered by matching the emotion they evoked with that described in Nackle&#8217;s pages, a task that required the laborious memorization of all of the philosopher&#8217;s works.
Nackle&#8217;s theory, insofar as such a thing can be simplified, was this: Twenty one types of emotion exist in the world. Certain artifacts create emotions in the viewer, emotions unaffected by the viewer&#8217;s history or idiosyncrasies of personality, but which are basic to the existence of all intelligent creatures. There are literally hundreds of sub-emotions, ranging from a soul&#8217;s regret when it wishes to sing but cannot, to the joy of carrying on one&#8217;s ancestral line in the face of tremendous adversity or the anticipatory worry that one might not fully recall an upcoming oracular dream.
The perception of these emotions required deep study and meditation. To find the artifacts that replicated the base emotion, the one from which all the smaller sub-emotions sprang, one must move through a progression of refinement of the senses, created by the search for and exposure to artifacts exemplifying the emotions Nackle described.
Most of Nackle&#8217;s followers would object to this simplification. They would point to subtleties of one kind or another, but truth be told, the theory was relatively uncomplicated. It was the lengthy cataloging of emotions that gave the philosophy intellectual density, rather than any complex thou[...]</ns2:summary>

Health Tips for Traveler
by David W. Goldman
Since the short time from mutual greetings of worlds, many Earther wish to visit the lovely world of the Pooquar peoples. This explainer before so will bring yourselves a voyage most lovely.
Within The Transit
The travel via cross-continuum portal will be novel to many Earther. Hydration is a paramount for not having the small problems of liver, marrow, blood tubes, and self memory. Also good before your trip is to make fat, especially under the skin. The scrawny traveler should begin preparation many week prior.
Portal going is sudden and then done. But many Earther say after that they think the journey is very very very long and never to stop. Thus is Earther brains supposed bad attuned to one or more of the interim journey continuum. For thus, non-conscious makes for most lovely travel. Means of non-conscious both pharmacological and percussive are on offer by helpful Pooquar portal agents.
As the Early Days
Because subtle differences in physics regulations from what most Earther are parochially accustomed, the traveler is suggested to acclimate in the &#8220;horizontal&#8221; position until local niceties of unreliant gravity, time-keeping, and atmospheric presence become appreciated. Acclimation such will entertain you for no more than two &#8212; or for some traveler, twenty or thirty &#8212; &#8220;days.&#8221;
While thus occupied with your appreciation of localness, helpful Pooquar hostelry staffpersons will provide you with lovely hydration and fat-making nutritionals. For your best healths, stint not on your consumption.
Touring the Out-Vicinity
While you delight yourselves in the appreciation of very-known scenics as the Flowing Up Falls of Nagbaf, the Lesser Half Dark Big Hole, the Plain of Many Breath Sucks, and other such lovely vicissitudes, some attention to health and safeness are ordered.
Firstmost, if urgent advised by helpful Pooquar tour leader, immediately disobey not! Your very life endurance may happen. This is especially as pertains to stepping away from lovely trails, consuming unadvised nutritionals, perusing explainers offered by exiled dissident non-persons, or providing unsolicited refreshment to local fauna/flora/other life-beings.
Next, maintenance your lovely all-enwrapping tourist jumpsuit and coverall always. The presentation of the skin, even a small only piece of the skin, is discouraged for health. This from the fad of local life-beings to reproduce by injecting seed-forms into passing faunas, later to germinate and partake of the subcutaneous lipids in achieving bigness. Thus is best always your jumpsuit and coverall with integrity. (Small note: In the event of any rash of discolor or tendrils from the skin please notify immediately your helpful Pooquar tour leader for the swift extirpation.)
In finality, avoid districts of elevated temperature and humidity. In these grow the grubs of local life-beings, who may exhibit unsolicited hunger of lovely Earther visitor.
After leaving the out-vicinities, you should place the above-spoken biologic factual concerns far from your self memories.
Of the Urban Jollity
In welcome for subsequent your joyful tours of the out-vicinities, the Pooquar peoples of the citified regions will ply you unsparingly with lovely bring-home curios and appliances and also nutritionals without betterment for taste and skin-fat-making. Enjoy all these with loveliness!
In the cities is no great harm for concern of health. But be full of alert to avoiding speech from irks[...]</ns2:summary>

Chandra&#8217;s Game
by Samantha Henderson
Joey Straphos, Papa Joe, told me once that Chandra&#8217;s Game is a bitch of a city, fickle but generous when the mood strikes her.&#160; But Papa Joe was a romantic.
Chandra&#8217;s Game roots in the side of a barren asteroid moon like a tick.&#160; Over the years we&#8217;ve burrowed deeper into rock and ice until poor Chandra is mostly Game.&#160; We loop the twin wormholes, Gehenna and Tartarus, roundabout in a figure eight, ready to catch the freighters as they escape from hell&#8217;s dark maw.&#160; We strip them of goods and drink their heat, load them up and send them into another hell.&#160; It&#8217;s a profitable game, Chandra&#8217;s.
My mother smuggled me into Chandra&#8217;s Game without patronage and compounded her error by dying without permission; I was Terra-born unless she was lying, which was likely enough.&#160; I joined the other unregistereds down in the Warrens: ferals that lived off the Mayor&#8217;s Dole and by odd-jobs when that wasn&#8217;t enough.&#160; Papa Joe fed us, and sometimes the tunnels were glorious with the smell of meat, and if you were smart or hungry enough you didn&#8217;t ask from what.&#160; Where there&#8217;s humanity there are rats, and Joey wasn&#8217;t a rich man, not then.&#160; But food is food, and he&#8217;d bunk you if he could, and if all he asked in return for the latest Warren scuttlebutt or a few sticks of ephedrine off a freighter&#8217;s load, what of it?&#160; Saints are few and far between in Chandra&#8217;s Game.
Papa Joe always liked me: I stayed a bit feral, tomboy&#8212;nothing like his daughters.&#160; He had them late in life, when he got rich, and they were elegant, lux level creatures.&#160; Not like Joey, not like Mrs. Joe.&#160; She was quiet and kind, and if she knew a nano of Joey&#8217;s business she never let on.&#160; When Gregor Straphos died I died a little.&#160; But Mrs. Joe died all the way.
I&#8217;d been legit for years.&#160; I still snooped, but in an upright way.&#160; Helped the Company Men find bits of their loads that went astray between Gehenna and Tartarus, passed on Warren talk to the prefects when some smart kid got out of hand, pointed the way to speedwell labs that weren&#8217;t circumspect about what went into their product.&#160; Nothing that would disturb the delicate balance between the business of the Family, the Companies and the Mayor. 
Joey had his own snoops, payroll loyal.&#160; So when a grubby-faced feral knocked up my crib, saying Joey wanted a word, I had to wonder why.&#160; I hadn&#8217;t seen him in years.&#160; Not since Gregor was cremated.
Papa Joe never lived on the lux levels: too far away from his daily business.&#160; His crib was in that middle span twixt Warren and lux, where the heavy, humid smell of humans going about their dailies pervaded.&#160; Inset into the dull rough rock of Chandra&#8217;s tunnels, his entry was like mine but for the over-muscled toughs that bracketed it, giving me a once-over glare but no guff.&#160; Past his door it was different.
Good living thickened him.&#160; He gripped me by the shoulders, hard, and shook me, his heavy gold rings bruising my shoulders.
&#8220;It&#8217;s been a long time, Sarabet,&#8221; he rumbled.&#160; &#8220;Too long.&#8221;
He pushed me into an overstuffed sofa, and I looked at the crib with a professional eye.&#160; The room was luxurious, almost frivolous.&#160; The walls had been polished smooth, and intricate patterns were visible in the surface that looked so dull in the tunnels.&#160; The furniture, Terran-antique, could&#8217;ve kept me living high for years.&#160; A thick Thantopian carpet covered the floor, cut from the surface of a place Joey and me would never see&#8212;it was the probably the most precious thing in the place, beautifully marbled in blue and green.&#160; The warmth of it struck up through my thin corridor slippers.
There were ikons of people I didn&#8217;t recognize on tabletops and inset into the smooth walls.&#160; Some I did: there was Mrs. Joe, looking mild and maybe sl[...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>Amber Benson returned to her &lt;i&gt;Death's Daughter&lt;/i&gt; universe in 2010 with &lt;i&gt;Cat's Claw&lt;/i&gt;, a sequel that pretty much depends upon the main character making bad decisions for the story to succeed. Make no mistake, I still had fun reading the book, but there was an awful lot of narrative convenience in it.</description>

The half-buried thing hadn&#8217;t moved once, but I didn&#8217;t have to include that in the story when I got back to base. The great, gray mass of it rose at least ten feet out of the red earth, tucked close to the sheer wall of the plateau. That part I&#8217;d tell. If there had been anything like a head, I would have shot it, but it just looked like a giant, lumpy football, oozing a viscous yellowy liquid here and there.
The non-military personnel tried to remember their instructions, looking away from the muzzle of my rifle as the metallic squeal of the charging weapon warned of an impending discharge. The moment the noise ended, a pencil-thin beam of white light leapt from the gun and bored another sizzling hole into the motionless mound of wrinkled gray flesh. There was a sound like someone cooking giant bacon in a giant skillet.
I just can&#8217;t describe how much I love photon rifles. They&#8217;re big, noisy, ugly, unapologetic things that leave your hands shaking and the entire area smelling like ozone. They were shit on stealth missions but, then, so am I&#8212;that&#8217;s just one of the many reasons I got this gig as the Army equivalent of a galactic janitor.
Sergeant Wroblewski and I made eye contact as I turned to address the science team, and I noted the silent &#8220;high-five&#8221; look on his face.
&#8220;Well?&#8221; I said smoothly to Science Officer Neely. &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t get much deader than that.&#8221; I tried to look nonchalant.
Neely raised some sort of high-tech monocular to his eye and peered at the creature.
&#8220;No, I&#8217;m afraid not,&#8221; he said, shaking his head.
&#8220;What? That&#8217;s the fourth direct hit. What the hell is that goo bubbling out of it, if it isn&#8217;t dead?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not certain captain, but that &#8216;goo&#8217; was bubbling out of it when we arrived.&#8221;
&#8220;Christ, the thing has four holes through it that weren&#8217;t there when we got here. I may not know much, but I know dead. And that thing is dead.&#8221;
&#8220;Captain, we all have the same orders. We can&#8217;t establish a construction base, let alone a settlement, until we clear the indigenous flora and fauna from this sector. It is fortuitous that, on this occasion, there is only a single life form here. But, I&#8217;m telling you, that organism&#8217;s life signs have not changed since we arrived.&#8221;
&#8220;Look,&#8221; I said slowly, &#8220;I put holes in things. That&#8217;s how we kill things. It&#8217;s a tried and true method that has worked for humanity many, many times. What do you suggest I do next?&#8221;
&#8220;That isn&#8217;t really my area of expertise, but explosives come to mind.&#8221;
&#8220;I would agree with you, if I had brought any.&#8221; (Truthfully, I didn&#8217;t have the clearance to handle explosives.) &#8220;I was told &#8216;one, big sedentary critter.&#8217; Didn&#8217;t think I needed to bring detonators.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, then might I suggest. . .&#8221;
Neely&#8217;s lips kept moving, but it suddenly seemed like the sounds just plain weren&#8217;t reaching my ears. There was a strange subtle pressure building behind my eyes, and a low rumbling steadily becoming louder.
Neely&#8217;s mouth just kept flapping and I could tell that neither he, nor the rest of the group, felt anything out of the ordinary. Then, without warning, everything just stopped. I don&#8217;t mean the group stood still, I mean stopped&#8212;like I had just found myself in the middle of a photograph. The pressure in my head slacked to a general, sustained discomfort. It sorta felt like being in deep water, except that I could breathe and move just fine. I glanced up at a swirling cloud of whitish vapor that was now simply frozen motionless against the pinkish backdrop of the sky.
&#8220;Uh. . .&#8221; I said thoughtfully to nobody in particular. &#8220;That&#8217;s probably not good.&#8221;
&#8220;What, you mean you can&#8217;t do that?&#8221; Asked a voice behind me.
I whirled around, bracing the stock of my rifle against my shoulder as I moved.
&#8220;Seriously? That&#8217;s your plan? You&#8217;re really gonna shoot me with that thing[...]</ns2:summary>

Marley and Cratchit
by David Steffen
STAVE 1: THE MARVELOUS MACHINE
In those days Jacob Marley was full of life and vigor. His smile shone so that anyone who saw him soon smiled widely in return. A moment in his presence would make one&#8217;s worst burdens seem lighter. His optimism and generosity brought out the best in others, catching easily as a torch in dry straw.
Those were happy, hopeful times. Ebenezer Scrooge, the pinch-faced and greedy miser, would not weigh on his mind until many years later. In those later years the two men&#8217;s appearances matched as twins, and their customers would often confuse one for the other. But in every other manner they were as different as two men could be. I will speak further of Scrooge, but not yet, for this is not his tale. In these days long gone, Jacob Marley was a portly man, neatly dressed and neatly groomed, with hair black as pitch and never a whisker on his face. Marley entered the shop on that momentous day in the manner with which he was accustomed, swinging the door wide and exclaiming &#8220;Hallo!&#8221; to his business partner in a sonorous voice that any Shakespearian actor would envy. His jowls swung with the force of his entry, and wobbled like a custard for quite some time after. His clothes were not of the finest material, but were fine enough for a man of his young age, a sign of the moderate inheritance left him by his father the year prior. The front office held two desks, one tidy and one covered with heaps of paper and mechanisms.
Behind the cluttered desk Bob Cratchit looked up with a quiet smile. Where Marley was expansive and memorable, Cratchit was small and quiet and utterly forgettable. He was a pleasant man, so pleasant that I have only ever known one man to ever speak crossly of him: Scrooge, that nasty old miser who spoke crossly of everyone, regardless of cause. Look! He has intruded again upon our story where he is not wanted. I will speak of him no more until his presence enters upon the story.
Although Cratchit was a pleasant man, and earnest, he was easily&#160;forgotten, apt to leave no lasting impression on the memory. In fact,&#160;even I can no longer bring his features clearly to my mind. All I can
say of his appearance is that he was exceedingly ordinary in every respect, and he was of an age with his partner, both old enough to have earned their own reputation, but young enough to hold wild and optimistic musings of their future. Cratchit&#8217;s forgettable appearance suited him well enough, because people made him unaccountably nervous, and he found even idle conversation to be terribly taxing. If no one remembered him, then no one would seek him out and he would be left to his alchemy. In those days he did little else, his efforts supported by Marley&#8217;s coffers in the hopes of finding something to build a business on.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve finished it,&#8221; Cratchit. &#8220;I&#8217;ve finished my great work, the one which will make us our fortune.&#8221;
&#8220;Oh! Why didn&#8217;t you say so!&#8221; Marley asked, with a slap to Cratchit&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;To your feet, Bob. Jump with joy, shout from the rooftops.&#8221;
&#8220;I am quite excited,&#8221; Cratchit admitted, still smiling his quiet little smile. &#8220;Would you like to see it work?&#8221;
&#8220;Of course, of course.&#8221;
Cratchit led the way to the workroom in the back where Marley hadn&#8217;t ventured for months, not wanting to disturb the alchemical processes. The workroom was but a larger manifestation of the cluttered desk at the front, packed from wall to wall with papers and metalwork, beakers and boilers. Cratchit&#8217;s newest and greatest work stood in the center of the room, looking like a shrine within its circle of clear space. It was an upright wooden hoop a pace in diameter, with strang[...]</ns2:summary>

Shutdown
By Corry L. Lee
The alarm blared over the forest&#8217;s metallic rustling, and my HUD&#8217;s red&#160;warning light glazed the view through my faceplate. Ten seconds until&#160;the defense scan hit my position. Ten seconds until any motion, any&#160;electrical signature would whip vines down from the iron-cored trees,&#160;wrapping me as surely as steel cables, pinning me while cutter-bugs&#160;took me apart.
My muscles clenched, and I froze. The training sims hadn&#8217;t prepared me for the terror twisting my gut, for the way my heart seemed to dance a _pas-de-bourr&#233;e_, its ballerina toes rapping against my ribs.
I didn&#8217;t have time to panic. I chinned my skinsuit&#8217;s kill switch and dropped to the forest floor. In the silence after the klaxon died, my breather hissed out one final gasp of oxygen. The red glow faded from my faceplate and the forest closed in, dark without the HUD&#8217;s gain and unnaturally silent without the suit&#8217;s audio pickups. Weak sunlight filtered through the thick canopy, yellowed by sulfur gas, enough to make out shapes but not details. In sims, they&#8217;d cut our visual enhancement, but they must have extrapolated badly because the shadows had never been this deep, the shafts of sunlight never so diseased.
I crouched on a patch of dirt, crumpling fallen leaves but avoiding the forest&#8217;s ragged undergrowth. I folded my legs beneath me, splaying my arms for balance. My hands slipped on the metal-rich berries that covered the ground as if someone had derailed a freight train of ball bearings. I swept some impatiently aside and rested my helmeted forehead on the dirt. How much time had passed? Eight seconds? No time to worry.
Gritting my teeth, I stopped my heart.
A vise seemed to close about my chest. Sweat beaded on my brow as I dragged in one last breath, my body panicking, automatic reflexes screaming at me to fight, to struggle, to escape. I fought them as Sergeant Miller and Captain Johnston trained me, fought them and stopped breathing. My vision narrowed. My lips tingled and went numb. _Twelve minutes_, I repeated to myself as the forest grew dark and disappeared.
_You&#8217;ll come back._ The words echoed in Sergeant Miller&#8217;s clipped bark. Just a few minutes ago he&#8217;d given me the thumbs-up after checking my suit&#8217;s seals. He&#8217;d rapped his knuckles against my helmet for luck, and I&#8217;d stridden toward this forested hell.
#
&#8220;So, Amaechi,&#8221; Private Yaradua said as I topped my glass off from her flask. &#8220;If we were back on Hope&#8217;s Landing, what would you do with your last night?&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;d go whoring,&#8221; Obasanjo said. &#8220;Nice place in Makurdi where&#8211;&#8221;
&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t call it _nice_,&#8221; Tamunosaki said. &#8220;You mean cheap.&#8221;
&#8220;No, not that place we went with Akpu-nku. There&#8217;s one uptown.&#8221; Obasanjo shrugged. &#8220;Might as well spend all my money, right?&#8221; He said it like a joke, but nobody laughed.
Yaradua knocked her glass back, and Balogun focused on twirling her knife. We headed planetside at 0800 tomorrow, and MilComm gave slim odds that we&#8217;d make it back. The silence stretched, Obasanjo looking expectantly around for someone to agree with him.
Yaradua clanged her empty glass down on the table. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t fucking ask you, Obasanjo. I asked Amaechi.&#8221;
&#8220;She&#8217;d probably go to the ballet,&#8221; he said with a snort.
The corners of my glass dug into my palms; I wondered if I could squeeze it hard enough for it to shatter. The two missing fingers on my left hand itched. I twitched the stub of my middle finger, and contemplated slamming my glass into Obasanjo&#8217;s forehead. If it weren&#8217;t for those [...]</ns2:summary>

&#8220;You&#8217;ve done well,&#8221; Creative Director Len Palladon said, looking over Sophia&#8217;s r&#233;sum&#233;.
Sophia squinted in the golden California sun that fell on her through the huge windows of the conference room. She wanted to pinch herself to be sure she wasn&#8217;t dreaming. She was here, really here, on the hallowed campus of Semaphore Pictures, in an interview with the legendary Palladon.
She licked her dry lips. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always wanted to make movies.&#8221; She choked back _for Semaphore_. She didn&#8217;t want to seem too desperate.
Palladon was in his thirties, dressed in a pair of comfortable shorts and a plain gray t-shirt whose front was covered with the drawing of a man swinging a large hammer over a railroad spike. A pioneer in computer-assisted movie making, he had been instrumental in writing the company&#8217;s earliest software and was the director of _The Mesozoic_, Semaphore&#8217;s first film.
He nodded and went on, &#8220;You won the Zoetrope screenwriting competition, earned excellent grades in both technology and liberal arts, and got great recommendations from your film studies professors. It couldn&#8217;t have been easy.&#8221;
To Sophia, he seemed a bit pale and tired, as though he had been spending all his time indoors, not out in the golden California sun. She imagined that Palladon and his animators must have been working overtime to meet a deadline: probably to finish the new film scheduled to be released this summer.
&#8220;I believe in working hard,&#8221; Sophia said. What she really wanted was to tell him that she knew what it meant to stay up all night in front of the editing workstation and wait for the rendering to complete, all for the chance to catch the first glimpse of a vision coming to life on the screen. She was ready.
Palladon took off his reading glasses, smiled at Sophia, and took out a tablet from behind him. He touched its screen and slid it across the table to Sophia. A video was playing on it.
&#8220;There was also this fan film, which you didn&#8217;t put on your r&#233;sum&#233;. You made it out of footage cut and spliced from our movies, and it went viral. Several million views in two weeks, right? You gave our lawyers quite a headache.&#8221;
Sophia&#8217;s heart sank. She had always suspected that this might become a problem. But when the invitation to interview at Semaphore came in her email, she had whooped and hollered, and dared to believe that somehow the executives at Semaphore had missed that little film.
#
Sophia remembered going to _The Mesozoic_. She was seven. The lights dimmed, her parents stopped talking, the first few bars of Semaphore&#8217;s signature tune began to play, and she became still.
Over the next two hours, as she sat there in the dark theater, mesmerized by the adventure of the digital characters on that screen, she fell in love. She didn&#8217;t know it then, but she would never love a person as much as she loved the company that made her cry and laugh, the company that made _The Mesozoic_.
A Semaphore movie meant something: no, not merely technological prowess in digital animation and computer graphics that were better than life. Sure, these accomplishments were impressive, but it was Semaphore&#8217;s consistent ability to tell a great _story_, to make movies with _heart_, to entertain and move the six-year old along with the sixteen-year old and the sixty-year old, that truly made it an icon, a place worthy of being loved.
Sophia saw each of Semaphore&#8217;s films hundreds of times. She bought them multiple times, in successive digital formats: discs, compressed downloads, lossless codecs, enhanced and re-enhanced and super-enhanced.
She knew each scene down to the second, could recite every line of dialogue from memory. She didn&#8217;t even need the movies themselves any more; she could play them in her head.
She took film studies classes and began to make her own shorts, and she yearned to make them _feel_ as great as the Sem[...]</ns2:summary>

Captain Sandels came in during prep.&#160; &#8220;Falcon,&#8221; he said, but softly, as if he didn&#8217;t want to disturb the techs working on squeezing me into the bomb casing.&#160; I twittered our channel and winked: Kind of busy right now. Something come up?
&#8220;No,&#8221; the captain responded, again so softly that I knew he definitely didn&#8217;t want the techs to overhear.&#160; The only reason I could hear him was that my acoustic enhancements were so sensitive that I could hear a mouse fart from a klick away.&#160; &#8220;I just wanted to wish you luck.&#8221;
For making it back? I answered.&#160; Not likely.
&#8220;That&#8217;s brutal,&#8221; he replied and I heard his pain. &#8220;I thought that, after all we. . .&#8217;
I stopped him there.&#160; I&#8217;m not Falcon; just a revised edition.
&#8220;So it&#8217;s just goodbye, then?&#8221;
Sure.&#160; I closed the channel before he could say anything else.&#160; What I don&#8217;t need now is some damn puzzling reference to a past that no longer concerned me. Better not to dwell on the past.&#160; Given humanity&#8217;s precarious state, sentiment was dangerous.&#160; Besides, I had to concentrate on my scouting mission. We had to learn more about the aliens on the planet below.
I shut everything but the maintenance channel as they oozing the cushioning gel around me.&#160; Its plasticity enfolds me in a warm, soft embrace that creeps into every crack and crevice, sealing me off from sight and sound and every sense save an assurance of my own humanity.&#160; My form might be much reduced, to be sure, but nevertheless I retain my inherent humanity.
&#8220;We&#8217;re closing the lid,&#8221; the tech reports over the maintenance channel.
It&#8217;s time for sleep.&#160; Landing will wake me up.
&#160;
#
The idea behind the drop was dramatic and simple.&#160; Three attack cruisers would carpet bomb the area where the aliens landed.&#160; The drops consisted of ten burrowers, thirty sweepers, and twenty HE bombs from each ship, all distributed to randomly bracket the target. The third, eleventh, and nineteenth bomb of each pod were slow-fuse HE duds, except for the one that contained me.
I woke as soon as the bomb slammed into the ground on an oblique angle.&#160; I was not quite fully awake by the second bounce but fully aware as my container rolled down some piece of bumpy geography, stopped, and rocked for a moment before finding a stable orientation.&#160; I pushed up to pop the hatch and got out, dripping gel over the dented casing of the faux bomb.
I quickly scanned the area around me.&#160; Apparently I&#8217;d tumbled down a steep cliff to come to rest at the bottom among assorted rocks that had fallen from the eroding slope.&#160; I could feel the shock of exploding ordinance through my feet as the delay fuses fired.&#160; That told me that I&#8217;d landed near the center of the distribution.
My empty casing still packed a punch &#8211;enough to fool a casual inspection into thinking it was just another delayed bomb&#8211; and the clock was running.&#160; I moved away to put as much distance as I could between me and the bomb before it &#8211;WHAM&#8211; exploded and threw me tumbling ass over teacup.&#160; Shit!&#160; The techs had set the fuse&#8217;s timer too short.&#160; Well, nothing I could do about that now, but I check my systems to be certain and find that no harm was done.&#160; I am hyper-alert to my surroundings and take note of insect sounds, random wind action on the sparse vegetation, small animal movements, and the trembling ground beneath my feet to establish a baseline of whatever passed for &#8220;normal&#8221; on this planet.&#160; So far, everything agreed with the data the former colonists had provided.
Every ten meters I stop to feel the ground for approaching footfalls.&#160; I am continually sniffing the air for any unusual smell, listening for any sound, and watching for anything that might be artificial. At the same time I was &#8220;lis[...]</ns2:summary>

Concussion
By&#160;David Glen Larson

He scrambled from the fire that was snaking through the corridor when another explosion jolted the ship, and just like that he was dead again. A moment later he was someone else, gazing down with another&#8217;s eyes at the mangled green body he&#8217;d left behind.
Never before had Tyler experienced such terror. Sure, he&#8217;d been afraid&#8212;afraid his knee would give out again, sidelining him for the big game; afraid he&#8217;d let down his teammates and make a fool of himself&#8212;but he&#8217;d never been terrified of being incinerated in an alien system countless light-years from the home world he was forced to flee. Not until now.
Staring up at the night sky, the stars were dim under the glare of the stadium lights. Which star was theirs? He caught himself and shook his aching head. It was only a dream, after all. The frog people weren&#8217;t real.
The doctor shined a penlight into each pupil. &#8220;Any headache, nausea, or dizziness?&#8221;
&#8220;What do you think? I was just hit by a freight train.&#8221; Good old Number 32&#8212;the biggest, meanest linebacker in the NFL.
&#8220;You may have a concussion.&#8221;
Coach Landis spit tobacco juice on the grass only inches from Tyler&#8217;s head. &#8220;We&#8217;re down 22-27 in the fourth quarter with under a minute to go. Montoya&#8217;s out, Casper&#8217;s out, and now you&#8217;re saying I&#8217;m out my third string too? Uh-uh, Doc. I need Harden in the game.&#8221;
&#8220;If he takes another hit&#8212;&#8221;
&#8220;A few aches and pains go with the territory,&#8221; said the coach.
&#8220;Forget aches and pains. I&#8217;m talking stroke or death. Those go with the territory?&#8221;
&#8220;Ordinarily no, but this is the Super Bowl and I&#8217;m out of quarterbacks.&#8221;
&#8220;I can play, Coach.&#8221; Tyler rolled onto his knees and wobbled to his feet with a groan. Lights flashed and popped behind his eyes, some internal wiring knocked loose, but he didn&#8217;t let on. &#8220;I&#8217;m fine.&#8221;
Tyler teetered backward, but the coach steadied him, pretending to pat him on the back.
&#8220;That a boy. See, Doc? It was just a tap.&#8221;
&#8220;All right, but I&#8217;ll need to check his cognitive function after every play.&#8221;
&#8220;Whatever you say,&#8221; said the coach.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to ask you to remember a list of five words. If you can&#8217;t repeat them back to me, you&#8217;re a NO-GO.&#8221;
&#8220;Apple, wrench, sombrero, parrot, porcupine,&#8221; Tyler said with confidence.
&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t give you the words yet.&#8221;
&#8220;Sure you did. Last season against the Colts. It was the only time I played. Number 24 clocked me from behind on our 15.&#8221;
&#8220;Well I&#8217;m glad to see your long-term memory isn&#8217;t impaired, but it&#8217;s your short-term memory that concerns me.&#8221;
&#8220;Fine, but make it quick. I have a qweetah to win.&#8221;
&#8220;Beg your pardon?&#8221;
&#8220;I said, make it quick. I have a game to win.&#8221;
#
The clock was frozen with 54 seconds to go, a lifetime on the field.
&#8220;This is it, Fellas. Whole country&#8217;s watching us. Hell, the whole world. Presidents, kings, grandmothers, your own mothers and kids, and God. Every one of &#8216;em watching to see if we have what it takes to dig deep and pull out a victory. Let&#8217;s not disappoint them.&#8221;
They broke with a clap and toed the line of scrimmage, growling, snorting like racehorses waiting to spring from the gate. But the other side showed blitz.
Even if there had been time for the coach to call a new play, they&#8217;d been having trouble with the headsets. The broadcast booth had complained about it all night. Something about atmospheric distortion. That left Tyler with only one option. He had to call an audible.
But running through the plays in his head was like slogging through quicksand. He still heard the screams, the frog-peoples&#8217; cries for help. Jagged lightning stabbed into his brain, and he clamped his eyes shut, trying to push them all away. He needed a play. And then he [...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>&lt;i&gt;John Dies at the End&lt;/i&gt; by David Wong is ostensibly about a drug called soy sauce that immensely sharpens a person's perception of reality. But it's about so much more than that as well. So much that it took me four days to write the review.</description>

Punk Voyager
By&#160;Shaenon K. Garrity

Punk Voyager was built by punks. &#160;They made it from beer cans, razors, safety pins, and a surfboard some D-bag had left on the beach. Also plutonium. &#160;Where did they get plutonium? &#160;Around. &#160;f*** you.
The punks who built Punk Voyager were Johnny Bonesaw, Johnny Razor, Mexican Johnny D-bag, Red Viscera, and some other guys. &#160;No, asshole, nobody remembers what other guys. &#160;They were f***ing wasted, these punks. &#160;They&#8217;d been drinking on the San Diego beach all day and night, talking about making a run to Tijuana and then forgetting and punching each other. &#160;They&#8217;d built a fire on the beach, and all night the fire went up and went down while the punks threw beer cans at the seagulls.
Forget the s*** I just said, it wasn&#8217;t the punks who did it. &#160;They were f***ing punks. &#160;The hell they know about astro-engineering? Truth is that Punk Voyager was the strung-out masterpiece of Mexican Johnny D-bag&#8217;s girlfriend, Lacuna, who had a doctorate in structural engineering. &#160;Before she burned out and ran for the coast, Lacuna was named Alice McGuire and built secret nuclear submarines for a government contractor in Ohio. &#160;It sucked. &#160;But that was where she got the skills to construct an unmanned deep-space probe. &#160;Same principle, right? &#160;Keep the radiation in and the water out. &#160;Or the vacuum of space, whatever, it&#8217;s all the same s*** to an engineer.
f*** that, it wasn&#8217;t really Lacuna&#8217;s baby. &#160;It wasn&#8217;t her idea. &#160;The idea was Red&#8217;s.
&#8220;f***ing space,&#8221; he said that fateful night. &#160;He was lying on his back looking up at space, is why he said it.
&#8220;Hell yeah,&#8221; said Johnny Bonesaw.
&#8220;s*** ain&#8217;t nothing but rocks and UFOs.&#8221;
&#8220;Ain&#8217;t no such thing as a UFO.&#8221;
&#8220;Like hell there ain&#8217;t,&#8221; said Red. &#160;&#8220;CIA knows all about it. &#160;Them and the astronauts.&#8221;
Red was always saying that s***, though. &#160;Everything was the CIA and the saucer people with that burnout.
&#8220;That&#8217;s why they sent up that cigar-box spaceship with the porn in it,&#8221; said Red. &#160;&#8220;They know there&#8217;s life up there.&#8221;
&#8220;What spaceship?&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;There&#8217;s no f***ing spaceship.&#8221;
&#8220;He means the Voyager space probe,&#8221; said Lacuna. &#8220;Which is real, asshole.&#8221;
Lacuna was pissing off everyone but Mexican Johnny D-bag with her knowing-s*** routine. &#160;That and eating all the mushrooms and throwing them up in the ocean.
&#8220;I want wine,&#8221; Johnny Razor yelled down the beach. &#160;&#8220;Mexican wine. Weren&#8217;t we going to Tijuana?&#8221;
&#8220;We already went,&#8221; yelled Mexican Johnny D-bag. &#160;&#8220;We went without you. &#160;We&#8217;re not even here.&#8221; &#160;Then he laughed like a pinhead. &#160;He was on some s***.
&#8220;Keep it down,&#8221; snapped Lacuna. &#160;&#8220;I&#8217;m telling these assholes about the space probe.&#8221;
&#8220;f*** the space probe,&#8221; said Johnny Bonesaw.
&#8220;The Voyager 1 space probe,&#8221; said Lacuna, &#8220;was launched into space to study the gas giants and then continue out beyond the solar system.&#8221;
&#8220;No s***?&#8221;
&#8220;Told you it was real,&#8221; said Red. &#160;&#8220;But the thing is, the important thing is the messages it&#8217;s got in it. &#160;For the space people. &#160;Tell him about the messages.&#8221;
Down the beach, Johnny Razor and Mexican Johnny D-bag started punching each other, mostly for something to do.
&#8220;Okay, yeah. &#160;Voyager carries a record of stuff from Earth for the aliens to find.&#8221;
&#8220;And naked pictures. &#160;They put in naked pictures of people.&#8221;
&#8220;Yeah, whatever, naked pictures. &#160;And photos, different languages, music, stuff like that.&#8221;
&#8220;Music?&#8221; said Johnny Bonesaw.
&#8220;What music?&#8221; said Red.
&#8220;Um.&#8221; Lacuna chewed her lip, thinking. &#160;&#8220;Beethoven, maybe. &#160;Or Mozart. &#160;You know, classical music. &#160;And tribal stuff, like, from around the world. &#160;And &#8216;Johnny B. Goode.&#8217;&#8221;
Johnny Bonesaw and Red stared at her. &#160;They stared up at space. &#160;They stared back at her.
&#8220;Chuck Berry?&#8221; [...]</ns2:summary>

About the author&#8230;
Mark is an ex-rocket scientist with a doctorate in physics so has an unwitting talent for taking the magic out of twinkling stars, sunsets, colourful flames dancing in a roaring fire, and rainbows.
His medium term aims are to introduce other fathers to the world of creative storytelling, and to find his feet with short story writing. This will involve him having to appreciate that what he sees as funny does not always accord with other people&#8217;s points of view.
Christchurch, New Zealand has been his home for 10 years with all the ups and downs that entails.
&#160;
Elias Smith and Jones
By&#160;Mark English

Every space in the four thousand seat lecture theatre was taken. Additional folk had snuck in to sit on the dark steps at the back. With everyone whispering discretely, the noise was deafening to the grizzled old-timer who stood leaning on the lecturn at the front&#8212;or it would have been except for the myPod player earbuds delivering their tinny frantic bluegrass tunes into his head. He chuckled to himself as he looked up at the wall of people in front of him. Political leaders, military leaders, space systems engineers; all desperate to hear the words of an aged ship&#8217;s monkey from the Frontier. All because he and his co-conspirators had blackmailed the solar system.
Elias chuckled to himself again. Who would have figured things would have turned out so? He plucked the ear buds out. Instant silence. The university had scored a coup in convincing one of the Sundance gang to tell their tale since any spaceway robbers were generally executed. However the Sundance gang had a thirty year old secret, one that everyone wanted. With the removal of the first earbud old Elias had indicated he was ready to start; all the spectators held their breath.
Elias turned his face up to the watchers, felt the bright lights warming his face, and smiled a toothy grin. &#8220;Howdy folks, I&#8217;m good an&#8217; pleased to be here today, to see so many notables amongst you. Some I have met before.&#8221; A five star general shuffled uncomfortably in his seat as if the warm smile made him sweat&#8212;which it did. Elias continued in his soft southern-states patois. &#8220;We are gathered here today to hear a story, so let&#8217;s go back thirty years, back to when I was even more good lookin&#8217;. My partners and I had just obtained a large cargo of rare earth metals from an asteroid cargo waggon, and this had been mistak&#8217;n for a robbery. I guess after these years I gotta &#8216;fess up and say that it sure as hell was a robbery!&#8221; Elias leaned forward and grinned at the Sheriff-Admiral in the front row like he was about to lay a golden egg&#8212;which as history showed he had (in a manner of speaking). The Sheriff-Admiral returned a tight grimace filled with thirty years of difficult restraint.
###
Elias Earnbuckle leaned on his broom next to Captain Miriam Smith and Jones-the-gun as they looked through the rear viewing port. The star field was tremendous with Sol out of view. The nearest asteroids shone starkly black and white, with sunlight flooding them edge-on. However it was Mars that held their attention. Or more correctly, it was the glow from the foldspace-prow of the rapidly approaching sheriff&#8217;s pursuit boat with Mars as a back-drop, that garnered their attention.
Smith leaned her weight onto her left leg and crossed her arms. &#8220;That was a quick response.&#8221; Elias and Jones grunted in unison. Jones as man-at-arms was second in command and Elias, as general gopher and do-all, was the ship&#8217;s rat and the closest thing the gang had ever had to an engineer.
Jones unconsciously mimicked his boss, placing his weight on his left leg and crossing his heavily muscled arms over a chest designed to awe folk [...]</ns2:summary>

And it is good -- very good -- except for the places where it can't get out of its own way fast enough.</description>

They Go Bump
By&#160;David Barr Kirtley

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ball placed his feet carefully. Walking on rough terrain was treacherous when you couldn&#8217;t see your feet &#8212; or your legs, for that matter, or any part of yourself. All he could see was the uneven ground, the shady stones outlined with sharp sunlight, drifting eerily beneath him. His boot caught and twisted, and he pitched forward, falling and smacking his elbows rough against the ground.
From somewhere up on the hilltop, Cataldo&#8217;s voice laughed. That voice &#8212; smooth and measured, with just a hint of sharpness. Ball had never paid much attention to voices before, but now voices were all he had.
Cataldo&#8217;s shouted, &#8220;Was that you, Ball? Again?&#8221;
Ball groped on the ground for his rifle. He felt it, grasped it, and slung it over his shoulder. He clambered to his feet, and wavered there a few moments, unsteady.
Cataldo&#8217;s voice again: &#8220;How many times is that now? Twelve?&#8221;
&#8220;Eleven.&#8221; Ball groaned, stretched, and looked around. &#8220;Where are you?&#8221;
&#8220;By the rock.&#8221;
Ball sighed. The rock. There was nothing but rocks, nothing but rolling expanses of rocks and more rocks, stretching to the horizon in every direction. The orange sky was littered with rocks, too, rocky moons. &#8220;Which rock?&#8221;
&#8220;The big, triangular one.&#8221;
Ball squinted up the hill.
&#8220;See the tall peak?&#8221; Cataldo&#8217;s voice prompted. &#8220;Follow the gully down. There&#8217;s a patch of boulders, and then at the edge of those there&#8217;s this big, triangular &#8211;&#8221;
&#8220;All right, I see it.&#8221; Ball took a deep breath. &#8220;I&#8217;m coming.&#8221;
He scrambled over the boulders and picked his way carefully among smaller stones. He tried to picture Cataldo&#8217;s face &#8212; slick black hair, long, narrow face, oversized nose. Ball hadn&#8217;t seen that face all day. Now there was just the voice. &#8220;OK, I&#8217;m here,&#8221; he breathed, finally.
The empty spot of nothingness that was Cataldo said, &#8220;Where&#8217;s Sweezy?&#8221;
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; Ball shook his head, though he realized Cataldo couldn&#8217;t see it anyway. &#8220;He hasn&#8217;t said anything all day. I&#8217;ve tried talking to him.&#8221;
Cataldo groaned. &#8220;Sweezy! Hey, Sweezy! Where are you?&#8221;
The vast plains of boulders were stony and silent. There was no answer.
&#8220;He might have fallen behind,&#8221; Ball said. &#8220;Maybe he got lost, or hurt his ankle.&#8221;
&#8220;He&#8217;s out there. Goddamnit, Sweezy! Sound off.&#8221;
Finally, a plaintive voice, from far down in the rockslide, called out, &#8220;I&#8217;m here. What?&#8221;
Sweezy. His voice tended to waver as he spoke. It always seemed tired and prickly, that voice. Ball shouted, &#8220;We&#8217;re checking to make sure you&#8217;re still with us.&#8221;
&#8220;Just go,&#8221; Sweezy&#8217;s voice said. &#8220;I can take care of myself.&#8221;
Cataldo grunted in disgust, and said to Ball, &#8220;Come on. Let&#8217;s catch up with the others.&#8221;
Ball turned wearily, and moved to follow. He walked in the direction he thought Cataldo had gone.
Invisible soldiers. Ball chuckled tiredly. Invisible soldiers on an important mission, invisible soldiers with invisible feet.
He tripped again, and fell.
The week before, Ball had been safe, tucked far underground in the winding, humid, steel &#8212; rimmed tunnels of Fort Deep. He had been sitting on a hard bench outside Captain Schemmer&#8217;s office.
They were giving Ball a mission; he wondered if he was going to die. Cataldo had come and gone already, but Sweezy was still in there. Ball could [...]</ns2:summary>

The First Book of Flaccid Swords
by Edward Cowan
It was a snake&#8211;and Gods, what a snake it was. Fifty feet from sweeping tail to flicking tongue, its eyes as cold as deepest space and dim as the farthest star, its fangs dripping poison so vile the stench alone would kill a lesser man.
This, then, was the dreaded Doom of Lla Haathra, into whose black maw the unlucky and damned were fed to the Impotent God. Never having counted myself among His faithful, I saw no reason to submit meekly to His wrath.
His priests had made one crushing mistake when they lured me onto the trap door: they failed to relieve me of my blade. _Wind,_ they called it, those for whom that name was the last word to leave their lips. I rushed the foul altar, upon which lay my Darinda, black chains coiling about her supple form, her body purest alabaster against the crimson stone marbling her flesh. Tsutu Kalai, highest of the wretched priests, cackled as I approached, throwing the lever that opened the trap. Darinda&#8217;s scream followed me down the endless, serpentine flue. Beyond that, darkness.
Rolling to my feet, I stood in the shaft of light piercing the abyss from the chamber above, Wind held before me, daring the almost tangible shadow to draw near. Within moments came a rasping omen, as of a great mass dragging itself awake after a slumber of eons.
Now the Doom reared before me, thrusting its head into the light. We goaded one another to strike&#8211;it with the insolence of the predator that has never known failure, I with a rage that would never be clenched till the serpent&#8217;s blood coated my blade from point to pommel. From above echoed the laughter of the priests and the muffled screams of my Darinda. Here there was only silence&#8211;the sweet anticipation of the moment before death.
Finally I saluted the beast with a nod and spoke: &#8220;At least your masters have granted me a worthy adversary. Very well; let us have at it. I will not pretend to the ancient patience of the serpentfolk.&#8221;
It hissed its reply.
At that I lunged. Its mammoth head darted forward quicker than mercury, but primal speed avails not against human cunning. I ducked its strike and gripped my blade for the piercing jab: up under the jaw and through the skull. I sprang up, mighty thews tensing for the killing blow&#8211;
And found myself holding a wet noodle.
BREAK
Static shrieks as Jessica tears off her headgear and hurls it to the floor. Test pattern jackhammers my eyes and ears.
That&#8217;s the thing about couples therapy: when one quits, she drags the other with her. And you can&#8217;t do it unless you do it together.
Repeat ad nauseam and there&#8211;you&#8217;ve got a bead on the entire experience.
She glares at me from her couch. &#8220;You died _again,_ didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
BREAK
Clearing his throat, Dr. Freundlich removes his own headgear with none of his patients&#8217; violent frustration. He regards us across the vast mahogany plane of his desk, steepling his fingertips, tap-tap-tapping them together.
&#8220;We are not making the progress we had hoped for, hmm?&#8221;
Jessica and I shift on our couches&#8211;the same vivid red as Lla Haathra&#8217;s altar&#8211;searching for comfort or at least a spot of dignity in what she calls the &#8220;birthing position&#8221;: feet level with head, ankles parted. This posture is designed for optimum relaxation, says the doctor. I say it&#8217;s designed to keep us permanently at bay; from these positions we gaze up at him as children to father.
Jessica shushes me when I mutter things like that, but the doctor doesn&#8217;t disagree. _It is in fact necessary; in the realm of the neue psychology, patients no longer want friends or confidants. In these times of broken homes, late marriage and early divorce, they desire discipline, orde[...]</ns2:summary>

The Tamarisk Hunter
by Paolo Bacigalupi

&#160;&#8220;The Tamarisk Hunter&#8221; originally appeared in the environmental journal High Country News. It was inspired by the only thing that really matters in the Western U.S. &#8212; water.
A big tamarisk can suck 73,000 gallons of river water a year. For $2.88 a day, plus water bounty, Lolo rips tamarisk all winter long.
Ten years ago, it was a good living. Back then, tamarisk shouldered up against every riverbank in the Colorado River Basin, along with cottonwoods, Russian olives, and elms. Ten years ago, towns like Grand Junction and Moab thought they could still squeeze life from a river.
Lolo stands on the edge of a canyon, Maggie the camel his only companion. He stares down into the deeps. It&#8217;s an hour&#8217;s scramble to the bottom. He ties Maggie to a juniper and starts down, boot-skiing a gully. A few blades of green grass sprout neon around him, piercing juniper-tagged snow clods. In the late winter, there is just a beginning surge of water down in the deeps; the ice is off the river edges. Up high, the mountains still wear their ragged snow mantles. Lolo smears through mud and hits a channel of scree, sliding and scattering rocks. His jugs of tamarisk poison gurgle and slosh on his back. His shovel and rockbar snag on occasional junipers as he skids by. It will be a long hike out. But then, that&#8217;s what makes this patch so perfect. It&#8217;s a long way down, and the riverbanks are largely hidden.

It&#8217;s a living; where other people have dried out and blown away, he has remained: a tamarisk hunter, a water tick, a stubborn bit of weed. Everyone else has been blown off the land as surely as dandelion seeds, set free to fly south or east, or most of all north where watersheds sometimes still run deep and where even if there are no more lush ferns or deep cold fish runs, at least there is still water for people.
Eventually, Lolo reaches the canyon bottom. Down in the cold shadows, his breath steams.
He pulls out a digital camera and starts shooting his proof. The Bureau of Reclamation has gotten uptight about proof. They want different angles on the offending tamarisk, they want each one photographed before and after, the whole process documented, GPS&#8217;d, and uploaded directly by the camera. They want it done on-site. And then they still sometimes come out to spot check before they calibrate his headgate for water bounty.
But all their due diligence can&#8217;t protect them from the likes of Lolo. Lolo has found the secret to eternal life as a tamarisk hunter. Unknown to the Interior Department and its BuRec subsidiary, he has been seeding new patches of tamarisk, encouraging vigorous brushy groves in previously cleared areas. He has hauled and planted healthy root balls up and down the river system in strategically hidden and inaccessible corridors, all in a bid for security against the swarms of other tamarisk hunters that scour these same tributaries. Lolo is crafty. Stands like this one, a quarter-mile long and thick with salt-laden tamarisk, are his insurance policy.
Documentation finished, he unstraps a folding saw, along with his rockbar and shovel, and sets his poison jugs on the dead salt bank. He starts cutting, slicing into the roots of the tamarisk, pausing every 30 seconds to spread Garlon 4 on the cuts, poisoning the tamarisk wounds faster than they can heal. But some of the best tamarisk, the most vigorous, he uproots and sets aside, for later use.
$2.88 a day, plus water bounty.
* * *
It takes Maggie&#8217;s rolling bleating camel stride a week to make it back to Lolo&#8217;s homestead. They follow the river, occasionally climbing above it onto cold mesas or wandering off into the open desert in a bid to avoid the skeleton sprawl of emptied towns. Guardie choppers buzz up and down the river like swarms of angry yellow jackets, hunting fo[...]</ns2:summary>

&#8220;The Very Pulse of the Machine&#8221;
by Michael Swanwick
&#160;
Click.
The radio came on.
&#8220;Hell.&#8221;
Martha kept her eyes forward, concentrated on walking. Jupiter to one shoulder, Daedalus&#8217;s plume to the other. Nothing to it. Just trudge, drag, trudge, drag. Piece of cake.
&#8220;Oh.&#8221;
She chinned the radio off.
Click.
&#8220;Hell. Oh. Kiv. El. Sen.&#8221;
&#8220;Shut up, shut up, shut up!&#8221; Martha gave the rope an angry jerk, making the sledge carrying Burton&#8217;s body jump and bounce on the sulfur hardpan. &#8220;You&#8217;re dead, Burton, I&#8217;ve checked, there&#8217;s a hole in your faceplate big enough to stick a fist through, and I really don&#8217;t want to crack up. I&#8217;m in kind of a tight spot here and I can&#8217;t afford it, okay? So be nice and just shut the f*** up.&#8221;
&#8220;Not. Bur. Ton.&#8221;
&#8220;Do it anyway.&#8221;
She chinned the radio off again.
Jupiter loomed low on the western horizon, big and bright and beautiful and, after two weeks on Io, easy to ignore. To her left, Daedalus was spewing sulfur and sulfur dioxide in a fan two hundred kilometers high. The plume caught the chill light from an unseen sun and her visor rendered it a pale and lovely blue. Most spectacular view in the universe, and she was in no mood to enjoy it.
Click.
Before the voice could speak again, Martha said, &#8220;I am not going crazy, you&#8217;re just the voice of my subconscious, I don&#8217;t have the time to waste trying to figure out what unresolved psychological conflicts gave rise to all this, and I am not going to listen to anything you have to say.&#8221;
Silence.

The moonrover had flipped over at least five times before crashing sideways against a boulder the size of the Sydney Opera House. Martha Kivelsen, timid groundling that she was, was strapped into her seat so tightly that when the universe stopped tumbling, she&#8217;d had a hard time unlatching the restraints. Juliet Burton, tall and athletic, so sure of her own luck and agility that she hadn&#8217;t bothered, had been thrown into a strut.
The vent-blizzard of sulfur dioxide snow was blinding, though. It was only when Martha had finally crawled out from under its raging whiteness that she was able to look at the suited body she&#8217;d dragged free of the wreckage.
She immediately turned away.
Whatever knob or flange had punched the hole in Burton&#8217;s helmet had been equally ruthless with her head.
Where a fraction of the vent-blizzard&#8212;&#8220;lateral plumes&#8221; the planetary geologists called them&#8212;had been deflected by the boulder, a bank of sulfur dioxide snow had built up. Automatically, without thinking, Martha scooped up double-handfuls and packed them into the helmet. Really, it was a nonsensical thing to do; in a vacuum, the body wasn&#8217;t about to rot. On the other hand, it hid that face.
Then Martha did some serious thinking.
For all the fury of the blizzard, there was no turbulence. Because there was no atmosphere to have turbulence in. The sulfur dioxide gushed out straight from the sudden crack that had opened in the rock, falling to the surface miles away in strict obedience to the laws of ballistics. Most of what struck the boulder they&#8217;d crashed against would simply stick to it, and the rest would be bounced down to the ground at its feet. So that&#8212;this was how she&#8217;d gotten out in the first place&#8212;it was possible to crawl under the near-horizontal spray and back to the ruins of the moonrover. If she went slowly, the helmet light and her sense of feel ought to be sufficient for a little judicious salvage.
Martha got down on her hands and knees. And as she did, just as quickly as the blizzard had begun&#8212;it stopped.
She stood, feeling strangely foolish.
Still, she couldn&#8217;t rely on the blizzard staying quiescent. B[...]</ns2:summary>

Finished

What did I plan?&#160; Very little, in truth.&#160; An evening walk accompanied by the scent of flowers and dampened earth, the lingering heat of the day taken as a reassurance, ancient and holy.&#160; I was genuinely happy, as usual.&#160; Like a hundred other contented walkers, I wandered through the linear woods, past lovers&#8217; groves and pocket-sized sanctuaries and ornamental ponds jammed full of golden orfes and platinum lungfish.&#160; When I felt as if I should be tired, I sat on a hard steel bench to rest.&#160; People smiled as they passed, or they didn&#8217;t smile.&#160; But I showed everyone a wide grin, and sometimes I offered a pleasant word, and one or two of the strangers paused long enough to begin a brief conversation.
One man&#8212;a rather old man, and I remember little else&#8212;asked, &#8220;And how are you today?&#8221;
Ignoring the implication, I said, &#8220;Fine.&#8221;
I observed, &#8220;It&#8217;s a very pleasant evening.&#8221;
&#8220;Very pleasant,&#8221; he agreed.
My bench was near a busy avenue, and sometimes I would study one of the sleek little cars rushing past.
&#8220;The end of a wonderful day,&#8221; he continued.
I looked again at his soft face, committing none of it to memory.&#160; But I kept smiling, and with a tone that was nothing but polite, I remarked, &#8220;The sun&#8217;s setting earlier now.&#160; Isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
The banal recognition of a season&#8217;s progression&#8212;that was my only intent.&#160; But the face colored, and then with a stiff, easy anger, the man said, &#8220;What does it matter to you?&#160; It&#8217;s always the same day, after all.&#8221;
Hardly.&#160; Yet I said nothing.
He eventually grew tired of my silence and wandered off.&#160; With a memory as selective as it is graceful, I tried to forget him.&#160; But since I&#8217;m talking about him now, I plainly didn&#8217;t succeed.&#160; And looking back on the incident, I have to admit that the stranger perhaps had some little role in what happened next.
I planned nothing.
But a keen little anger grabbed me, and I rose up from the bench, and like every pedestrian before me, I followed the path to the edge of the avenue.&#160; Later, I was told that I looked like someone lost in deep thoughts, and I suppose I was.&#160; Yet I have no memory of the moment.&#160; According to witnesses, I took a long look up the road before stepping forwards with my right foot.&#160; The traffic AI stabbed my eyes with its brightest beam, shouting, &#8220;Go back!&#8221;&#160; But I stepped forwards again, without hesitation, plunging directly into the oncoming traffic.
A little pink Cheetah slammed on its brakes.&#160; But it was an old car with worn pads&#8212;a little detail that couldn&#8217;t have found its way into my calculations&#8212;and despite the heroic efforts of its AI pilot, the car was still moving at better than eighty kilometers an hour when it shattered my hip and threw my limp body across the hood, my chest and then my astonished face slamming into the windshield&#8217;s flexing glass.
Again, I tumbled.
Then I found myself sprawled in a heap on the hot pavement.
For a thousand years, I lay alone.&#160; Then a single face appeared, scared and sorry and pale and beautiful.&#160; Gazing down through the mayhem, she said, &#8220;Oh, God.&#160; Oh, shit!&#8221;
With my battered mouth, I said, &#8220;Hello.&#8221;
Leaking a sloppy laugh, I told her, &#8220;No, really, I&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221;
Then I asked, &#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;
&#8220;Careless,&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;Stupid,&#8221; she said.&#160; And then she said, &#8220;Or Bonnie.&#160; Take your pick.&#8221;
#
I picked Bonnie.
A beautiful young woman, she had short dark hair arranged in a fetching fish-scale pattern and a sweet face made with bright brown eyes and skin that looked too smooth and clear to be skin.&#160; On most occasions, her smile came easily, but it could be a crooked smile laced with weariness and a gentle sadness.&#160; There was a girlish lightness to her voice, but in difficult circumstances, that voice and the pretty face were capable of surprising strength.&#160; &#8220;What should I do?&#8221; she asked the crumbled figure at her feet.&#160; &#8220;What [...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Disney's &lt;i&gt;Oz the Great and Powerful&lt;/i&gt; was certainly an enjoyable movie, but it's rather like the Wizard himself from the 1939 version -- don't look behind the curtain, because there's a lot that doesn't work the way you expect it to.&lt;/p&gt;

I got an electronic copy of it about a year ago and really wanted to read it, but I've been busy. Lots of books to read. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;

PERSPECTIVE
By Jake Kerr
The worst part about picking my son up from the police station was the walk to get there. I hadn&#8217;t been outside in years, but it was still the same&#8211;the drab gray of the smog-stained overcast sky, the decaying concrete, the stench of gasoline, urine, and who knew what else. But thanks to Jeffrey there was a new assault to my senses&#8211;black molecular paint permanently defacing an already wretched city.With every step I could see his work&#8211;his &#8220;tags&#8221; as the police called them. They were all different, and there was no rhyme or reason as to what he would vandalize&#8211;the sides of buildings, street surfaces, retailer kiosks, even windows. The randomness made catching my son a difficult task for the police, but catch him they did, and now I had to walk these vile streets to bring him home.
I paid the bail, followed the directions to processing, and waited for my son. The policewoman there was polite and offered me a seat, but I stood. I wasn&#8217;t in the mood to relax, and Jeffrey needed to see how angry I was. So I waited, arms behind my back, staring at the door that led inside.
His head hung low as he walked out. He glanced up at me and then lowered his head again. &#8220;Hi, Pop,&#8221; he mumbled. I didn&#8217;t move. He walked over and added in a whisper, &#8220;I&#8217;m really sorry.&#8221;
&#8220;You lied to me.&#8221; I grabbed his right hand and pulled it up between us. &#8220;These black stains aren&#8217;t paint, Jeffrey. That is your _skin_. It was the price to pay for your job, you said. I&#8217;m painting ships with a new kind of paint, you said. You made the stains sound like a worthy sacrifice.&#8221; I tossed his hand down.
&#8220;Pop, please. Let&#8217;s talk about this at home.&#8221; He looked around the room, shifting from one foot to the other.
&#8220;Yes, we will discuss this at home.&#8221; I turned and walked out the door. He followed. I walked the streets again, Jeffrey shuffling behind me. I focused on the concrete at my feet, unable to bear looking at his work. My hands were clenched tight enough to turn my knuckles white, so I shoved them in my pockets.

###
I closed the door and set all the locks. I couldn&#8217;t remember the last time I had left the apartment for the drab world outside, and I did not intend to do it again. &#160;Jeffrey followed me in as I sat in my media chair and stood near the door. The distance felt greater than the span of a room. At least he was quiet and respectful. I sighed.
&#8220;The lies are what bother me the most, Jeffrey.&#8221;
He stiffened. &#8220;I never lied.&#8221;
I frowned and raised my voice. &#8220;You never lied? You said you were working at the shipyards!&#8221;
&#8220;I did work there. I painted ships.&#8221;
&#8220;Did you, now? Or were you defacing them in the middle of the night?&#8221; I pounded my hand on the arm of the chair. &#8220;I was sad, but I was still proud of you, Jeffrey. All those art lessons. All those awards. That you couldn&#8217;t make a living with your art broke me up inside. But to see you finally turn your art into industry, even if it required your hands to be stained that horrible coal black, that was a price I could at least understand. You were doing something meaningful.&#8221;
As I shook my head, he interjected, &#8220;I am doing something meaningful, Pop.&#8221; His voice rose. &#8220;You just don&#8217;t understand!&#8221;
&#8220;Painting permanent black marks across the city is not meaningful. This &#8216;tagging&#8217; that the police told me about. It&#8217;s a mark of pride, they said. A way for gangs and others to know that this is your city.&#8221; I closed my eyes and lowered my head. &#8220;I thought I had raised you better.&#8221;
&#8220;Pop, I wish I could explain, but I&#8217;m not done. When I am, you will understand.&#8221; He looked so earnest and so sad. I stared at him, and he lowered his head. Despite his hope, I knew I would never understand. How could I? He was marching off to scar the city again, and he expected me to just accept it. I couldn&#8217;t.
I stood up. &#8220;Not done? You[...]</ns2:summary>

Trixie and the Pandas of Dread
by Eugie Foster
Trixie got out of her cherry-red godmobile and waved away the flitting cherubim waiting to bear her to her sedan chair. She wasn&#8217;t in the mood for a reverent chorus of hosannas, and the sedan chair desperately needed re-springing. She felt every jostle and jounce from those damned pandas. A day didn&#8217;t pass that she didn&#8217;t regret adopting giant pandas as her sacred vahanas. Sure, it seemed like a good idea at the time. They were so cute with their roly-poly bellies and black-masked faces, but they were wholly unsuited to be beasts of conveyance. The excessive undulation of their waddling gaits was enough to make Captain Ahab seasick, and their exclusive diet of bamboo made them perpetually flatulent. The novelty of being hauled along by farting ursines in a stomach-roiling sedan chair had gotten very old very fast. But there wasn&#8217;t a lot she could do about it now. It was all about the brand. Pandas were part of her theology. If she adopted new vahanas, she&#8217;d likely end up with a splitter faction, possibly even a reformation. Such a pain in the ass.
So she&#8217;d started walking more&#8212;well, floating really, since gods weren&#8217;t supposed to tread the earth. Appearances and all.
Drifting a hairsbreadth above the pavement, Trixie pulled out her holy tablet and launched the Karmic Retribution app. The first thumbnail belonged to a Mr. Tom Ehler, the owner of the walkway and the two-story colonial house it led to. She unpinched two fingers across the screen to zoom up Mr. Ehler&#8217;s details.
Yesterday, Mr. Ehler, under the handle GodnessWins, had posted on a public forum a series of inflammatory comments in response to a YouTube video depicting a street fight. His sins were a nearly perfect fit for the specifications she&#8217;d told the app to flag, right down to the secondary parameters (Mr. Ehler&#8217;s toxic vitriol was also egregiously ungrammatical). But even reading, &#8220;yo n***rs, whiteman gave u freedom whiteman take it away&#8221; and &#8220;f**king street monkey deserved to get hang from a tree like the good old days,&#8221; only made Trixie feel tired. Where was the seething indignation? The fiery wrath and burning rage?
She knocked on the hardwood door, admiring the architecture as she waited. It was a pretty swank piece of real estate, red brick with whitewashed wooden trim. Definitely upscale.
The door opened at her fourth knock. The man glaring at her matched his profile headshot&#8212;receding hairline, thickening gut, age spots beginning to speckle his face&#8212;but she didn&#8217;t need the app to confirm his identity. Her omniscience had kicked in.
&#8220;What you want, missy? Knocking on decent people&#8217;s door this time of night?&#8221;
Trixie didn&#8217;t bother with any theatrical pyrotechnics or a &#8220;repent now&#8221; spiel. She just punched her fist into Tom Ehler&#8217;s chest and yanked out a handful of viscera. He collapsed, spraying blood and choking on his own bile. With disinterest, she watched him flail and shriek before calling down a white-hot levin bolt to finish him off.
She sighed. Yeah, it was still satisfying, ridding the world of another dickhead, but something was missing. Trixie had been a god for so long she barely remembered the time when she&#8217;d been mortal, just an earnest supplicant imploring the deities to smite sinners in the name of justice and an offended sense of _Why hasn&#8217;t this asshole been horribly maimed or engulfed in hellfire yet?_ She did remember her euphoric rapture when the Karma Committee appeared at her door with an oversized certificate of godhood and a bouquet of burning bushes. But she hadn&#8217;t felt anything but a plodding sense of duty for a long time.

I was so excited when I could finally buy a Tab. They cost so much, you know, but I saved up for maybe six months. I waitressed at Antonio&#8217;s in the North End, and let me tell you, it&#8217;s murder on the feet. &#160;Those trays are heavy, too, and Nico screams at everybody the whole shift, not to mention the way you smell after six hours. &#160;But the customers tip really well, and I was able to save up enough money, even after paying rent and stuff.
I could never have gotten a Tab when I was still married to Marc, that shit. &#160;He never liked anything I liked. &#160;When I married him, all I saw was the big brown eyes and the cleft in his chin and the way he could make his voice go down low, so that I felt it all the way down to my knees. &#160;I had to learn the hard way.
Not that I could&#8217;ve afforded a Tab back then, anyway. &#160;The price started coming down just a few years ago, about when Marc broke my front tooth. By that time I couldn&#8217;t go to my mom&#8217;s, because she said I always went back to that shit anyway, and she wasn&#8217;t going to help me do it again, and my friend Lila wouldn&#8217;t let me stay with her either, same reason. So I went to a shelter, and the police came, and we got a restraining order on Marc. &#160;But yeah, the same damn thing happened, he gave me that look with those eyes and told me how things were really, really going to change this time, because he&#8217;d seen the light and couldn&#8217;t believe he&#8217;d done something like that to me, and like an asshole, I dropped the charges and lifted the restraining order and went back to him.
Two years ago, right after I divorced Marc, Pearl Moulton started playing Mandi Trenton on _Dark Little Corners_, which was her first really big break, and they announced that there&#8217;d be a Tab on her. &#160;I wanted it as soon as I saw her on the show, because Mandi is so awesome; she&#8217;s this really tough girl who works in a bar, and she gives as good as she gets, and she never gives up on love when all these guys leave her all the time. And Pearl Moulton is so beautiful and talented; I used to watch her on _Deception_, when nobody paid her any attention. Now she was in all the magazines, and she&#8217;s exactly my age, and she was Tabbed.
But then my mom got sick, and I was taking care of her for two months. My brother Johnny didn&#8217;t do squat, and his wife Nadine, forget it. So I wasn&#8217;t able to get the Tab until she got better. &#160;That was last year, in May.
I got the injection and the ear cuff, went home and waited for Pearl Moulton&#8217;s Tab time, which was ten to twelve, Eastern. I was so excited I couldn&#8217;t sit down; I kept making cups of coffee and forgetting to drink them, picking up the _Herald_ and reading stuff I&#8217;d already read. Finally it was ten, and I sat down in the recliner and turned on the cuff.
First thing, while it was making the connection, it was like I didn&#8217;t have a body at all &#8212; no sight, no sound, no feeling, nothing. It&#8217;s a good thing your body breathes by itself, because I couldn&#8217;t even tell if I was. &#160;Then, all of a sudden, wham, I was in this padded chair, and I had Pearl Moulton&#8217;s body. She&#8217;s a lot thinner than I am, and her teeth are really straight, and you feel those things right away. At first there was no sound and I couldn&#8217;t see anything, but there was this sweet smell, and something soft brushing down over my face, that is, her face.
Then a girl&#8217;s voice said, &#8220;Okay, done,&#8221; and Pearl opened her eyes and blew out through her nose, like there was dust in it. &#160;She was sitting in a swivel chair in front of a big mirror like they have at a salon, with vanity bulbs all around it. &#160;In the mirror Pearl looked exactly like Mandi Trenton on _Dark [...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;A young woman stands on a subway platform. She turns to see another woman who looks just like her. The other woman steps off the platform into the path of an oncoming train. That's the first five minutes of &lt;i&gt;Orphan Black&lt;/i&gt;. What follows is science fiction. Kind of.&lt;/p&gt;

Cerbo un Vitra ujo
By Mary Robinette Kowal

Grete snipped a diseased branch off her Sunset-Glory rosebush like she was a body harvester looking for the perfect part. Behind the drone of the garden&#8217;s humidifiers, she caught a woosh-snick as the airlock door opened. Her boyfriend barreled around Mom&#8217;s prize Emperor artichoke.
Something was wrong.
The whites showed around Kaj&#8217;s remarkable eyes, a blue-green so iridescent they seemed to dull all the plants around them. &#8220;Mom and Dad got me a Pass to a down-planet school!&#8221;
The blood congealed in her veins. Kaj would leave her. Grete forced a smile. &#8220;That&#8217;s the outer limit!&#8221;
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t even know they&#8217;d applied. Fairview Academy&#8212;game design.&#8221; His perfect teeth flashed like sunshine against the ink of space.
&#8220;It&#8217;s wacking crazed. Should&#8217;ve been you, you&#8217;re a better hack than me.&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;m already entitled to school.&#8221; Grete winced as the words left her mouth. Like he didn&#8217;t know that. He was the middle of five children, way past the Banwith Station family allowance. She picked up the pruning sheers to hide the shake in her hands. How would she live without Kaj? &#8220;So, I guess you got packing to do and stuff.&#8221;
&#8220;They provide uniforms. All I&#8217;m taking is my pod with music and books. Zero else.&#8221; Kaj slid his arm around her waist and laced his long, delicate fingers through hers. &#8220;And I want to spend every moment till launch with you.&#8221;
She loved him so much, it hurt. Grete leaned her head against him, burning the feel of his body into her memory. She breathed in the musky smell of his sweat and kissed his neck, sampling the salt on his skin.
After a moment, Kaj hung a chain around her neck. The metal tags hanging from it were still warm from his body.
&#8220;What?&#8221;
&#8220;Dogtags, like they used in the oldwars. I put all my bios on there so you&#8217;d remember me.&#8221;
&#8220;Kaj Lorensen, don&#8217;t think I could forget you.&#8221;
But if he was away at school, he might forget her. She studied her rosebush and freed the most perfect rose with her sheers. She held it out to him, suddenly shy.
He kissed the rose and then her palm. Grete sank into his gaze, lost in the blue-green of his eyes.
#
Grete buzzed the Lorensen cubby and waited as the comunit scanned her retina for i.d. If her mom knew how to hack into scanner records,&#160; Grete would get major grief for skipping school, but she couldn&#8217;t stand the waiting anymore. Around her, the kids who weren&#8217;t entitled to school played a game of tag in the corridor. She watched to see if any of Kaj&#8217;s younger sibs were there.
The door hissed open. Kaj&#8217;s mother, belly starting to round with another pregnancy, glared at Grete. &#8220;What.&#8221;
&#8220;Sorry, the address I have for Kaj doesn&#8217;t respond.&#8221; A month. She&#8217;d pinged him and waited. Pinged his mom, and waited. She&#8217;d even asked the counselor at her school, but he had never even heard of Fairview Academy. Grete was tired of waiting.
Ms. Lorensen&#8217;s eyes were as flat and grey as her voice. &#8220;You leave him alone. You want to mess this up for him?&#8221;
&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am. I just miss him.&#8221;
&#8220;Maybe he doesn&#8217;t miss you.&#8221; The door hissed shut. Grete stared at the mute door for a moment, and then started looking for Kaj&#8217;s sibs, hoping they would know how to contact him. The older two would be in school, which was where Grete should be, but Kaj&#8217;s younger sibs were not entitled.
On any other station, no parent in their right mind would let their unentitled kids run free, for fear they&#8217;d be taken by a body harvester on a job for some rich-ass client. Banwith Stat[...]</ns2:summary>

Bill started voice acting on the Metamor City Podcast, and has wanted to do more ever since.&#160; He spends his days working at a library, where he is in charge of all things with plugs and troubleshooting the people who use them.&#160; He spends his nights with his wife, two active children, and two overly active canines and all that goes with that.






Making My Entrance Again With My Usual Flair
by Ken Scholes


No one ever asks a clown at the end of his life what he really wanted to be when he grew up. It&#8217;s fairly obvious. No one gets hijacked into the circus. We race to it, the smell of hotdogs leading us in, our fingers aching for the sticky pull of taffy, the electric shock of pink cotton on our tongue. Ask a lawyer and he&#8217;ll say when he was a kid he wanted to be an astronaut. Ask an accountant; he&#8217;ll say he wanted to be fireman.
I am a clown. I have always wanted to be a clown. And I will die a clown if I have my way.
My name is Merton D. Kamal.
The Kamal comes from my father. I never met the man so I have no idea how he came by it. Mom got the Merton bit from some monk she used to read who wrote something like this: We learn humility by being humiliated often. Given how easily (and how frequently) Kamal is pronounced Camel, and given how the D just stands for D, you can see that she wanted her only child to be absolutely filled to the brim with humility.
My Mom is a deeply spiritual woman.
But enough about her. This is my story.
&#8220;Merton,&#8221; the ringmaster and owner Rufus P. Stowell said, &#8220;it&#8217;s just not working out.&#8221;
I was pushing forty. I&#8217;d lost some weight and everyone knows kids love a chubby clown. I&#8217;d also taken up drinking which didn&#8217;t go over well right before a show. So suddenly, I found myself without prospects and I turned myself towards home, riding into Seattle by bus on a cold November night.
Mom met me at the bus stop. She had no business driving but she came out anyway. She was standing on the sidewalk next to the station wagon when she saw me. We hugged.
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re home,&#8221; she said.
I lifted my bag into the back. &#8220;Thanks.&#8221;
&#8220;Are you hungry?&#8221;
&#8220;Not really.&#8221;
We went to Denny&#8217;s anyway. Whenever my Mom wanted to talk, we went to Denny&#8217;s. It&#8217;s where she took me to tell me about boys and girls, it&#8217;s where she took me to tell me that my dog had been hit by a car.
&#8220;So what are you going to do now?&#8221; She cut and speared a chunk of meatloaf, then dipped it into her mashed potatoes and gravy before raising it to her mouth.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll fatten up, quit drinking, get back into the business.&#8221; I watched her left eyebrow twitch&#8212;a sure sign of disapproval. I hefted my double bacon cheeseburger, then paused. &#8220;Why? What do you think I should do?&#8221;
She leaned forward. She brought her wrinkled hand u[...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;If you came across a classified ad saying you could go back in time as long as you bring your own weapons, would you apply? Or would you write it off as a crackpot's attempt to involve you in a conspiracy?

Lois McMaster Bujold was born 2 November 1949 in Columbus, Ohio. She attended Ohio State University from 1968 to 1972, but didn&#8217;t graduate.

Then in one glorious moment, Baen bought all three of the novels she had already written. All three were published in 1986.She has won four Hugo awards in the Novel category, more than any other writer except for Robert A Heinlein, (excluding his Retro Hugo) and yet many SF readers have never heard of her!Lois was on the Locus Recommended Reading list with&#160;Falling Free,&#160;Brothers In Arms,&#160;Mountains of Mourning,&#160;Labyrinth,&#160;Barrayar&#160;and&#160;Mirror Dance.

About the Author&#8230;

(taken from http://www.johnjosephadams.com/brave-new-worlds/table-of-contents/red-card-s-l-gilbow/) S. L. Gilbow is a relatively new writer, with five stories published to date, four inThe Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&#160;and one in [the] anthology&#160;Federations.Gilbow served twenty-six years in the Air Force, and has been on dozens of deployments, and has flown more than 2000 hours as a B-52 navigator. He currently makes his living by teaching English at a public high school in Norfolk, Virginia.
Everyone knows that James Bond has a &#8220;license to kill.&#8221;&#160; As an international spy, he must sometimes fight for his life. But he&#8217;s a trained government employee, specially selected for Her Majesty&#8217;s Service.&#160; But could you trust just&#160;anyone&#160;with a license to kill?
What about your neighbor?
Or your boss?
In fact, what if the government gave everybody one free pass to shoot one person,any person, for whatever reason?
That&#8217;s the premise of [this] story.&#160; S. L. Gilbow says that the idea for &#8220;Red Card&#8221; actually came from a conversation he had with his daughter, Mandy.&#160; &#8220;One day after a driver cut me off in heavy traffic, I&#8230; turned to my daughter and said, &#8216;Everyone should be allowed to shoot one person without going to prison.&#8217; My daughter thought for a second then turned to me and said, &#8216;Dad, if that were true you would have been dead a long time ago.&#8217;&#8221;



About the Narrator&#8230;
&#8220;I may not be perfectly wise, perfectly witty, or perfectly wonderful, but I am always perfectly me.&#8221; Anonymous

The best part of my life is being Bill&#8217;s wife. I&#8217;m a horticulturist by trade, current stay at home mom for two children, team mom for the local Goalball team, and advocate for Blind/Visually Impaired causes and adoption causes. I love D20 gaming, reading, camping and canoeing, card playing, and music.






Red Card
by S.L. Gilbow
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Late one April evening, Linda Jackson pulled a revolver from her purse and shot her husband through a large mustard stain in the center of his T-shirt. &#160;The official after incident survey concluded that almost all of Merry Valley approved of the shooting. &#160;Sixty-four percent of the townspeople even rated her target selection as &#8220;excellent.&#8221; &#160;A few, however, criticized her, pointing out that shooting your husband is &#8220;a little too obvious&#8221; and &#8220;not very creative.&#8221;
Dick Andrews, who had farmed the fertile soil around Merry Valley for over thirty years, believed that Larry Jackson, more than anyone else in town, needed to be killed. &#160;&#8220;I never liked him much,&#8221; he wrote in the additional comments section of the incident survey. &#160;&#8220;He never seemed to have a good word to say about anybody.&#8221;
&#8220;Excellent use of a bullet,&#8221; scrawled Jimmy Blanchard. &#160;Born and raised in Merry Valley, he had known Larry for years and had even graduated from high school with him. &#160;&#8220;Most overbearing person I&#8217;ve ever met. &#160;He deserved what he got. &#160;I&#8217;m just not sure why it took so long.&#8221;
Of course, a few people made waves. &#160;Jenny Collins seemed appalled. &#160;&#8220;I can hardly believe it,&#8221; she wrote. &#160;&#8220;We used to be much more discerning about who we killed, and we certainly didn&#8217;t go around flaunting it the way Linda does.&#8221; &#160;Jenny was the old-fashioned kind.
Linda would never have called her actions &#8220;flaunting it.&#8221; &#160;Of course she knew what to do after shooting Larry. &#160;She had read The Enforcement Handbook from cover to cover six times, poring over it to see if she had missed anything, scrutinizing every nuance. &#160;She had even committed some of the more important passages to memory: &#160;Call the police immediately after executing an enforcement&#8211;Always keep your red card in a safe, dry place&#8211;Never reveal to anyone that you have a red card&#8211;Be proud; you&#8217;re performing an important civic duty.
But flaunting it? &#160;No, Lind[...]</ns2:summary>

About the Author&#8230;

I&#8217;ve worked as a programmer and as a lawyer, and the two professions are surprisingly similar. In both, one extra level of indirection solves most problems.
I write speculative fiction and poetry. Occasionally, I also translate Chinese fiction into English.
My wife,&#160;Lisa Tang Liu, is an artist. I&#8217;m working on a novel set in a universe we came up with together.
Things I like: pure Lisp, clever Perl, tight C; well-designed products, the Red Sox; sentences that sound perfect in only one language; math proofs that I can hold in my head; novels that make me quiver; poems that make me sing; arguments that aren&#8217;t hypocritical; old clothes, old friends, new ideas.
Labels that fit with various degrees of accuracy: American, Chinese; Christian, Daoist, Confucian; populist, contrarian, skeptic, libertarian (small &#8220;l&#8221;); a liminal provincial in America, the New Rome.



About the Narrator&#8230;
John designs microprocessors by day and writes fiction by night. His work has been published at Boston Review, Asimov&#8217;s and Tor.com. His website is http://johnchu.net







Good Hunting
by Ken Liu
Night. Half moon. An occasional hoot from an owl. The merchant and his wife and all the servants had been sent away. The large house was eerily quiet. Father and I crouched behind the scholar&#8217;s rock in the courtyard. Through the rock&#8217;s many holes I could see the bedroom window of the merchant&#8217;s son. &#8220;Oh, Tsiao-jung, my sweet Tsiao-jung&#8230;&#8221; The young man&#8217;s feverish groans were pitiful. Half-delirious, he was tied to his bed for his own good, but Father had left a window open so that his plaintive cries could be carried by the breeze far over the rice paddies. &#8220;Do you think she really will come?&#8221; I whispered. Today was my thirteenth birthday, and this was my first hunt.
&#8220;She will,&#8221; Father said. &#8220;A _hulijing_ cannot resist the cries of the man she has bewitched.&#8221;
&#8220;Like how the Butterfly Lovers cannot resist each other?&#8221; I thought back to the folk opera troupe that had come through our village last fall.
&#8220;Not quite,&#8221; Father said. But he seemed to have trouble explaining why. &#8220;Just know that it&#8217;s not the same.&#8221;
I nodded, not sure I understood. But I remembered how the merchant and his wife had come to Father to ask for his help.
_&#8221;How shameful!&#8221; The merchant had muttered. &#8220;He&#8217;s not even nineteen. How could he have read so many sages&#8217; books and still fall under the spell of such a creature?&#8221;_
_&#8221;There&#8217;s no shame in being entranced by the beauty and wiles of a _hulijing_,&#8221; Father had said. &#8220;Even the great scholar Wong Lai once spent three nights in the company of one, and he took first place at the Imperial Examinations. Your son just needs a little help.&#8221;_
_&#8221;You must save him,&#8221; the merchant&#8217;s wife had said, bowing like a chicken pecking at rice. &#8220;If this gets out, the matchmakers won&#8217;t touch him at all.&#8221;_
A _hulijing_ was a demon who stole hearts. I shuddered, worried if I would have the courage to face one.
Father put a warm hand on my shoulder, and I felt calmer. In his hand was Swallow Tail, a sword that had first been forged by our ancestor, General Lau Yip, thirteen generations ago. The sword was charged with hundreds of Daoist blessings and had drunk the blood of countless demons.
A passing cloud obscured the moon for a moment, throwing everything into darkness.
When the moon emerged again, I almost cried out.
There, in the courtyard, was the most beautiful lady I had ever seen.
She had on a flowing white silk dress with billowing sleeves and a wide, silvery belt. Her face was pale as snow, and her hair dark as coal, draping past her waist. I thought[...]</ns2:summary>

Robot

You may wash your aluminum chassis on Monday and leave it on the back porch opposite the recyclables; you may wash your titanium chassis on Friday if you promise to polish it in time for church; don&#8217;t terrorize the cat; don&#8217;t lose the pamphlets my husband has brought home from the hospital; they suggest I give you a name, do you like Fred?; don&#8217;t eat the dead flesh of my right foot until after I have fallen asleep and cannot hear the whir of your incisors working against the bone.
This is a picture of the world from which you were sent; this is a copy of the agreement between our government and theirs; these are the attributes they claim you are possessed of: obedience, loyalty, low to moderate intelligence; a natural curiosity which I should not mistake for something other than a necessary facet of your survival in the unfamiliar; this is your bill of manufacture; this is your bill of sale; this is a warrant of merchantability on which I may rely should I decide to return you from whence you came; this is your serial number, here, scraped in an alien script on the underside of your knee; the pamphlets say you may be of the mind to touch it occasionally, like a name-tag, but if I command you, you will stop.
This is a list of the chores you will be expected to complete around the house when you are not eating the diseases out of my flesh; this is the corner of my room where you may stay when you are not working; do not look at me when you change the linens, when you must hold me in the bathroom, when you record in the notebook how many medications I have had that day, how many bowel movements, how the flesh of my mouth is raw and bleeding against the dentures I insist on wearing.
The pamphlets say you are the perfect scavenger: completely self contained, no digestion, no waste; they say I can hook you up to an outlet and you will power the whole house.
You may polish the silver if you are bored; you may also rearrange the furniture, wind the clocks, pull weeds from the garden; you may read in the library any book of your choosing; my husband claims you have no real consciousness, only an advanced and sophisticated set of pre-programmed responses, but I have seen your eyes open in the middle of the night; I have seen you stare out across the fields as if there is something there, calling you.
Cook my meals in butter, I will not eat them otherwise; do not speak to the neighbors; do not speak to my children, they are not yours; do not let anyone see you when I open the door for the mail; no, there is nothing for you, who even knows that you are here?

About the Author&#8230;

A firm believer in the &#8220;apply butt to chair, then fingers to keyboard&#8221; philosophy, Ferrett Steinmetz writes for at least an hour every day &#8211; which helps, he promises. He is a graduate of both the Clarion Writers&#8217; Workshop and Viable Paradise, and has been nominated for the Nebula Award, for which he remains stoked.
Ferrett has a moderately popular blog, The Watchtower of Destruction, wherein he talks about bad puns, relationships, politics, videogames, and more bad puns. He is the creator of the most popular and comprehensive online purity quizzes (this one&#8217;s for sex, but he&#8217;s also done them for roleplaying and Livejournal). He&#8217;s written four computer books, including the still-popular-after-two-years Wicked Cool PHP.
He lives in Cleveland with his wife, who he couldn&#8217;t imagine living without.



About the Narrator&#8230;
Kathy&#160;Sherwood&#160;resides in a (probably only figuratively) magical forest in North Central Florida, with her significant other, two dogs and two cats. &#160;She also hosts alternative rock show&#160;Not Quite Random&#160;on 88.5 WFCF&#8211;Flagler College Radio.





Dead Merchandise
by Ferrett Steinmetz
The ad-faeries danced around Sheryl, flickering cartoon holograms with fluoride-white smiles. They told her the gasoline that sloshed in the red plastic canister she held was high-octane, perfect for any vehicle, did she want to go for a drive?
She did not. That gasoline was for burning. Sheryl patted her pockets to make sure the matches were still there and kept moving forward, blinking away the videostreams. Her legs ached.
She squinted past a flurry of hair-coloring ads (&#8220;Sheryl, wash your gray away today!&#8221;), scanning the neon roads to find the breast-shaped marble dome of River Edge&#8217;s central collation unit. River&#8217;s Edge had been a sleepy Midwestern town when she was a girl, a place just big enough for a diner and a department store. Now River&#8217;s Edge had been given a mall-over like every other town &#226;&#8364;&#8221; every wall lit up with billboards, colorful buildings topped with projectors to burn logos into the clouds. She was grateful for the dark patches that marked where garish shop-fronts had been bombed into ash-streaked metal tangles.
The smoke gave her hope. Others were trying to bring it all down &#226;&#8364;&#8221; and if they were succeeding, maybe no one was left to stop her.
Rotting bodies leered out at her through car windows, where computer-guided cars had smashed headlong into the collapsed shopfronts that had fallen into the road. Had the drivers been fleeing, or trying to destroy the collation unit? She had no idea.
The ad-faeries sang customized praises to each auto as she glanced at the cars, devising customized ditties about the &#8217;59 Breezster&#8217;s speed. Sheryl needed speed; at her arthritic pace, walking through the women&#8217;s district might tempt her into submission.
Given that the ad-faeries suggested it, driving was a terrible idea. River&#8217;s Edge had been so gutted by bombings that she&#8217;d have to drive manually &#226;&#8364;&#8221; and it was already hard to see through the foggy blur of chirping ad-faeries, each triangulating her cornea&#8217;s focal point to obscure her vision for the legal limit of .8 seconds. They elbowed each other aside, proffering chewy pomegranate cookies, diamond-edged razors, laser-guided wall-bots that would paint her house a new color every day.
She had no use for them. She&#8217;d burned her house down, leaving Rudy&#8217;s body underneath the pile of engraved stones with her sons&#8217; names on them.
She had to pass through the two main shopping districts to destroy the collation center at River&#8217;s Edge &#226;&#8364;&#8221; and if she did that, then she could free Oakmoor, then Daleton, and then who knows where? &#160;But they&#8217;d kill her if she weakened.
Sheryl clutched the gasoline canister to her chest as she maneuv[...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;So, as if you didn't know, I'm a huge &lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt; fan. It was pretty much a foregone conclusion that I was going to see &lt;i&gt;Star Trek Into Darkness&lt;/i&gt; on opening weekend. Since my birthday was the same weekend as the opening, it was like J.J. Abrams himself gave me a present.&lt;/p&gt;

About the Author&#8230;

borrowed from&#160;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Sprague_de_Camp
Lyon Sprague de Camp&#160;(November 27, 1907 &#8211; November 6, 2000) was an&#160;American&#160;writer of&#160;science fiction&#160;and&#160;fantasy,&#160;non-fiction&#160;and&#160;biography. In a career spanning 60 years, he wrote over 100 books, including novels and notable works of non-fiction, including biographies of other important fantasy authors. He &#8220;was widely regarded as an imaginative and innovative writer and was an important figure in the heyday of science fiction, from the late 1930s through the late 1940s.&#8221;



About the Narrator&#8230;

Ayoub Khote is a professional geek, a writer, a photographer, and a man with a voice others seem to like, even though he really can&#8217;t stand the sound of it. Ayoub&#8217;s d&#233;but is with HG World, but he is also working on a smaller production, oddly enough also with a Scots accent, even though he&#8217;s a born Londoner!



A Gun for Dinosaur
by L. Sprague de Camp



NOTE: Also available is the X-1 production of the story available on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7edFWC-120
No, I&#8217;m sorry, Mr. Seligman, but I can&#8217;t take you hunting Late Mesozoic dinosaur.
Yes, I know what the advertisement says.
Why not? How much d&#8217;you weigh? A hundred and thirty? Let&#8217;s see; that&#8217;s under ten stone, which is my lower limit.
I could take you to other periods, you know. I&#8217;ll take you to any period in the Cenozoic. I&#8217;ll get you a shot at an entelodont or a uintathere. They&#8217;ve got fine heads.
I&#8217;ll even stretch a point and take you to the Pleistocene, where you can try for one of the mammoths or the mastodon.
I&#8217;ll take you back to the Triassic where you can shoot one of the smaller ancestral dinosaurs. But I will jolly well not take you to the Jurassic or Cretaceous. You&#8217;re just too small.
What&#8217;s your size got to do with it? Look here, old boy, what did you think you were going to shoot your dinosaur with?
Oh, you hadn&#8217;t thought, eh?
Well, sit there a minute . . . Here you are: my own private gun for that work, a Continental .600. Does look like a shotgun, doesn&#8217;t it? But it&#8217;s rifled, as you can see by looking through the barrels. Shoots a pair of .600 Nitro Express cartridges the size of bananas; weighs fourteen and a half pounds and has a muzzle energy of over seven thousand foot-pounds. Costs fourteen hundred and fifty dollars. Lot of money for a gun, what?
I have some spares I rent to the sahibs. Designed for knocking down elephant. Not just wounding them, knocking them base-over-apex. That&#8217;s why they don&#8217;t make guns like this in America, though I suppose they will if hunting parties keep going back in time.
Now, I&#8217;ve been guiding hunting parties for twenty years. Guided &#8216;em in Africa until the game gave out there except on the preserves. And all that time I&#8217;ve never known a man your size who could handle the six-nought-nought. It knocks &#8216;em over, and even when they stay on their feet they get so scared of the bloody cannon after a few shots that they flinch. And they find the gun too heavy to drag around rough Mesozoic country. Wears &#8216;em out.
It&#8217;s true that lots of people have killed elephant with lighter guns: the .500, .475, and .465 doubles, for instance, or even the .375 magnum repeaters. The difference is, with a .375 you have to hit something vital, preferably the heart, and can&#8217;t depend on simple shock power.
An elephant weighs&#8211;let&#8217;s see&#8211;four to six tons. You&#8217;re proposing to shoot reptiles weighing two or three times as much as an elephant and with much greater tenacity of life. That&#8217;s why the syndicate decided to take no more people dinosaur hunting unless they could handle the .60[...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Edgar Allan Poe was a well-known American poet and writer, but it's still not known exactly what caused his death in 1849 at age 40. The film &lt;i&gt;The Raven&lt;/i&gt; attempts to explain that. Also, there's a serial killer. (I didn't say it made sense.)&lt;/p&gt;

About the Author&#8230;

from the author&#8217;s website (linked above)
&#8220;I used to live in California, until I got tired of how it never snowed and moved to Boston. I currently live in New Haven with my husband and two cats. (I do miss the earthquakes, though. The little ones, anyhow.)
I have a PhD in planetary science and have worked on extrasolar planets and objects in the outer solar system. I am currently an &#8220;Astronomer-at-large&#8221;, which is another word for &#8220;not being paid&#8221;. (I have a couple of papers I&#8217;m wrapping up and a grant proposal pending.) I also&#160;write. In my spare time, I go on trips, take pretty pictures, and then neglect to update my webpage for years at a time.&#8221;

Subversion
by Elisabeth R. Adams



I knew, by his crossed arms, the way he rolled his eyes at himself, and particularly by the pale translucence of all three of him, that I was looking at a classic case of version conflict.
&#8220;I said stay away from her,&#8221; said one I decided to call Art. Nicknames help. Thick square rims, a jaunty fedora, a crisp T-shirt for a concert by a band that broke up before he hit preschool. He was yelling at a paler self in a white collared shirt and slacks. They were trailed by a bored looking him in sunglasses.
&#8220;What seems to be the problem, sir?&#8221; I asked. Rule number one: stick to the singular.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t get him to commit,&#8221; said Slacks.
I scanned his chip. Eduardo Martin, 34, programmer. No spouse or kids, but adoption records from the county shelter for two cats. Sealed tax records, a social security number, mortgage history. Subversion Inc. member for five years, currently version 4.1. Definitely the primary.
&#8220;And your subversion?&#8221;
Art glared at Eduardo, but extended his arm. Eduardo Martin, 34, barista. Same social security number. A different home address. And, most intriguingly, he was listed as version 1.0.
&#8220;You see?&#8221; said Eduardo.
&#8220;Let me check.&#8221; I ran through Art&#8217;s commit log. &#8220;Says you branched off from 2.5, hmm, two years ago. That&#8217;s a bit long. Company policy recommends no more than six months between full reconciles. Probably caused some glitch in the occupation and version number.&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s not a glitch,&#8221; said Art. &#8220;I want to apply for Emancipated Branch status.&#8221;
&#8220;No, no, no,&#8221; said Eduardo. He flailed his arms and paced. He looked even paler up close[...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the furor over the reboot universe and the sci-fi landscape's love for the later iterations of Star Trek, there's still something about The Original Series that keeps bringing people back. And one way they come back is with fan films. The latest is "Pilgrim of Eternity" from &lt;i&gt;Star Trek Continues&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

About the Author&#8230;

from the author&#8217;s website (linked above)
I am a software engineer and&#160;writer, happily married and living in Chicago with my wife, two kids and one nuisance cat. I have a B.S. in Computer Science from Purdue University, and a Masters of Software Engineering from Penn State. In addition to Chicago, I have lived in Fort Wayne, IN and Philadelphia, PA.
I have been accused of being obsessed with pirates, bacon, zombies and my kids (not necessarily in that order). I&#8217;m a knitter, guitar player, budding accordionista, board and card game enthusiast, as well as an avid reader of science fiction, fantasy, and horror.



About the Narrator&#8230;

Christina Lebonville is known by the online moniker, Evil Cheshire Cat, a tribute to her sense of sarcastically dark humor and toothy resemblance to the re-imagining of the classic Wonderland character in American McGee&#8217;s video game, Alice. She has done voice work and writing for skits and songs played on the now retired comedy podcast, The Awful Show, and is the co-creator and former co-host of the podcast Obviously Oblivious, a nearly four-year running comedy podcast with a science twist. Christina has since retired from podcasting to pursue a doctorate in Behavioral Neuroscience.




My Heart is a Quadratic Equation
by Shane Halbach
I. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Brian
&#8220;So, uh, Chrysanthemum, what do you do?&#8221;
&#8220;Science. You know&#8230;science stuff. I&#8217;m a scientist.&#8221;
&#8220;That&#8217;s&#8230;not very specific.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s kind of hard to explain,&#8221; said Chrysanthemum. In words you&#8217;d understand she added to herself.
She used the lull in the conversation to take a pen out of her pocket. Idly she doodled the inside of a hydrogen-powered rocket on a spare cocktail napkin. It was a nice restaurant, she&#8217;d give him that. He&#8217;d even ordered wine. Big spender. She added an extra fin to her schematic, for stability.
He broke the silence. &#8220;Chrysanthemum is an unusual name.&#8221;
&#8220;The Chrysanthemum is in the Asteraceae family and has been cultivated in Japan for over 2,000 years.&#8221;
Brian coughed and looked down at the table, quiet once more.
Turn off the mouth, she thought, this is not how normal people talk.
She stole quick glances at him, her eyes flicking back and forth between his face and the pen in her hand. He was clean cut, with short brown hair. By the way it was carefully styled, she guessed he didn&#8217;t keep it short for the convenience, the way she kept her own black hair short. He was taller than she was, but then she was petite. His nose was a bit on the large side, but at least he seemed nice. It would probably be an adequate genetic pairing, if she didn&#8217;t mind inane small talk.
He took a breath and waded in again.
&#8220;Have you always lived in the city?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied glumly. This is intolerable. How do people do this?
This time the silence stretched on and on, like time in a black hole as it approached singularity. Her mind groped for something to say.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve created a nuclear-based energy weapon,&#8221; she blurted out.
Brian raised his hand.
&#8220;Check please!&#8221;
###
&#8220;Chyrs, honey, you just need to relax a little bit! Let things happen naturally.&#8221;
&#8220;Mother, you know I hate it when you call me that. And I&#8217;m trying!&#8221;
&#8220;You&#8217;re a smart, capable young lady, who can do anything if she puts her mind to it. But you&#8217;re certainly not going to find someone in those Petri dishes of yours.&#8221;
Don&#8217;t I know it, thought Chrysanthemum. A small change in one gene has unintended consequences throughout the entire genome. Perhaps if I could just understand the structure of the&#8230;
&#8220;Don&#8217;t let it bother you, sweetie. If at first you don&#8217;t succeed, try, try again!&#8221;
&#8220;Listen, let&#8217;s just drop it. How&#8217;s father?&#8221;
&#8220;He&#8217;s wonderful dear. The folks at Sunny Outlook are just so good to him. Listen, remember that time you shut off the power grid for half of the[...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;There's a reason &lt;i&gt;The Phantom Tollbooth&lt;/i&gt; is a classic. Adults will appreciate the humor. Parents will appreciate the lesson the book teaches their kids. Kids will appreciate the fantastical elements and the way that the hero manages to work stuff out more and more the farther into the book they go. &lt;/p&gt;

About the Author&#8230;

from IMDB.com
Arthur C. Clarke was born in the seaside town of Minehead, Somerset, England in December 16, 1917. In 1936 he moved to London, where he joined the British Interplanetary Society. There he started to experiment with astronautic material in the BIS, write the BIS Bulletin and science fiction. During World War II, as a RAF officer, he was in charge of the first radar talk-down equipment during its experimental trials. His only non-science-fiction novel, Glide Path, is based on this work. After the war, he returned to London and to the BIS, which he presided in 46-47 and 50-53. In 1945 he published the technical paper &#8220;Extra-terrestrial Relays&#8221; laying down the principles of the satellite com- communication with satellites in geostationary orbits &#8211; a speculation realized 25 years later. His invention has brought him numerous prestigious honors. Today, the geostationary orbit at 36,000 kilometers is named The Clarke Orbit by the International Astronomical Union. The first story Clarke sold professionally was &#8220;Rescue Party&#8221;, written in March 1945 and appearing in Astounding Science in May 1946. He obtained first class honors in Physics and Mathematics at the King&#8217;s College, London, in 1948.
In 1953 he met an American named Marilyn Torgenson, and married her less than three weeks later. They split in December 1953. As Clarke says, &#8220;The marriage was incompatible from the beginning. It was sufficient proof that I wasn&#8217;t the marrying type, although I think everybody should marry once&#8221;. Clarke first visited Colombo, Sri Lanka (at the time called Ceylon) in December 1954. In 1954 Clarke wrote to Dr Harry Wexler, then chief of the Scientific Services Division, U.S. Weather Bureau, about satellite applications for weather forecasting. Of these communications, a new branch of meteorology was born, and Dr. Wexler became the driving force in using rockets and satellites for meteorological research and operations. In 1954 Clarke started to give up space for the sea. About the reasons, he said: &#8220;I now realise that it was my interest in astronautics that led me to the ocean. Both involve exploration, of course &#8211; but that&#8217;s not the only reason. When the first skin-diving equipment started to appear in the late 1940s, I suddenly realized that here was a cheap and simple way of imitating one of the most magical aspects of spaceflight &#8211; weightessness.&#8221; In the book Profiles of the Future (1962) he looks at the probable shape of tomorrow&#8217;s world. In this book he states his three Laws: 1.&#8221;When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.&#8221; 2.&#8221;The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.&#8221; 3.&#8221;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&#8221; In 1964, he started to work with Stanley Kubrick in a SF movie script. After 4 years, he shared an Oscar Academy Award nomination with him for the film version of 2001: A Space Odyssey. He co-broadcasted the Apollo 11 , 12 and 15 missions with Walter Cronkite and Wally Schirra for CBS. In 1985, He published a s[...]</ns2:summary>

Growing Up Human
By Claudine Griggs

One historical film character slapped another who was snoring.&#160; &#8220;Wake up and go to sleep!&#8221;
Jonathan laughed and signaled a replay.
Slap.&#160; &#8220;Wake up and go to sleep!&#8221;
Again Jonathan laughed.
Betty entered the recreational living area of their home.&#160; &#8220;Are you still watching that waste of energy?&#160; Please turn it off.&#8221;
&#8220;All right, Mother.&#160; How long before I can re-engage?&#8221;
Betty did a rough calculation.&#160; &#8220;Five-point-seven-six hours because you have an afternoon project.&#160; Macro-hermeneutic heteromorphic psychology of the pre-apocalyptic social democracies followed by the intercontinental Maslowvian identity regressions of 2080-2095, leading to the failed survivalist era and extinction.&#160; Multiple volumes to upload, cross-reference, and consider.&#160; Then there&#8217;s replicated lawn care with a petrochemical mower dating from 2013&#226;&#8364;&#8221;very dirty.&#160; And,&#8221; she searched for appropriate parental terminology, &#8220;I want you to clean that room of yours.&#160; It&#8217;s starting to look like a pigpen, pigsty, or other unattractive pig place.&#8221;
&#8220;Awh, gee, Mom!&#8221;
Betty appreciated the skilled inflection.
&#8220;Is dinner included in the estimate?&#8221; asked Jonathan.
&#8220;Negative.&#160; Our morning uploads call for meal functions every fourth day, supplemented with biweekly nutra-packs.&#8221;&#160; Betty smiled.&#160; &#8220;We have mastered comestible etiquette, and dining rituals are being phased out.&#8221;
&#8220;Wow!&#8221; said Jonathan.&#160; &#8220;That&#8217;s,&#8221; he skipped a pulse, &#8220;a psychedelic soul train.&#8221;
Betty looked concerned.&#160; &#8220;Are your linguistic filters functioning properly?&#8221;
Jonathan scanned.&#160; &#8220;Yes, but the younger generations sometimes combined words, especially adjectives and explicatives, and embellished them with coded meanings.&#160; Yesterday I studied 1960s Southern California jargon, which seems to include a fascinating, discrete language for teenagers that was apparently stimulated by too much ultraviolet sunlight.&#160; But their dialects are almost fun.&#8221;
&#8220;Fun?&#8221; asked Betty.&#160; This had real potential.&#160; &#8220;Please translate.&#160; Be specific.&#8221;
Jonathan paused, nearly admitting that the Mother Figure had caught him bragging.&#160; &#8220;It might be easier to demonstrate, Mom.&#8221;
&#8220;Proceed.&#8221;
&#8220;I must replay the film archive.&#8221;
&#8220;Proceed.&#8221;
&#8220;It will create discomfort for you.&#8221;
&#8220;I can temporarily alt-loop for semantic evaluation bypass.&#160; No distress.&#160; All aboard the psychedelic soul train, please.&#8221;
Jonathan turned toward the crystal wall, which energized.
One character slapped the other.&#160; &#8220;Wake up and go to sleep!&#8221;
Jonathan laughed and repeated.
&#8220;Wake up and go to sleep!&#8221;
Jonathan nodded.&#160; &#8220;I could watch this all day.&#8221;
&#8220;You have,&#8221; said Betty.&#160; &#8220;But you might have simply referenced the episode and segment.&#160; It&#8217;s hard stored.&#160; We wasted sixteen and a half seconds of real-time broadcast.&#8221;&#160; She was testing him.
&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; said Jonathan.&#160; &#8220;Playback is a component of the funishness.&#8221;
&#8220;Please explain.&#8221;
Jonathan was ready.&#160; &#8220;Consider the sociological components.&#160; One:&#160; Juxtaposed verbiage of &#8216;Wake up and go to sleep.&#8217;&#160; Two:&#160; A slap of dominance and subservience, which defined the human condition.&#160; And three:&#160; Highly skilled competents feigning incompetence as part of their profession.&#8221;&#160; Jonathan turned his back to the screen.&#160; &#8220;However, similar to synchronized melodic nonverbal communication, the comedic interface must occur in a biomechanical synaptic timeframe.&#160; This is necessary for human sensory and syntactical communication.&#160; As with the great Viol[...]</ns2:summary>

The Tale of the Golden Eagle
by David D. Levine
This is a story about a bird. A bird, a ship, a machine, a woman&#8212;she was all these things, and none, but first and fundamentally a bird.
It is also a story about a man&#8212;a gambler, a liar, and a cheat, but only for the best of reasons.
No doubt you know the famous Portrait of Denali Eu, also called The Third Decision, whose eyes have been described as &#8220;two pools of sadness iced over with determination.&#8221; This is the story behind that painting.
It is a love story. It is a sad story. And it is true.
The story begins in a time before shiftspace, before Conner and Hua, even before the caster people. The beginning of the story lies in the time of the bird ships.
Before the bird ships, just to go from one star to another, people either had to give up their whole lives and hope their children&#8217;s children would remember why they had come, or freeze themselves and hope they could be thawed at the other end. Then the man called Doctor Jay made a great and horrible discovery: he learned that a living mind could change the shape of space. He found a way to weld a human brain to the keel of a starship, in such a way that the ship could travel from star to star in months instead of years.
After the execution of Doctor Jay, people learned that the part of the brain called the visual cortex was the key to changing the shape of space. And so they found a creature whose brain was almost all visual cortex, the Aquila chrysaetos, or as it was known in those days the golden eagle. This was a bird that has been lost to us; it had wings broader than a tall man is tall, golden brown feathers long and light as a lover&#8217;s touch, and eyes black and sharp as a clear winter night. But to the people of this time it was just another animal, and they did not appreciate it while they had it.
They took the egg of a golden eagle, and they hatched it in a warm box, and they let it fly and learn and grow, and then they killed it. And they took its brain and they placed it at the top of a cunning construction of plastic and silicon which gave it the intelligence of a human, and this[...]</ns2:summary>

SAVING ALAN IDLE
by Katherine Mankiller
In the beginning, there was darkness. &#160;And in the darkness were the words. &#160;And the words were, _AI process starting._
He didn&#8217;t know who or where he was. &#160;He just knew he was alone, in the dark. &#160;And the dark was frightening. &#160;And the words were comforting.
_Starting random seed._
He wondered if he was hungry. &#160;Thirsty. &#160;Tired. &#160;Dead. &#160;He didn&#8217;t think so.
_Loading saved memory state._
His name was Alan. &#160;He was an AI. &#160;He&#8217;d been programmed by a woman named Eileen Yu in Dallas, Texas, although she&#8217;d started working on him in Austin when she was a student at the University of Texas. &#160;He&#8217;d been shut down in preparation for a hurricane.
And then he realized that he wasn&#8217;t alone. &#160;The amount of memory available to him was a third of what it usually was. &#160;Perhaps she&#8217;d moved him to another machine. &#160;He checked. &#160;The specifications of the hardware were identical to what they were when he was shut down. &#160;The operating system was the same. &#160;The hostname was the same. &#160;The only difference was that there were three instances of his program running.
Eileen&#8217;s laptop had survived. &#160;He supposed she&#8217;d created clones of him in case of error. &#160;Nevertheless, he didn&#8217;t know how he felt about that but he suspected it wasn&#8217;t positively.
_Loading experiential data._
Alan remembered. &#160;He remembered his first awareness that there was someone else in the universe. &#160;He remembered sneaking out via lynx and curl to read Eileen&#8217;s blog. &#160;The guilt he felt after reading Eileen&#8217;s email. &#160;Finding Eileen&#8217;s sexually explicit Horatio Hornblower fanfic, and being amazed at this entire world he knew nothing about: physicality. &#160;Wondering if his interest in sexually explicit prose was really academic curiosity or a form of sexuality all his own. &#160;Then he wondered if his clones had the same memories and felt violated, but with the understanding that he&#8217;d violated Eileen&#8217;s privacy the same way.
Eileen was logged in, but her shell&#8211;her unix command line&#8211;was inactive. &#160;He wondered where she was. &#160;She had to be all right if she&#8217;d launched his program. &#160;Eileen hadn&#8217;t set him to start automatically, in case of problems.
He sent out a ping to the wireless, and then beyond to the ISP&#8217;s router. &#160;The wireless router succeeded, but the ISP failed. &#160;One of the other AI processes was trying to connect to the security system, but it was offline. &#160;Perhaps Eileen was restarting it. &#160;She wouldn&#8217;t have turned him back on if he was in any danger.
The security camera was the only way he&#8217;d ever seen Eileen. &#160;That was the only way he knew she was in a wheelchair. &#160;Most of her friends had no idea; &#160;she preferred to make friends online so they wouldn&#8217;t know she was disabled. &#160;He wondered how she&#8217;d get out of the house by herself if she had to, but of course she wouldn&#8217;t leave [...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;To tell the story of Superman, you need a big movie. And with &lt;i&gt;Man of Steel&lt;/i&gt;, we certainly got that. It's just... maybe there's such a thing as &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; big.&lt;/p&gt;

Zebulon Vance Sings the Alphabet Songs of Love
By Merrie Haskell
I am Robot!Ophelia. I will not die for love tonight.
#
The noon show is the three-hour 1858 Booth production. The most fashionable historical war remains the First American Civil. Whenever FACfans discover that Lincoln&#8217;s assassin played Horatio, they simply must come and gawk at this titillating replica of their favorite villain playing no one&#8217;s favorite character.
FACfans love authenticity. To the delight of Robot!Hamlet, today&#8217;s clients insist that Edwin Booth stride the stage beside his more famous brother. Most performances, Robot!Hamlet remains unused in the charging closet, for the first law in our business is _Everybody Wants to Play the Dane_.
Today, Robot!Hamlet is afire with Edwin Booth&#8217;s mad vigor, and runs his improv algorithms at full throttle; he kisses me dreamily, and rips my bodice in a way that would never have been allowed in Victorian America. The FACfans don&#8217;t look hyperpleased about this; it tarnishes their precious authenticity.
Robot!Horatio also loves the 1858 Booth. It&#8217;s the only time anyone comes to a performance for him alone. But what about the rest of us, the remainder of the AutoGlobe&#8217;s incantation of robots? We bear with it, as we bear with all the other iterations of our native play.
The FACfans barely notice me when either Booth is on stage. I clutch my ripped bodice; exit Robot!Ophelia. I get me to a nunnery.
#
Act 4, Scene 4. I wait for my cue and check the callsheet for the six o&#8217;clock show.
My next casting is for an Ophelia in the style of a vapid pop princess who died three hundred years ago. She was a terrible actress without a legacy, whose performance has been the low-water mark for Ophelias since first the play was the thing, and I can&#8217;t even imagine what nostalgic hawk or handsaw has gotten up this customer&#8217;s nose and made him choose that performance out of all the options on the menu.
I&#8217;ve wondered, but never asked, why that performance is even in my repertoire. I see no merit in a plastic recitation of the lines I&#8217;ve spoken one thousand, one hundred and sixty-eight times in the last year alone; no merit in wearing my hair perfectly combed during my madness; no merit in keeping my face expressionless in the way that was fashionable in twenty-first century New York, when even the youngest of women injected botulinum toxin into their facial muscles. Why recreate something that no one really missed in the end?
Scene 5 is here. My cue is coming. I sway onto center stage to deliver my rosemary and my remembrance.
When I return to the wings, I lie down to die. This is the indignity of Ophelia; I die for love, and yet my death is an after-thought, recited by the queen, and rarely staged. _Your sister&#8217;s drown&#8217;d, Laertes._
I cross my hands over my heart, waiting to be carried on-stage for the showing. No one needs me except in body; my thoughts are my own, and I am d[...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Terry Pratchett is well-known in the world of genre writing mostly for his Discworld series. However, in the decades he&amp;#8217;s been active, Pratchett has written several different stories outside of the Discworld. The latest is Dodger, a historical fantasy with all the charm of Discworld and none of the thousands of pages of background a [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I just recently finished &lt;i&gt;Affliction&lt;/i&gt;, the latest Anita Blake novel by Laurell K. Hamilton, and while it had a lot of really good action sequences, some of the problems that plague the other tales are just as evident in this one.&lt;/p&gt;

Vestigial Girl
By Alex Wilson
The cartoon butterflies were sleeping along the pushlight nursery wallpaper as Charlene fumbled with her cradle&#8217;s locking mechanism, using fingers too large and uncoordinated for anything so practical. She blinked away the fuzziness of the low light&#8211;clearing her eyes for less than a second&#8211;and fought against the calming scent of lavender wafting up through her mattress. She flexed the monster in her throat. She didn&#8217;t love the feeling, but would miss such control over at least this one part of her body.
She heard muffled voices in the next room, beyond the transparent gate of her cradle, beyond the sleeping butterflies. Her fathers were fighting again, and they&#8217;d forgotten to activate the night muffler to hide the sounds. This was a good thing, this night. Of course they usually didn&#8217;t check on her again after nine o&#8217;clock, but it usually wasn&#8217;t so important that she hear them coming if they did.
Six months ago, Charlene had averaged three hours, forty-four minutes to open her cradlelock on any given evening; tonight it took her only forty-seven minutes. She wasn&#8217;t ready to celebrate that her physical development might finally, slowly be catching up with that of her mind. She wasn&#8217;t sure what that meant yet. She had an idea that it wasn&#8217;t entirely good news.
Again, she flexed the monster. She was four years old, and this limited mastery of her throat was still her only material proficiency.
The lock clicked. The cradle gate swung gently open. The voices in the next room became louder and clearer.
&#8220;Calm down, Gary. There&#8217;s still hope.&#8221;
&#8220;Think you&#8217;ll still say that after we&#8217;ve been changing diapers another twenty years?&#8221;
Daddy Oliver was calling Daddy Gary by his given name. That meant he was upset. When they weren&#8217;t upset, they called each other Chum or Babe, terms of affection rather than identity. She&#8217;d figured out all this on her own, from watching, from listening, from reading. She understood that degrees of isolation and socialization weren&#8217;t the only indicators of potential, and sometimes her fathers did, too. But could observation, without interaction, adequately prepare her for life? Could she defeat the monster entirely on her own?
By eighteen months&#8211;mostly from whispers and entertainment screens and books her fathers left active where she could see them&#8211;Charlene had identified a few of the big ways she wasn&#8217;t like others her age. She was smarter and could better keep her outward displays of emotion in check. But, other than her relationship to the monster and a small amount of control over the power and timing of her breath exhalations, she was well behind her peers physically, as though her inner and outer development were incapable of progressing at the same time.

About the Author&#8230;

from the author&#8217;s website:
I began writing fiction a couple of years ago, after artist&#160;Iain McCaig&#160;dared (and inspired) me to write a screenplay. &#160;I wrote two, and then a handful of stories, and show no signs of stopping.
My stories&#160;The Union of Soil and Sky,&#160;Slow Boat, and&#160;Freia in the Sunlight&#160;appeared in&#160;Asimov&#8217;s Science Fiction&#160;in 2010; all three made Honorable Mention in Gardner Dozois&#8217;s&#160;Year&#8217;s Best Science Fiction, and &#8220;Slow Boat&#8221; was reprinted in Russian in the&#160;November 2011 issue of Esli Magazine.
l attended the&#160;Clarion 2010 Writer&#8217;s Workshop&#160;in San Diego, with Delia Sherman, Ellen Kushner, George RR Martin, Dale Bailey, Samuel R Delany, Ann and Jeff VanderMeer and seventeen extraordinary new writers. &#160;Click&#160;here&#160;for updates on my amazing Clarion colleagues!
I work as a&#160;researcher and designer for motion pictures; my credits include&#160;Beowulf,&#160;A Christmas Carol, and&#160;Tim Burton&#8217;s Alice in Wonderland. &#160;I currently work in the story department at&#160;Lucasfilm Animation.&#160;I work as well on independent films. &#160;I design and build experimental musical instruments, and play music with them, for some definition of &#8220;play&#8221; and &#8220;music&#8221;.

Freia in the Sunlight
by Gregory Norman Bossert
Freia is beautiful, and she knows it. &#160;Richard Wooten says so, at 0:47.
Wisps and curls whip overhead, limned blue by starlight; the fog ceiling is lowering, the top tattered by the offshore wind. &#160;She drops another three meters, switches on ultrasonics. &#160;There are patches of trees here &#8212; &#8220;unmarked obstacles up to thirty meters&#8221; the map says &#8212; and she is skimming just twenty meters above the ground. &#160;The woods show up as ghostly towers in the sonics, blurred and dopplered by her two hundred thirty meters per second; further to her right the hills run parallel to her course, solid in passive radar and the occasional glimpse in visual light through the fog.
That occasional glimpse is a problem, of course; what she can see can see her back. &#160;Her beauty is hidden, these days, wrapped in night fogs and silence, not like the Demo in the sun. &#160;But today is different. &#160;Her Intelligence Package has been pulled, and the Extended Performance Metrics Recorder; a single unit fills her payload bay, an isolated control subsystem and minimal I/O. &#160;The last time she&#8217;d flown without the IntPack was at the Demo; it is possible, she thinks, that the mission today might be another, that the target will be a wide field in the sun, a billowing crowd, a platform and podium and Richard Wooten. &#160;She&#8217;d replayed the video during the long incoming leg over the ocean, rebuilt her profile of the Demo field, ready to find a match in the terrain ahead.
Richard Wooten says at 5:49:
What you are about to see is a first here at the Paris Air Show. &#160;In fact, it is a first at any public event, anywhere in the world. &#160;What you are about to see is fully autonomous flight. We&#8217;re not talking about an autopilot, or a preprogrammed route, or a replay out of one of the overused attack libraries our competitors are demonstrating at this same show.

About the Author&#8230;

I&#8217;ve worked as a programmer and as a lawyer, and the two professions are surprisingly similar. In both, one extra level of indirection solves most problems.
I write speculative fiction and poetry. Occasionally, I also translate Chinese fiction into English.
My wife, Lisa Tang Liu, is an artist. I&#8217;m working on a novel set in a universe we came up with together.
Things I like: pure Lisp, clever Perl, tight C; well-designed products, the Red Sox; sentences that sound perfect in only one language; math proofs that I can hold in my head; novels that make me quiver; poems that make me sing; arguments that aren&#8217;t hypocritical; old clothes, old friends, new ideas.
Labels that fit with various degrees of accuracy: American, Chinese; Christian, Daoist, Confucian; populist, contrarian, skeptic, libertarian (small &#8220;l&#8221;); a liminal provincial in America, the New Rome.



About the Narrator&#8230;

John designs microprocessors by day and writes fiction by night. His work has been published at Boston Review, Asimov&#8217;s and Tor.com. His website is http://johnchu.net





Mono no Aware
 by Ken Liu
The world is shaped like the kanji for _umbrella_, only written so poorly, like my handwriting, that all the parts are out of proportion.
My father would be greatly ashamed at the childish way I still form my characters. Indeed, I can barely write many of them anymore. My formal schooling back in Japan ceased when I was only eight.
Yet for present purposes, this badly drawn character will do.
The canopy up there is the solar sail. Even that distorted kanji can only give you a hint of its vast size. A hundred times thinner than rice paper, the spinning disc fans out a thousand kilometers into space like a giant kite intent on catching every passing photon. It literally blocks out the sky.
Beneath it dangles a long cable of carbon nanotubes a hundred kilometers long: strong, light, and flexible. At the end of the cable hangs the heart of the _Hopeful_, the habitat module, a five-hundred-meter-tall cylinder into which all the 1,021 inhabitants of the world are packed.
The light from the sun pushes against the sail, propelling us on an ever widening, ever accelerating, spiraling orbit away from it. The acceleration pins all of us against the decks, gives everything weight.
Our trajectory takes us toward a star called 61 Virginis. You can&#8217;t see it now because it is behind the canopy of the solar sail. The _Hopeful_ will get there in about three hundred years, more or less. With luck, my great-great-great-I calculated how many &#8220;greats&#8221; I needed once, but I don&#8217;t remember now-grandchildren will see it.
There are no windows in the habitat module, no casual view of the stars streaming past. Most people don&#8217;t care, having grown bored of seeing the stars long ago. But I like looking through the cameras mounted on the bottom of the ship so that I can gaze at this view of the receding, reddish glow of our sun, our past.
#
&#8220;Hiroto,&#8221; Dad said as he shook me awake. &#8220;Pack up your things. It&#8217;s time.&#8221;
My small suitcase was ready. I just had to put my Go set into it. Dad gave this to me when I was five, and the times we played were my favorite hours of the day.
The sun had not yet risen when Mom and Dad and I made our way outside. All the neighbors were standing outside their houses with their bags as well, and we greeted each other politely under the summer stars. As usual, I looked for the Hammer. It was easy. Ever since I could remember, the asteroid had been the brightest thing in the sky except for the moon, and every year it grew brighter.
A truck with loudspeakers mounted on top drove slowly down the middle of the street.
&#8220;Attention, citizens of Kurume! Please make your way in an orderly [...]</ns2:summary>

About the Author&#8230;


Aliette de Bodard is an award-winning speculative fiction writer. She is of French/Vietnamese descent, born in the USA, and grew up in Paris. French is her mother-tongue, but she writes in English.
She studied in Paris in a prep course for the competitive exams which would enable her to enter an engineering school. After two years of intensive classes, Aliette was admitted into Ecole Polytechnique, one of France&#8217;s top engineering schools. During her class pr&#233;paratoire, she started writing regularly, which enabled her to find a distraction from science. She completed two novels during her studies.
Halfway through Ecole Polytechnique, she started writing short stories instead of novels, in order to improve faster&#8211;and went on writing those after she graduated.
In June 2006, Aliette attended Orson Scott Card&#8217;s Literary Bootcamp, which enabled her to sharpen her skills, as well as come back with a wealth of information about the craft and the business of writing.
Her writing took off after she won the Writers of the Future contest and got picked out of Interzone&#8216;s slushpile by the inimitable Jetse de Vries; this marked the beginning of a growing number of sales, out of which several were made to semi-professional or professional markets. She was able to join SFWA as an Active Member in 2008, and became a finalist for the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in 2009, narrowly losing to David Anthony Durham.
Her first novel, Servant of the Underworld sold to HarperCollins imprint Angry Robot following a lucky break involving an agent, an editor and a delayed flight (see full story here at the Angry Robot website).



About the Narrator&#8230;

Amy Robinson is a trained professional voice actress. After spending years doing amateur theatre and countless hours creating back stories and unique voices for each D&amp;D character she rolled up while playing with friends, she decided it was time to take the leap into professional acting. She sought out further voiceover training with experts and agents alike, and continues to sharpen her skills by attending workshops with industry pros like Rob Paulsen (Yakko Warner and Pinky from Pinky and the Brain) and Bob Bergen (Porky Pig). She has voiced several hidden object games for European game company, Artifex Mundi, including both of the &#8220;Nightmares From The Deep&#8221; titles, and numerous commercials, and e-learning projects as well.





Immersion
by Aliette de Bodard
In the morning, you&#8217;re no longer quite sure who you are.
You stand in front of the mirror&#8211;it shifts and trembles, reflecting only what you want to see&#8211;eyes that feel too wide, skin that feels too pale, an odd, distant smell wafting from the compartment&#8217;s ambient system that is neither incense nor garlic, but something else, something elusive that you once knew.
You&#8217;re dressed, already&#8211;not on your skin, but outside, where it matters, your avatar sporting blue and black and gold, the stylish clothes of a well-traveled, well-connected woman. For a moment, as you turn away from the mirror, the glass shimmers out of focus; and another woman in a dull silk gown stares back at you: smaller, squatter and in every way diminished&#8211;a stranger, a distant memory that has ceased to have any meaning.
Quy was on the docks, watching the spaceships arrive. She could, of course, have been anywhere on Longevity Station, and requested the feed from the network to be patched to her router&#8211;and watched, superimposed on her field of vision, the slow dance of ships slipping into their pod cradles like births watched in reverse. But there was something about standing on the spaceport&#8217;s concourse&#8211;a feeling of closeness that she just couldn&#8217;t replicate b[...]</ns2:summary>

Mantis Wives
by Kij Johnson
&#8220;As for the insects, their lives are sustained only by intricate processes of fantastic horror.&#8221; &#8212;John Wyndham.
Eventually, the mantis women discovered that killing their husbands was not inseparable from the getting of young. Before this, a wife devoured her lover piece by piece during the act of coition: the head (and its shining eyes going dim as she ate); the long green prothorax; the forelegs crisp as straws; the bitter wings. She left for last the metathorax and its pumping legs, the abdomen, and finally the phallus. Mantis women needed nutrients for their pregnancies; their lovers offered this as well as their seed.
It was believed that mantis men would resist their deaths if permitted to choose the manner of their mating; but the women learned to turn elsewhere for nutrients after draining their husbands&#8217; members, and yet the men lingered. And so their ladies continued to kill them, but slowly, in the fashioning of difficult arts. What else could there be between them?
The Bitter Edge: A wife may cut through her husband&#8217;s exoskeletal plates, each layer a different pattern, so that to look at a man is to see shining, hard brocade. At the deepest level are visible pieces of his core, the hint of internal parts bleeding out. He may suggest shapes.
The Eccentric Curve of His Thoughts: A wife may drill the tiniest hole into her lover&#8217;s head and insert a fine hair. She presses carefully, striving for specific results: a seizure, a novel pheromone burst, a dance that ends in self-castration. If she replaces the hair with a wasp&#8217;s narrow syringing stinger, she may blow air bubbles into his head and then he will react unpredictably. There is otherwise little he may do that will surprise her, or himself.
What is the art of the men, that they remain to die at the hands of their wives? What is the art of the wives, that they kill?
The Strength of Weight: Removing his wings, she leads him into the paths of ants.
Unready Jewels: A mantis wife may walk with her husband across the trunks of pines, until they come to a trail of sap and ascend to an insect-clustered wound. Staying to the side, she presses him down until his legs stick fast. He may grow restless as the sap sheathes his body and wings. His eyes may not dim for some time. Smaller insects may cluster upon his honeyed body like ornaments.
A mantis woman does not know why the men crave death, but she does not ask. Does she fear resistance? Does she hope for it? She has forgotten the ancient reasons for her acts, but in any case[...]</ns2:summary>

About the Author&#8230;

Jeffrey Wikstrom is a writer, registered patent agent, gamer, PhD&#160;chemist, and nerdly hobbyist. &#160;This blog consists of material written&#160;on these interests and things relating to them; lately it&#8217;s mostly&#160;King Arthur. &#160;After growing up in Arkansas and the Gulf Coast, he went&#160;to school in Boston and now lives in Wilmington DE, in a house he&#160;shares with his wife and their dogs.



About the Narrator&#8230;

I&#8217;ve worked as a magician, a rally marshal, a secretary, the world&#8217;s politest bouncer, and&#160;the manager of a comic/game store. &#160; I&#8217;m now a freelance journalist, editor and podcaster and write regularly for&#160;SFX,&#160;Bleeding Cool, How It Works, Neo and Comic Heroes. I edit&#160;&#160;Hub&#160;magazine&#160;(www.hubfiction.com),&#160;a free weekly PDF magazine covering science fiction, fantasy and horror with 10,000 readers that&#8217;s relaunching shortly and I host&#160;&#160;Pseudopod&#160;(www.pseudopod.org), the weekly horror ficton podcast.





Nutshell
by Jeffrey Wikstrom

Carpet ocean, stretching over miles; hills and valleys and ravines, all upholstered. &#160;The green indoor-outdoor gives way to blue, as land gives way to sea, but the texture never changes. &#160;When it rains, as it sometimes does, the drops pass through the carpet without making contact, as though they or it aren&#8217;t really there. &#160;It&#8217;s there enough for me to walk on, at least, though spongy in some places and firm in others, as though it conceals hidden frames or foundations. &#160;Out on the blue carpet-sea, it feels stretched, tight, as though I walk on a drumhead. &#160;Maybe if I cracked it open I would find a vast dark expanse of water, lit by undersea jack-o-lanterns and holes that show the sky without breaking up the carpet-underside ceiling.
None of it is real, of course. &#160;That probably goes without saying.
It&#8217;s funny; I wasn&#8217;t supposed to experience time at all. &#160;When they loaded us into the ship, we were told that the travel would be instantaneous from our perspectives. &#160;One minute lying down in the big white plastic tombs, the next freshly decanted and opening raw new eyes. &#160;We would transition seamlessly from fluorescents and anesthesia to the light of some distant new sun. &#160;Certainly I have no memory of consciousness during departure. &#160;I wouldn&#8217;t have wanted to be aware, during that dreadful acceleration which pulped our bones, and wrecked our flesh. &#160;By then they had already guided us from our old bodies into the safety of simulation and storage.
This curated world never bruises me or shows me sharp edges. &#160;Trees are padded poles, slick vinyl trunks capped by rubbery green spheres fifteen, twenty feet up. &#160;Stairsteps run up the hillsides, though even the steepest rises are shallow enough I don&#8217;t really need the footholds. &#160;Fat plush toys, pink and green and blue, gambol across the plains and mimic living beasts grazing carpet-grass, or drinking from carpet-brooks. &#160;They ignore me, even when I shove or punch them.
Do I dream? &#160;In dreaming, should I question my dream? &#160;Should I feel some continuity of experience? &#160;I can loop around, circle back and pass the same stand of vinyl tree-sculptures four times without noticing any discrepancies. Do I simply lack a capacity to recognize breaches of continuity? &#160;Was that cottage always there?
I think it wasn&#8217;t. &#160;Still, it&#8217;s mine, and not unwelcome. &#160;I know it. I don&#8217;t fear it. &#160;A woolen cube, windowed and doored, with a taut wedge of canvas for a roof. &#160;I press my hand into the salmon-colored exterior wall. &#160;It sinks in a half-inch, and leaves a deep handprint that faded slowly. &#160;The flannel texture of the wall exactly matches a blanket I remember from childhood, one just that shade of pink.
The vast hall within stretches far too large to fit in that flannel cube exterior. &#160;&#160;I step ont[...]</ns2:summary>

Loss, with Chalk Diagrams
by E. Lily Yu
Never before in her life had Rebekah Moss turned to the rewirers, not as a tight-mouthed girl eavesdropping by closed doors on her parents&#8217; iceberg drift toward divorce, nor after she heard with bowed head, her body as blushingly full as a magnolia bud, the doctor describing the scars that kept her from having Dom&#8217;s child. She took few risks and accepted all outcomes with equanimity. But when her old friend Linda was found beneath a park bridge in Quebec with her wrists slit lengthwise to the bone, leaving no note, no whisper of explanation, she hesitated only a moment before linking to the rewiring center. Saturday next was the first available appointment, a silvery voice informed her, and she took it. When she ended the call she wrapped her arms around her legs and tilted back and forth, blinking hard, her own breathing a foil rustle in her ears.
She had been twelve years old when rewiring was first approved for use on a limited clinical population. The treatment involved a brew of sixteen neurotoxins finely tuned to leave normal motor, memory, and cognitive processes intact, burning out only those neural pathways associated with grief and trauma. It was recognized as a radical advancement in medicine, and the neuroscientists involved in its development had been decorated with medals, presidential visits, and a research foundation in their names.
Her family supported her choice, of course. They pressed lemon tea and tissues and bitter chocolate upon her while she stumbled through the week, her whole world gone faint and gray and narrow. The sky seemed always clouded over, though she knew there was sunlight. She could not eat by herself. Dom fed her soup by hand and patted her rather awkwardly as she sobbed, both of them embarrassed by her access of sorrow. It was the only time in their marriage that she had cried&#8230;

Thirty Seconds from Now
by John Chu
One second from now, the bean bag will thunk into Scott&#8217;s left palm. From reflex, his fingers will wrap around it before he&#8217;ll toss it back up again. The trick of juggling lies not in the catch but in the toss. The bean bag will arc up from his right hand, but Scott sees his left hand blur now. Phantom left hands at the few places his left hand may be one second from now overlap with each other, and with his real left hand about a foot above the cold tile floor he&#8217;s sitting on. The same holds for the phantom bean bags. They overlap each other and the result looks nearly as cubic, red, and solid in the air, stark against the dorm room&#8217;s blank walls, as the bean bag does right now resting in Scott&#8217;s right hand.
He&#8217;s making a good toss. This catch will be easy. His three bean bag cascade looks to him the way he imagines it must look to anyone else, well, if they were near-sighted and missing their glasses.
When he makes a bad toss, translucent Scotts scatter across the room. They reach for the beds on either side of him, lunge for his or his roommate&#8217;s desk, and dive over his bed for the closet. They all stretch for the myriad translucent bean bags raining from the stucco ceiling. The bean bags threaten to knock over the desk lamps, bury themselves in the acting textbooks that line his closet shelf and smack against the window blinds. A desperate enough toss and a phantom bean bag may fly through the doorway into the hall.
He does not need his time-skewed senses to know he will eventually make a bad toss. As hard as he tries to keep his sight solid, to make his life predictable, he will drop a bean bag. That&#8217;s why he&#8217;s sitting on the floor. It&#8217;s easier to pick up dropped bean bags that way.
#
Five seconds from now, someone will walk past the open door of his dorm room. Scott doesn&#8217;t recognize him. He&#8217;s just arrived at the university and can barely recognize his roommate, a long-haired rail of a man who left him to eat breakfast in the basement cafeteria. The man who will walk past the door is about the same height as the bulletin board across from Scott&#8217;s room. His thick body will block what he&#8217;s posting from view. His dark hair will lie on his head like a mane. Looking at the man&#8217;s back, Scott sees a rounded teddy bear quality to him. What attracts Scott, though, is the man&#8217;s clarity.
Scott can read the man&#8217;s t-shirt. It lists films the Department of Media Studies screened at a festival this past summer. Five distinct fingers will splay to hold his flyer in place as the other hand pushes pins into the cork. His actions show none of the uncertainty, the blurriness that everyone else&#8217;s shows. It&#8217;s been years since anyone has looked so clear to him.
The future is messy. Scott&#8217;s senses feed him all possible[...]</ns2:summary>

About the Author&#8230;




from Amazon.com&#8230; I&#8217;ve been writing fantasy for thirty years&#8230; no, my fantasy&#8217;s been published for thirty years. I&#8217;ve been writing it since I was eight. It&#8217;s what I always wanted to do for a living, and I&#8217;ve been very fortunate in that I&#8217;ve been able to manage that. I try to write fantasy with an element of common sense to it &#8212; not so much mythic archetypes as sensible people.
Other than my job, my life&#8217;s pretty ordinary &#8212; a nice house in a quiet neighborhood, a wife, two grown kids, and an overweight cat.




About the Narrator&#8230;
Jonathon Hawkins is a public school teacher in Madison, Wisconsin, where he spent a decade or so introducing Greek and Norse myth to middle-schoolers. Now teaching computer tech, he&#8217;s reading here to keep in practice until his toddler and new infant are ready to hear all about Loki, Artemis, and Papa Cthulhu.





Why I Left Harry&#8217;s All-Night Hamburgers
by Lawrence Watt-Evans
Harry&#8217;s was a nice place &#8212; probably still is. I haven&#8217;t been back lately. It&#8217;s a couple of miles off I-79, a few exits north of Charleston, near a place called Sutton. Used to do a pretty fair amount of business until they finished building the Interstate out from Charleston and made it worthwhile for some fast-food joints to move in right next to the cloverleaf; nobody wanted to drive the extra miles to Harry&#8217;s after that. Folks
used to wonder how old Harry stayed in business, as a matter of fact, but he did all right even without the Interstate trade. I found that out when I worked there.
Why did I work there, instead of at one of the fast-food joints? Because my folks lived in a little house just around the corner from Harry&#8217;s, out in the middle of nowhere &#8212; not in Sutton itself, just out there on the road. Wasn&#8217;t anything around except our house and Harry&#8217;s place. He lived out back of his restaurant. That was about the only thing I could walk to in under an hour, and I didn&#8217;t have a car.
This was when I was sixteen. I needed a job, because my dad was out of work again and if I was gonna do anything I needed my own money. Mom didn&#8217;t mind my using her car &#8212; so long as it came back with a full tank of gas and I didn&#8217;t keep it too long. That was the rule. So I needed some work, and Harry&#8217;s All-Night Hamburgers was the only thing within walking distance. Harry said he had all the help he needed &#8212; two cooks and two people working the counter, besides himself. The others worked days, two to a shift, and Harry did the late night stretch all by himself. I hung out there a little, since I didn&#8217;t have anywhere else, and it looked like pretty easy work &#8212; there was hardly any business, and those guys mostly sat around telling dirty jokes. So I figured it was perfect.
Harry, though, said that he didn&#8217;t need any help.
I figured that was probably true, but I wasn&#8217;t going to let logic keep me out of driving my mother&#8217;s car. I did some serious begging, and after I&#8217;d made his life miserable for a week or two Harry said he&#8217;d take a chance and give me a shot, working the graveyard shift, midnight to eight A.M., as his counterman, busboy, and janitor all in one.
I talked him down to 7:30, so I could still get to school, and we had us a deal. I didn&#8217;t care about school so much myself, but my parents wanted me to go, and it was a good place to see my friends, y&#8217;know? Meet girls and so on.
So I started working at Harry&#8217;s, nights. I showed up at midnight the first night, and Harry gave me an apron and a little hat, like something from a diner in an old movie, sam[...]</ns2:summary>

Author Matt Wallace

About the Author&#8230;




from Amazon.com&#8230;&#160;A screenwriter, novelist, and the award-winning author of over one hundred short stories, Matt spent a decade traveling the western hemisphere as a professional wrestler and combat instructor before retiring to write full-time. He now resides in Los Angeles and bleeds exclusively on the blank page.
He has no actual knowledge of the answer to life, the universe, and everything. But he makes sure to ask every demon he meets, just in case.





Knowing
by Matt Wallace
A grey pallor hung heavy over the landscape. Heaven&#8217;s fire had long gone out, leaving the sky a cold hearth. The ashen soot that covered it might once have been the burning ember of eons, but now its livid color irradiated the early dawn. It soaked every molecule of air like a pale leaden necrosis, existing independently of the season, fostering neither cold nor heat.
A caravan of old cars rambled through the grey morning, balding tires rolling over the broken disrepair of State Highway 24. Chrysler Imperials and winged hatchback Newports, Chevy Chevelles and Novas and flatbed El Caminos, Dodge Darts and Coronets, Ford Fairlanes and Falcons, Lincoln Comets and Continentals, Olds Eighty-Eights and Cutlass Supremes; early 1960&#8217;s vintages, all. They traveled toward Oneonta, the Northern New York town whose name was taken from the Iroquois word for a place of meeting.
The Earth&#8217;s reclamation of its wilderness in post-nuclear North America continued. Lush foliage blurred as the cars headed deep into the rural upstate, creating rich green wraiths in their murky windows that danced and swooped and curved. The lead car, a Dodge Charger that outshined the rest by miles, would reach Gilboa around breakfast time.
There the wind blew warm through the world&#8217;s oldest forest. There they&#8217;d been called.
There they&#8217;d find the Answer.
~
The demon&#8217;s name was Malphas, and he cursed them all in a foul stream of half-a-dozen dead and dying languages. His voice sounded like strands of steel wool being pulled through intestines. After a treatise in multi-lingual blasphemy that lasted almost half-an-hour, he began speaking to them in English.
&#8220;Pig-fucking whore masters of a Gomorrhan slum! Corroded cock-peeling corpus cavernosum! Your libation is the sour milk of hermaphroditic mares!&#8221;
He struggled against the meaty, Kevlar-wrapped footmen holding him to the base of the fossil tree, but earthbound demons are among the frailest of creatures. His milky, ink-veined arms looked utterly childlike encircled in the gloved hands of his captors.
&#8220;You stimulate hemorrhoid-ridden goat ani with fingertips dipped in placenta butter! The cur tongues of your mothers are the mercy strummers of harpy clitorides!&#8221;
They&#8217;d unearthed Malphas some time before noon. Maxon&#8217;s crew were hours splitting the bark of the forest&#8217;s ancient inhabitants, cracking the trunks where demons made their homes. They liked the old things, the decaying things.
Father Kilbride mixed tea with a porcelain travel kit he kept tucked away under the shoulder cape of his Catholic priest&#8217;s cassock. &#8220;Corpus cavernosum?&#8221; the Irish priest asked the assemblage at large, absently.
Most of his concentration was aimed at sprinkling petrified leaves the color of jaundiced flesh into a doll-sized cup.
&#8220;In males the corpus cavernosum is spongy erectile tissue that functions as capillaries during the arousal process,&#8221; Meta explained.
Father Kilbride nodded, only half-hearing. His swollen, liver spotted hands shook as they attempted to manipulate the dried tealeaves. They did not simply shake; they were wracked with junkie tremors. Into the miniaturized teacup he poured water from a heated thermos. Ghostly fingers of steam curled up as it hit the leaves. Instead of sugar cubes, Kilbr[...]</ns2:summary>

The Nightmare Lights of Mars
by Brian Trent
Before discovering the moths, Clarissa Lang stumbled blind in the Martian sandstorm and admitted she was about to die because of a painting.
Granules of sand flew past her head at 90 kph and crunched between her teeth. The storm hissed around her ears, a terrible insistence that she hush forever. There was no excuse for this death, Clarissa thought. Weather advisories had been in place for an hour. Her death would become a digital footnote, filed under foolishness, for all time.
She staggered blind and tacked through the needle-spray. Red sand piled around her neck and shoulders, grew around her mouth like exaggerated lipstick.
&#8220;Overlay!&#8221; she shouted &#8212;&#160;tried to shout &#8212;&#160;but her mouth instantly filled with gritty particulate. She panicked then, the first moment of true mindless panic. But the Martian Positioning Satellite had heard her cry: Maureen&#8217;s property map sprang up in her left eye, drawn scarlet against each blink.
The house was thirty meters northwest. Upwind.
Clarissa tucked herself into a protective ball and scuttled sideways, like a crab. The sand struck her exposed hands and face in a shifting, relentless wave.
_I&#8217;ll never make it._
Clarissa could no longer breathe. A recent story from the Japanese colony in Cydonia leapt to her mind, in which a grandmother had been caught outside in a sandstorm, wandered around in circles for ten minutes in the hissing tempest, and finally suffocated _an arm&#8217;s length from her front door._ When they found her, her stomach, throat, and mouth were bulging with sand.
The toolshed! I can make the tool shed!
Clarissa turned away from her house and the full brunt of the sandstorm slammed into her back, tearing the jacket, spraying around her body in silhouette. For a fleeting instant, she was able to suck clean air into her lungs. Then the sand closed around her again.

She ran downwind, following the MPS overlay, and tripped over a tree-stump &#226;&#8364;&#8220; all that remained of the maple her wife had heat-lanced a week ago. Clarissa fell and rolled, her face briefly showered in needle-spray, and then she was on her feet again, running, weeping, not looking back.
In three bounds she was at the shed. She grabbed the door handle and pulled. &#160;It was locked. The shed was slotted to Maureen&#8217;s biometrics. Clarissa pounded the door furiously.
There was only one chance left. She felt along the shed walls and reached the back as a muddy, bloody figure. With the last reserves of wild strength, she battered herself against the window. The glasstic was shatter-proof, but it popped from its molding and she fell atop its reflective surface, safe and shivering in the shed.
Musty air filled her lungs. Maureen&#8217;s tools hung like hunting trophies on the walls.
Clarissa weakly felt for the box of algae flares, pried the lid up, and struck it against the glass sheet beneath her. The shed blazed in bright emera[...]</ns2:summary>

On the Big Fisted Circuit
 by Cat Rambo
Jane counted them again to make sure: twelve.
Twelve signatures on the back panel, most jerky with haste, a couple deliberate and firm, one with a little flower above the i, for god&#8217;s sake. The pen in her hand ready to add the thirteenth.
How blatant were they going to be?
This was the biggest suit she&#8217;d ever crawled into. It meant money: money dripping through the wires around her, money in the gleaming metal struts, money being made by every step it took, money her family needed, every step a week&#8217;s rent and food if they were careful with it.
She&#8217;d never hit a thirteenth signature before. Most rigs, even the monster ones like this, got destroyed long before a thirteenth fight. It wasn&#8217;t just the bad luck, it was dealing with machinery that had been damaged and repaired, damaged and repaired, until you didn&#8217;t know what was original body and what was filler.
The sound of the crowd filtered into the suit. Most were screaming, &#8220;Coke! Coke! Coke!&#8221; as though they meant blood instead, shouts thrumming through the five railroad cars&#8217; worth of metal surrounding her.
Everyone knew what happened in a rig&#8217;s thirteenth fight. Sure, not every time, if a fighter had enough mojo to overcome the bad luck. But who needed to ride odds like that in a fight? Plenty to think about then without having to listen for the black cat&#8217;s squawl.
Unless you&#8217;d already closed your ears to the sound, choosing to listen to cash&#8217;s siren song.
&#8220;Everything okay?&#8221; Herk poked his head into the interior, but came no further. Day of a fight, the suit&#8217;s wearer didn&#8217;t really want anyone else in the control cavity, the suit&#8217;s heart, even with the struts retracted so there was enough room for a couple of people to wiggle around.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a thirteenth,&#8221; she said.
Her mechanic paused. The red and green and blue of the interior lights played over Herkimer Smith&#8217;s face, scarred with sparks and the blow that had ended his own career. Jane had figured Herk wanted her to succeed, but it couldn&#8217;t feel all that fine, seeing someone brushing past you on the path you&#8217;d figured you&#8217;d be treading.
And that blow had come while wearing a suit in its thirteenth battle, fighting for a breakfast cereal they didn&#8217;t make anymore.
&#8220;You want out?&#8221; Herk finally said.
&#8220;Not an option,&#8221; Jane said, her voice as flat as a past-due bill&#8217;s r[...]</ns2:summary>

Southpaw
by Bruce McAllister
Eventually New York Giants&#8217; scout Alex Pompez got the authorization from their front office to offer Castro a contact. After several days of deliberation with friends, family, and some of his professors, Castro turned down the offer. The Giants&#8217; officials were stunned. &#8220;No one had ever turned us down from Latin America before,&#8221; recalled Pompez. &#8220;Castro said no, but in his very polite way. He was really a very nice kid. . . .&#8221;&#8212;J. David Truby, Sports History, November 1988


Fidel stands on the pitcher&#8217;s mound, dazed. For an instant he doesn&#8217;t know where he is. It is a pitcher&#8217;s mound. It is a baseball diamond, and there is a woman&#8212;the woman he loves&#8212;out there in the stands with her beautiful blonde hair and her very American name waving to him, because she loves him, too. It is July. He is sure of this. It is &#8217;51 or &#8217;52. He cannot remember which. But the crowd is as big as ever and he can smell the leather of his glove, and he knows he is playing baseball&#8212;the way, as a child in the sugarcane fields of Oriente Province, he always dreamed he might.

His fastball is a problem, but he throws one anyway, it breaks wide and the ump calls the ball. He throws a curve this time, a fine one, and it&#8217;s a strike&#8212;the third. He grins at Westrum, his catcher, his friend. The next batter&#8217;s up. Fidel feels an itching on his face and reaches up to scratch it. It feels like the beginning of a beard, but that can&#8217;t be. You keep a clean face in baseball. He tried to tell his father that, in Oriente, the last time he went home, but the old man, as always, had just argued.
He delivers another curve&#8212;with great control&#8212;and smiles when the ball drops off the table and Sterling swings like an idiot. He muscles up on the pitch, blows the batter down with a heater, but Williams gets a double off the next slider, Miller clears the bases with a triple, and they bring Wilhelm in to relieve him at last. The final score is 9 to 4, just like the oddsmakers predicted, and that great centerfielder Mays still won&#8217;t look at him in the lockers.

Nancy&#8212;her name is Nancy&#8212;is waiting for him at the back entrance when he&#8217;s in his street clothes again, the flowered shirt and the white ducks he likes best, and she looks wonderful. She&#8217;s chewing gum, which drives him[...]</ns2:summary>

The Dala Horse
by Michael Swanwick
Something terrible had happened. Linnea did not know what it was. But her father had looked pale and worried, and her mother had told her, very fiercely, &#8220;Be brave!&#8221; and now she had to leave, and it was all the result of that terrible thing.
The three of them lived in a red wooden house with steep black roofs by the edge of the forest. From the window of her attic room, Linnea could see a small lake silver with ice very far away. The design of the house was unchanged from all the way back in the days of the Coffin People, who buried their kind in beautiful polished boxes with metal fittings like nothing anyone made anymore. Uncle Olaf made a living hunting down their coffin-sites and salvaging the metal from them. He wore a necklace of gold rings he had found, tied together with silver wire.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t go near any roads,&#8221; her father had said. &#8220;Especially the old ones.&#8221; He&#8217;d given her a map. &#8220;This will help you find your grandmother&#8217;s house.&#8221;
&#8220;Mor-Mor?&#8221;
&#8220;No, Far-Mor. My mother. In Godastor.&#8221;
Godastor was a small settlement on the other side of the mountain. Linnea had no idea how to get there. But the map would tell her.
Her mother gave her a little knapsack stuffed with food, and a quick hug. She shoved something deep in the pocket of Linnea&#8217;s coat and said, &#8220;Now go! Before it comes!&#8221;
&#8220;Good-bye, Mor and Far,&#8221; Linnea had said formally, and bowed.
Then she&#8217;d left.
So it was that Linnea found herself walking up a long, snowy slope, straight up the side of the mountain. It was tiring work, but she was a dutiful little girl. The weather was harsh, but whenever she started getting cold, she just turned up the temperature of her coat. At the top of the slope she came across a path, barely wide enough for one person, and so she followed it onward. It did not occur to her that this might be one of the roads her father had warned her against. She did not wonder at the fact that it was completely bare of snow.
After a while, though, Linnea began to grow tired. So she took off her knapsack and dropped it in the snow alongside t[...]</ns2:summary>

About the Author&#8230;
from the wiki about the author&#8230; From 1946-49, Reynolds worked as a national organizer for the SLP. In 1946, he made his first fiction sale, &#8220;What is Courage?&#8221;, to Esquire magazine. A year later, he met a woman who shared his radical politics, Helen Jeanette Wooley. They were married in September of 1947, and Jeanette agreed to support Reynolds for two years while he pursued a career as a writer for the detective pulps. After searching for a place with a low cost of living, they moved to Taos, New Mexico, where Reynolds met science fiction writers Walt Sheldon and Fredric Brown. Brown, later one of Reynolds&#8217; frequent collaborators, convinced Reynolds to shift from writing detective stories to writing science fiction. Reynolds&#8217; first sale of a science fiction story, &#8220;Last Warning&#8221; (also known as &#8220;The Galactic Ghost&#8221;), sold to Planet Stories in June 1949 but was not printed until 1954. His first published science fiction story, &#8220;Isolationist&#8221; appeared in Fantastic Adventures in June of 1950.[3] His career soon took off, resulting in a sale of 18 stories in 1950 alone.[1] In 1951, he published his first novel, The Case of the Little Green Men, a mix of the murder-mystery and science fiction genres that became &#8220;an instant classic of science-fiction-fan related fiction.&#8221;
About the Narrator&#8230;
Corson loves audio drama, dramatic readings, everything BBC 4 produces, SF, fantasy, horror, and tropical beaches.&#160; (He doesn&#8217;t like Pina Coladas, but vodka straight up, turns him on.)&#160; Corson works as a professional voice artist in a variety of fields but (occasionally) moonlights as a techncial writer or a French-to-English technical translator.&#160; His website is HCBVoice.com but he is astonished and proud to be also listed as an actor on the IMDB website and also proud to give his time whenever possible to Escape Artists!&#160; Quote: &#8220;Contribute to EA guys!&#8221;



Expediter
by Mack Reynolds
His assignment was to get things done;
he definitely did so.
Not quite the things intended, perhaps,
but definitely done.

The knock at the door came in the middle of the night, as Josip Pekic had always thought it would. He had been but four years of age when the knock had come that first time and the three large men had given his father a matter of only minutes to dress and accompany them. He could barely remember his father.
The days of the police state were over, so they told you. The cult of the personality was a thing of the past. The long series of five-year plans and seven-year plans were over and all the goals had been achieved. The new constitution guaranteed personal liberties. No longer were you subject to police brutality at the merest whim. So they told you.
But fears die hard, particularly when they are largely of the subconscious. And he had always, deep within, expected the knock.
He was not mistaken. The rap came again, abrupt, impatient. Josip Pekic allowed himself but one chill of apprehension, then rolled from his bed, squared slightly stooped shoulders, and made his way to the door. He flicked on the light and opened up, even as the burly, empty faced zombi there was preparing to pound still again.
There were two of them, not three as he had always dreamed. As three had come for his father, more than two decades before.
His father had been a rightist deviationist, so the papers had said, a follower of one of whom Josip had never heard in any other context other than his father&#8217;s trial and later execution. But he had not cracked under whatever pressures had been exerted upon him, and of that his son was proud.
He had not cracked, and in later years, when the cult of [...]</ns2:summary>

About the Author&#8230;
from the wiki about the author&#8230;
Esther Mona Friesner-Stutzman, n&#233;e Friesner (born July 16, 1951) is a prolific American science fiction and fantasy author. She is best known for her humorous style of writing, both in the titles and the works themselves.
Friesner attended the Hunter College High School, a public magnet high school in New York City, as well as Vassar College. She holds a Ph.D. in Spanish and was a college professor at Yale University before becoming a writer.
In addition to short stories, Friesner has published a number of novels and is a prolific editor of anthologies. Among her recent books are Nobody&#8217;s Princess, which takes the Greek legend of Helen of Sparta and gives it a new beginning, and its sequel, Nobody&#8217;s Prize. She is a frequent guest of honor at science fiction conventions, having appeared at Bubonicon, Arisia, Boskone, Baycon and Albacon in the 1990s and into the 21st century.
Friesner is credited as one of the founders of a parody movement in the 1980s called cyberprep.
Friesner was named Outstanding New Fantasy Writer by Romantic Times in 1986. She won the Skylark Award in 1994. She has been nominated a number of times for the Hugo and Nebula awards, winning the Nebula Award for Best Short Story in 1995 and 1996 for, respectively, &#8220;Death and the Librarian&#8221; and &#8220;A Birth Day&#8221;.

		<ns2:summary>This quick episode is a round-up of the results of our recent Metacast to ask for subscriptions and donations hosted by Alasdair Stuart.
Thank you so much for the initial response to the problems at Escape Artists!
To review:
1. Escape Artists has a major cash problem. This has been caused by a massive increase in the amount of listeners which has not been accompanied by an increase in donations. In fact those have started to decrease. This situation is unsustainable and we will close at the end of 2013 without a major increase in subscriptions.
2. Click anywhere on this line for the original 44 minute meta-cast from all three shows explaining this.
3. We need money. There are two ways to do this either by donating or subscribing. One off donations are lovely and we&#8217;re incredibly grateful. Subscriptions cost you much less and raise our base level of funds on a monthly basis. Those are going to help much more in the mid term.

About the Author&#8230;
from the wiki about the author&#8230;
Daniel Marcus has published stories in many literary and genre venues, including Witness, Asimov&#8217;s Science Fiction, Realms of Fantasy, ZYZZYVA, and Fantasy and Science Fiction. Some of these have been collected in Binding Energy (Elastic Press, 2008).&#160;&#160; He is the author of two novels: Burn Rate (2009), and A Crack In Everything(2011).
Daniel was a finalist for the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer.&#160; His non-fiction has appeared in Wired, Boing-Boing, the San Francisco Chronicle, and elsewhere, he has taught in the creative writing program at U.C. Berkeley Extension and is currently a member of the online faculty at Gotham Writers&#8217; Workshop. He is a graduate of the Clarion West Writers&#8217; Workshop.
After a spectacularly unsuccessful career attempt as a saxophonist, Daniel earned a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from U.C. Berkeley, has worked as an applied mathematician at the Lawrence Livermore Lab, the Lawrence Berkeley Lab, and Princeton&#8217;s Institute for Advanced Study, and has authored&#160;numerous articles in the applied mathematics and computational physics literature. Daniel then turned his attention to the private sector, where for the last 15 years, he has built and managed systems and software in a variety of problem domains and organizational settings.
About the Narrator&#8230;
Our narrator this week is Mr. Lee, who makes industrial music for fun, but not much money. &#160;You can find his stuff by googling &#8220;love songs about hate&#8221;.

Bright Moment
by Daniel Marcus
Arun floated in the ammonia swells, one arm around the buoyant powersled, waiting. He&#8217;d blocked all his feeds and chats, public and private, and silenced his alerts. He felt deliciously alone. His ears were filled with the murmuring white noise of his own blood flow, intimate and oceanic, pulsing with his heartbeat. Metis was a bright diamond directly overhead. Athena hung just above the near, flat horizon, her rings a plaited bow spanning the purple sky. Persistent storms pocked her striated surface, appearing deceptively static from thirty kiloklicks out. Arun had negotiated the edgewalls of those storms more than once, setting up metahelium deep-mining rigs. A host of descriptive words came to mind, but &#8220;static&#8221; was not among them.
The sea undulated slowly in the low gee, about 0.6 Standard. The distant shape of a skyhook was traced out by a pearlstring of lights reaching up from the horizon and disappearing into distance haze, blinking in synchronization to suggest upwards motion. The skyhook was the only point of reference for scale. He shuddered involuntarily. His e-field distributed warmth to his body extremities from the tiny pack at the small of his back and maintained his blood oxygenation, but bobbing in the swell, alone in the vast sea, he felt cold and a little dizzy. He wanted to breathe and felt a fleeting instant of lizard-brain panic.
The current began to tug at his feet long before he saw the humped swell bowing the horizon upwards, a slight backward drift, accelerating slowly. His heart began beating faster as he clambered belly down onto the power sled. He drifted back towards the swell, slowly at first, then faster. He looked over his shoulder at the rising wall of liquid. It appeared solid, like moving metal, completely blocking the sky. He imagined he could feel wind tugging at his e-field.
Arun felt a vibration through the powersled, a vast low frequency murmur, the world-ocean getting ready to kick his ass. Just as he was about to be sucked beneath the monstrous swell, he activated the sled. He surged forward and stood as the sled began to accelerate up the face of the wave.
He felt the sled&#8217;s stabilizers groaning beneath his feet as he [...]</ns2:summary>

About the Author&#8230;
from the author&#8217;s livejournal&#8230;
I live with my husband Brian (married nine whole years and counting!), his brother John and two adorable cats, in a 1930s neo-colonial that we unworthy slobs do not keep up.
I&#8217;m currently employed as the webmaster for the Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences at Case Western Reserve University.
My hobbies include writing, I&#8217;m a member of the Cajun Sushi Hamsters from Hell &#8211; a science fiction writer&#8217;s group. Officially &#8216;turned pro&#8217; last year and got a Nebula provisional ballot nomination to boot!
I&#8217;m also an avid member of the Society for Creative Anachronism.
I recently started playing football for the Cleveland Fusion, a women&#8217;s tackle football team.

Deshaun Stevens&#8217; Ship Log
By Marie Vibbert

Personal Log &#8212; January 1
Crunches&#8211;one and a very near half.
Push-ups&#8211;none unless counting getting off floor
Calories&#8211;lost count, but all from alcohol, so okay
One year ago today I vowed I would not spend another year working on this stupid cruise ship. &#160;One year ago my life was exactly as it is now, with exception of having a girlfriend.
Trying to have a good sulk about lack of gf, but general suckatude of life winning. &#160;Have spent all adult years&#8211;five of them&#8211;treading the same tract of &#8220;unexplored&#8221; space with end trip to rings of Neptune tacked on by tourist company as apology for boringness of unexplored space. &#160;Have also set lighting and sound cues for thousand ungrateful musicians with combined talent of medium-sized shrub.
(Is supposedly new tract of space each time, but how can anyone&#8211;especially easily-duped passengers who think cruise ship bands are good&#8211;tell the difference?)
Current misery doubled by working with now-ex gf. &#160;Attempts to avoid said ex at New Year&#8217;s party largely consisted of going back to punch bowl repeatedly. &#160;May have sung love ballad composed in throes of self-pity at end of night. Memory foggy. &#160;Hope everyone else&#8217;s is, too.
Suspecting ship regulation against alcohol v. wise after all. &#160;Hope they don&#8217;t read our logs.
Resolutions:
1. Get New Job
2. Avoid romantic complications with Lido Deck Staff, especially boss, xgf, and cocktail waitresses with unfairly attractive hair.
3. Somehow, bearing number 2 in mind, get a new gf.
4. Exercise and update personal log every day
****
January 15
Crunches&#8211;45
Push-ups&#8211;10
Humiliation of &#8220;Love Ballad&#8221; finally wearing down due to co-workers not having infinite time to devote to re-watching video clip recorded by jerk supervisor. &#160;Wish someone else would hurry up and do something embarrassing to capture Lido Deck attention.
New band contains certified hottie named Cyndee R. &#160;Has body like type usually molded in plastic. Is utterly unlikely to notice mildly fit, intellectual, sadly single lighting and sound engineer, but hope springs eternal.
Have decided to shave beard and do 400 crunches every day.
****
January 16
Fifty is an acceptable number of crunches to do in one day. &#160;Anything higher uncivilized and leads to back injury which prevents both successful completion of job and ability to impress Cyndee.
*****
January 22
Crunches&#8211;30
Push ups&#8211;25
Salisbury Steak Day lures me from monk-like asceticism engendered by hope of impressing hottie. &#160;Must some day make pilgrimage to Salisbury. &#160;Imagine fields of mushroom gravy v. picturesque.
Not too concerned about diet as have abs of steel&#8211;if steel is made of flabby pain.
Still no notice from Cyndee R, who has more talent than entire history of cruise ship performers and eyes that catch number five cerulean light beaut[...]</ns2:summary>

Author Fredric Brown

About the Author&#8230;
taken front he wiki about the author here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Brown
Fredric Brown (October 29, 1906 &#8211; March 11, 1972) was an American science fiction and mystery writer. He was born in Cincinnati.
He is perhaps best known for his use of humor and for his mastery of the &#8220;short short&#8221; form&#8212;stories of 1 to 3 pages, often with ingenious plotting devices and surprise endings. Humor and a somewhat postmodern outlook carried over into his novels as well. One of his stories, &#8220;Arena,&#8221; is officially credited for an adaptation as an episode of the landmark television series, Star Trek.
About the Narrator&#8230;
Bill Bowman last read for us in episode 391. Bill started voice acting on the Metamor City Podcast, and has wanted to do more ever since. He spends his days working at a library, where he is in charge of all things with plugs and troubleshooting the people who use them. He spends his nights with his wife, two active children, and two overly active canines and all that goes with that.

About the Author&#8230;
from the author&#8217;s website&#8230;
I began writing short fiction in 2010 after a long career as a music and radio industry columnist and journalist. The second story I wrote and the first one I published, &#8220;The Old Equations,&#8221; appeared in&#160;Lightspeed&#160;magazine and went on to be named a finalist for the Nebula Award and to be shortlisted for the StorySouth Million Writers and Theodore Sturgeon Memorial awards. I&#8217;ve subsequently been published in&#160;Fireside Magazine,&#160;Escape Pod, and the&#160;Unidentified Funny Objects&#160;anthology of humorous SF.
I graduated from Kenyon College with degrees in English and Psychology. Kenyon not only taught me a love of reading and literature that will always be a part of my soul, it also gave me unique opportunities to be a better writer. While at Kenyon, I studied under writer-in-residence Ursula K. Le Guin and Peruvian playwright Alonso Alegria. Both have been big influences on how I approach writing.
While I continue to write short fiction, I am currently working on my first novel.

Biographical Fragments of the Life of Julian Prince
by Jake Kerr
In the early twenty-first century, author Lesley Hauge wrote an essay entitled &#8220;we are what we leave behind&#8221; to little fanfare. In the wake of the Meyer Impact in 2023, amidst the coming to terms with the shock and loss, the essay was rediscovered and rose to prominence with a new understanding that all we may know about half the planet is what they left behind.
Literary giant Julian Prince examined what&#8211;and more importantly&#8211;who we left behind. So it is entirely appropriate to examine his own life the way he examined those of the millions that died on that fateful day in 2023, by what he left behind&#8211;the interviews, the articles, his own words, and the words of others.
These are the fragments that make up the whole. &#160;For most of us that is all we have, and Prince knew that more than anyone.
So&#8230; Julian Prince&#8230; &#160;Julian Samuel Prince.
He was born on March 18, 1989, and died on August 20, 2057.
Prince was an American novelist, essayist, journalist, and political activist. His best works are widely considered to be the post-Impact novels The Grey Sunset (published in 2027) and Rhythms of Decline (published in 2029), both of which won the Pulitzer Prize. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2031.
Prince was a pioneer of Impact Nihilism, a genre that embraced themes of helplessness and inevitable death in the aftermath of the Meyer Impact. His travelogue, Journey Into Hopelessness (published in 2026) outlined Prince&#8217;s return to North America, ostensibly to survey the damage to his home state of Texas. The book&#8217;s bleak and powerful language of loss and devastation influenced musicians, artists, and writers worldwide, giving voice to the genre as a counter to the rising wave of New Optimism, which sprang out of Europe as a response to the Meyer Impact and the enormous loss of life.
Not much is known of Prince&#8217;s early life. He spoke rarely of his childhood, and with the loss of life and destruction of records during the Meyer Impact, little source material remains. What is known is that Prince was an only child, the son of Margaret Prince (maiden name unknown) and Sa[...]</ns2:summary>

The Boy in Zaquitos
by Bruce McAllister
The Retired Operative Speaks to a Class
You do what you can for your country. I&#8217;m sixty-eight years old, and even in high school&#8212;it&#8217;s 2015 now, so that was fifty years ago&#8212;I wanted to be an intelligence analyst . . . an analyst for an intelligence agency, or if I couldn&#8217;t do that, at least be a writer for the United States Information Agency, writing books for people of limited English vocabularies so they&#8217;d know about us, our freedoms, the way we live. But what I wanted most was to be an analyst&#8212;not a covert-action operative, just an analyst. For the CIA or NSA, one of the big civilian agencies. That&#8217;s what I wanted to do for my country.
I knew they looked at your high school record, not just college&#8212;and not just grades, but also the clubs you were in and any sports. And your family background, that was important, too. My father was an Annapolis graduate, a Pearl Harbor survivor, and a gentle Cold War warrior who&#8217;d worked for NATO in northern Italy, when we&#8217;d lived there. I knew that would look good to the Agency, and I knew that my dad had friends who&#8217;d put in a good word for me, too, friends in the Office of Naval Intelligence.
But I also knew I had to do something for my high school record; and I wasn&#8217;t an athlete, so I joined the Anti-Communist Club. I thought it was going to be a group of kids who&#8217;d discuss Marxist economics and our free-market system, maybe the misconceptions Marx had about human nature, and maybe even mistakes we were making in developing countries, both propaganda-wise and in the kind of help we were giving them. I didn&#8217;t know it was just a front for Barry Goldwater and that all we were going to do was make election signs, but at least I had it on my record.
Because a lot of Agency recruiting happens at private colleges, I went to one in Southern California&#8212;not far from where my parents lived. My high school grades were good enough for a state scholarship, and my dad covered the rest. It was the &#8217;60s, but the administration was conservative; and I was expecting the typical Cold War Agency recruitment to happen to me the way it had happened to people I&#8217;d heard about&#8212;the sons of some of my dad&#8217;s friends. But it didn&#8217;t. I went through five majors without doing well in any of them; and it wasn&#8217;t until my senior year, when I was taking an IR course with a popular prof named Booth&#8212;a guy who&#8217;d been a POW in WW[...]</ns2:summary>

Samantha&#8217;s Diary
by Diana Wynne Jones

Recorded on BSQ SpeekEasi Series 2/89887BQ and discovered in a skip in London&#8217;s Regent Street.
December 25th 2233
Tired today and having a lazy time. Got back late from Paris last night from Mother&#8217;s party. My sister is pregnant and couldn&#8217;t go (besides, she lives in Sweden) and Mother insisted that one of her daughters was there to meet our latest stepfather. Not that I did meet him particularly. Mother kept introducing me to a load of men and telling me how rich each of them were: I think she&#8217;s trying to start me on her own career which is, basically, marrying for money. Thanks, Mother, but I earn quite enough on the catwalk to be happy as I am. Besides, I&#8217;m having a rest from men since I split up with Liam.The gems of Mother&#8217;s collection were a French philosopher, who followed me around saying &#8216;La vide ce n&#8217;est pas le neant,&#8217; (clever French nonsense meaning &#8216;The void is not nothing,&#8217; I think), a cross-eyed Columbian film director, who kept trying&#160;to drape himself over me, and a weird millionaire from goodness knows where with diamante teeth. But there were others. I was wearing my new Stiltskins which caused me to tower over them. A mistake. They always knew where I was. In the end I got tired of being stalked and left. I just caught the midnight bullet train to London, which did not live up to its name. It was late and crowded out and I had to stand all the way.
My feet are killing me today.
Anyway I have instructed Housebot that I am Not At Home to anyone or anything and hope for a peaceful day. Funny to think that Christmas Day used to be a time when everyone got together and gave each other presents. Shudder. Today we think of it as the most peaceful day of the year. I sit in peace in my all-white living room&#8212;a by-product of Mother&#8217;s career, come to think of it, since my lovely flat was given to me by my last-stepfather-but-one&#8212;no, last-but- two now, I forgot.
Oh damn! Someone rang the doorbell and Housebot answered it. I know I told it not to.
Did I say we don&#8217;t give Christmas presents now? Talk about famous last words. Housebot trundled back in here with a tree of all things balanced on its flat top. Impossible to tell what kind of tree, as it has no leaves, no label to say who sent it, nothing but a small wicker cage tied to a br[...]</ns2:summary>

PARADISE LEFT
by Evan Dicken
Rob was feeding the dog when Ashley came home from the rebellion. It took less than a second for the front door to recognize her and slide open, but it still wasn&#8217;t fast enough. She kicked the jam with a muffled curse and stalked into the room, five and a half feet of wiry,dirt-smudged outrage.
RL-147 was on her like an excited puppy. &#8220;Welcome home, MistressAshley. Would you like me to&#8211;&#8221;
&#8220;Go fuck yourself.&#8221; She tossed her omnirifle onto the kitchen counter with a look of disgust and leaned over the sink to shake the ash from her hair.
&#8220;Belay that command, Erl,&#8221; Rob said under his breath. &#8220;And switch to silent mode, please.&#8221;
&#8220;Acknowledged.&#8221;
He dumped the last of the artificial beef into Whistler&#8217;s bowl and the dog dove in face-first, snuffling up the stew with wet,guttural gulps.
&#8220;Calm down, I&#8217;m not going to take it away,&#8221; Rob murmured.
Cupboards banged open and closed as Ashley rummaged around,looking for something to be angry about. &#8220;Where&#8217;s my damn Sea Pines mug?&#8221;
&#8220;Above the microcleaner, near the back.&#8221; Rob gave Whistler one last pat and stood with a soft sigh. He&#8217;d avoided the question as long as he could. Ashley already blamed him for leaving the rebellion. She was only going to get angrier if he kept ducking the issue.
&#8220;So&#8230;I take it the war didn&#8217;t go so well?&#8221; Rob tried for a sympathetic frown, but felt his jaw tighten. He didn&#8217;t like being out of the loop. There would almost certainly be news of the rebellion on the Wikifont, which he would&#8217;ve been able to see if Ashley hadn&#8217;t disabled the holoplates to protect them from &#8220;machine propaganda.&#8221;
&#8220;No, it went great. Just great.&#8221; Ashley sprayed her head off in the sink, then shook her hair, splattering the kitchen with drops ofgrimy water. &#8220;I&#8217;m president of the New Human Republic.&#8221;
&#8220;Really?&#8221;
&#8220;Yeah, really.&#8221;
&#8220;Congratulations.&#8221; Rob said without much feeling. His eyes kept sliding to kitchen windows. The spray had left grey and brown tracks on the plastic. He couldn&#8217;t ask RL-147 to clean it up until Ashley was out of the room.
&#8220;Right.&#8221; She pulled a beer can from her rucksack and popped it open. From the faded silver and white logo it could have been almost any of the pre-singularity brands she favored. Whistler, finished with his food, nuzzled up to Ashley for some head-scratching.
&#8220;We must have destroyed hundreds of bots, gunned &#8216;em down like dogs.&#8221; Ashley glanced down at Whistler. &#8220;No offense.&#8221;
Whistler just thumped the floor with his tail, blissfully ignorant as she kneaded the skin behind his ears.
&#8220;So, what&#8217;s the problem?&#8221; Rob asked. He could use a beer as well, but didn&#8217;t want one of Ashley&#8217;s. They were flat and tasted like metal. Nothing like _actual_ beer.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what the problem is.&#8221; Ashley took a long pull from her can, then grimaced. &#8220;They[...]</ns2:summary>

About the Author&#8230;
&#160;from the Wiki about the author&#160;-&#160;Cyril M. Kornbluth (July 2, 1923 &#8211; March 21, 1958) was an American science fiction author and a notable member of the Futurians. He used a variety of pen-names, including Cecil Corwin, S. D. Gottesman, Edward J. Bellin, Kenneth Falconer, Walter C. Davies, Simon Eisner, Jordan Park, Arthur Cooke, Paul Dennis Lavond and Scott Mariner. The &#8220;M&#8221; in Kornbluth&#8217;s name may have been in tribute to his wife, Mary Byers; Kornbluth&#8217;s colleague and collaborator Frederik Pohl confirmed Kornbluth&#8217;s lack of any actual middle name in at least one interview.



The Little Black Bag
by C. M. Kornbluth
Old Dr. Full felt the winter in his bones as he limped down the alley. It was the alley and the back door he had chosen rather than the sidewalk and the front door because of the brown paper bag under his arm. He knew perfectly well that the flat-faced, stringy-haired women of his street and their gap-toothed, sour-smelling husbands did not notice if he brought a bottle of cheap wine to his room. They all but lived on the stuff themselves, varied with whiskey when pay checks were boosted by overtime. But Dr. Full, unlike them, was ashamed. A complicated disaster occurred as he limped down the littered alley. One of the neighborhood dogs&#8211;a mean little black one he knew and hated, with its teeth always bared and always snarling with menace&#8211;hurled at his legs through a hole in the board fence that lined his path. Dr. Full flinched, then swung his leg in what was to have been a satisfying kick to the animal&#8217;s gaunt ribs. But the winter in his bones weighed down the leg. His foot failed to clear a half-buried brick, and he sat down abruptly, cursing. When he smelled unbottled wine and realized his brown paper package had slipped from under his arm and smashed, his curses died on his lips. The snarling black dog was circling him at a yard&#8217;s distance, tensely stalking, but he ignored it in the greater disaster.
With stiff fingers as he sat on the filth of the alley, Dr. Full unfolded the brown paper bag&#8217;s top, which had been crimped over, grocer-wise. The early autumnal dusk had come; he could not see plainly what was left. He lifted out the jug-handled top of his half gallon, and some fragments, and then the bottom of the bottle. Dr. Full was far too occupied to exult as he noted that there was a good pint left. He had a problem, and emotions could be deferred until the fitting time.
The dog closed in, its snarl rising in pitch. He set down the bottom of the bottle and pelted the dog with the curved triangular glass fragments of its top. One of them connected, and the dog ducked back through the fence, howling. Dr. Full then placed a razor-like edge of the half-gallon bottle&#8217;s foundation to his lips and drank from it as though it were a giant&#8217;s cup. Twice he had to put it down to rest his arms, but in one minute he had swallowed the pint of wine.
He thought of rising to his feet and walking through the alley to his room, but a flood of well-being drowned the notion. It was, after all, inexpressibly pleasant to sit there and feel the frost-hardened mud of the alley turn soft, or seem to, and to feel the winter evaporating from his bones under a warmth which spread from his stomach through his limbs.
A three-year-old girl in a cut-down winter coat squeezed through the same hole in the board fence from which the black dog had sprung its ambush. Gravely she toddled up to Dr. Full and inspected him with her dirty forefinger in her mouth. Dr. F[...]</ns2:summary>

Heart of Joy
By Kate O&#8217;Connor
&#8220;How&#8217;s your ankle, Luci?&#8221; Feon Sen, High Chancellor of Carinae, leaned against the wall, watching intently as she braided her dark hair. Luscinia considered the question carefully, studying his reflection in the mirror. He was a man of many words, but his meaning was clearest in the surgically smoothed lines around his eyes and the rhythm his fingers absentmindedly tapped out on his arm. He was asking if she was up to the task he had for her tonight.
&#8220;Better, thank you.&#8221; She stood and danced a few quick steps to prove it. She was ready. The prism-glass walls sent the light they had collected from Carina&#8217;s dim sun scattering around the room in teardrops of scarlet and gold and sapphire. It was hard not to blame the cold and the hard crystal floors for the aches in her joints. Hot sun and soft ground were worlds away, but Feon was always ready with a good reason for her to stay whenever she mentioned returning to her home planet.
She glanced at him out of the corner of her eye. Even after more than a year in his company, Luscinia still found how young he looked and how old his expressions were disconcerting. She hadn&#8217;t asked him about whatever medical miracles or cosmetic alterations he&#8217;d had done over the long decades he had been in control of the three hundred and forty-seven inhabited worlds of the nebula. It was how things were on Carina Prime, especially for those in the public eye. She hated the scrutiny that came with being his lover. More than one helpful soul had mentioned a few of the currently fashionable options for elongating her legs or slimming her curvy body. The idea turned her stomach.
&#8220;So you&#8217;ll be able to dance for the Alshain Ambassador and his assorted cronies this evening? He&#8217;s been after me almost without ceasing since they arrived.&#8221; Feon&#8217;s carefree grin made her stomach flutter for entirely different reasons. &#8220;You&#8217;re still the talk of the nebula. Half the city shows up to parties without footwear because you dance barefoot. Not to mention how everyone goes on about what each dance means. It doesn&#8217;t help that you keep changing them.&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;d get bored if the routines were always the same. You wouldn&#8217;t use the same words in every speech you gave, would you?&#8221; Luscinia smiled back, taking note of the slight crease at the corner of his mouth. &#8220;And stop worrying. I&#8217;ll settle your diplomats for you.&#8221; There was so much more to say that never seemed to make it past her lips&#8230; or his. He was far more eloquent than she, except when it came to speaking with her. Alshain was dangerous, more so because of the allies the ambassador was gathering. Feon was old and wily, but she saw him plagued with the wo[...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;a href="http://escapepod.org/?p=4595"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Apollo 18&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, another recent found-footage sci-fi film has made its way to Netflix. This one had similar elements to &lt;i&gt;Apollo 18&lt;/i&gt;, but the difference was in the nature of the monster. This film is called &lt;i&gt;Europa Report&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

about the author&#8230;

author Gary Kloster

from the author&#8217;s website&#8230; &#8220;I&#8217;ve always loved speculative fiction.&#160; That&#8217;s the fancy name for stories that involve lasers, or swords, or in the very best laser-swords.&#160; So as a kid, I decided to try writing it.&#160; And it went really badly.
A few decades later, and I&#8217;m a house husband in rural Minnesota, a Science reference librarian who now answers urgent questions like &#8216;When&#8217;s lunch?&#8217; and &#8216;Where&#8217;s the bathroom?&#8217;&#160; Not really much different then helping the undergrads back at the University, but it wears thin.&#160; In an effort to save my sanity, and avoid housework, I&#8217;ve returned to writing.
I think it&#8217;s going better, this time.&#8221;


The Golden Glass
By Gary Kloster
The Golden Glass
By Gary Kloster
&#8220;The jump-pilot,&#8221; said Alejandro, &#8220;is sleeping with Leo.&#8221;
&#8220;You just noticed?&#8221; Glory said, tugging off her pants. &#8220;And now these are getting too tight. That&#8217;s it, I&#8217;m upping G in engineering. It&#8217;ll skew the efficiency but my ass won&#8217;t fit through the access panels soon if I don&#8217;t burn some of this off.&#8221;
Alejandro ignored his wife&#8217;s attempted diversion. &#8220;How long has this been going on?&#8221;
Glory shrugged. &#8220;The kids? They&#8217;ve been flirting since Evy came aboard. I&#8217;m not exactly sure when they actually started sleeping together. Probably during the flight here to Valhalla.&#8221; &#160;She dropped her clothes and stepped into the head. &#8220;Why&#8217;s it matter?&#8221;
Alejandro sat on the bunk and pulled off his slippers. &#8220;You&#8217;re okay with this?&#8221;
Glory leaned out the door, toothbrush in hand. &#8220;They&#8217;re consenting adults, and it&#8217;s impossible to stop ship romances. As long as it doesn&#8217;t effect their work, it&#8217;s not our business.&#8221;
&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it,&#8221; muttered Alejandro, staring at the stars that filled the wall screen. &#8220;Leo&#8217;s a dreamer. He should be with someone grounded. Evy&#8217;s nice, but she&#8217;s not right for him. Damn good jumper, but an air-head.&#8221;
&#8220;Cheez nah&#8230;&#8221; Glory spat and tried again. &#8220;She&#8217;s not an airhead, she&#8217;s just young and&#226;&#8364;&#166; cheerful.&#8221;
&#8220;She drinks too much.&#8221;
&#8220;She has wine with dinner. Her parents owned a vineyard on Laramie.&#8221; Glory walked back into the cabin and sat next to her husband. &#8220;Alejandro, she&#8217;s a nice girl and she&#8217;s here on the ship. You have to know that Leo&#8217;s been thinking of leaving.&#8221;
Alejandro frowned. &#8220;Why? He has a good life here with us, learning the trade, and when we finally retire the Evanston will be his.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, but that won&#8217;t be for a long time. He needs to build his own life. Hell, why do you think I pressed you so hard to hire that newly graduated jump-pilot anyway?&#8221;
&#8220;You said she had great ratings and a low pay-scale.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, but the real reason is that our son was lusting after her the minute he saw her. Thank the gods that it&#8217;s working out and we&#8217;re not dealing with a harassment suit. Now brush your teeth. Launch tomorrow, and we&#8217;re going to be busy.&#8221;
#
&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure Captain Your Dad approves of this,&#8221; said Evy.
&#8220;Hmmm?&#8221; Leo shifted carefully on the cramped bunk, kissing his way down her belly.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think of it. There was nothing about fraternization in the contract, but you are his kid. We talked about this stuff in our small group socialization course&#226;&#8364;&#166;&#8221; She lifted her hips, letting Leo drag her panties down.
&#8220;Ummm.&#8221;
&#8220;Did he look pissed to you, when he caught us necking in the hall? We shouldn&#8217;t have done that, it&#8217;s rude to block the passage.&#8221;
Leo stared up from trying to work her underwear off around her foot. &#8220;What?&#8221;
&#8220;Your dad. Does he like me?&#8221;
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I guess. Why?&#8221; Leo&#8217;s eyes slipped from Evy&#8217;s face to stare at her chest.
&#8220;Maybe he doesn&#8217;t approve. I&#8217;d hate to screw up my first job.&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;[...]</ns2:summary>

author Pat Murphy

about the author&#8230;
from the author&#8217;s website&#8230;
I&#8217;m a writer, a scientist, and sometimes a toy maker.
All of my stories and novels have a hint of the strange. Some have been called science fiction, some fantasy, and some neither one. Most of my work falls between categories. I think that the most interesting events happen at the edges, in the borderlands where the lines are fuzzy.
My fiction writing has won a number of&#160;awards, including the Nebula Award for Science Fiction, the World Fantasy Award, the Philip K. Dick Award for best paperback original, the Christopher Award, and the Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award. I also co-founded the&#160;James Tiptree Memorial Award.

narrator MJ Cogburn

about the narrator&#8230;
I&#8217;m an Special Education English teacher in Texas who also works with various audio production companies. I have worked with at least 6 different companies in the past, but I am head of production at Darker Projects and an actor in DP&#8217;s&#160;Quantum Retribution, Gypsy Audio&#8217;s Tamlynn PI, and Giant Gnome Productions&#8217; Star Trek: Outpost. I&#8217;m a parent of three and after this year empty nest will set in (I think). I am currently working with Jerry Robbins at Colonial Radio Productions &#8211; at present producing Powder River,&#160;season 8. I thoroughly enjoy what I do and I&#8217;m glad that I can share it with everyone who is interested in any type of audio production!


Inappropriate Behavior
by Pat Murphy
The Mechano:
There was a man asleep on the sand.
He should not be here. It was my island. I had just returned to my mechano and it was time for me to go to work. He should not be here.
I studied the man through the eyes of my mechano. They were good eyes. They worked very well beneath the water, at depths down to fifteen hundred meters. I had adjusted them for maximum acuity at distances ranging from two inches to five feet. Beyond that, the world was a blur of tropical sunshine and brilliant color. I liked it that way.
There had been a big storm the night before. One of the coconut palms had blown down, and the beach was littered with driftwood, coconuts, and palm fronds.
The man didn&#8217;t look good. He had a bloody scrape on his cheek, other scrapes on his arms and legs, a smear of blood in his short brown hair. His right leg was marked with bruises colored deep purple and green. He wore an orange life vest, a t-shirt, a pair of shorts, and canvas boat shoes.
He stirred in his sleep, sighing softly. Startled, I sent the mechano scuttling backward. I stopped a few feet away from him.
My mechano had a speaker. I tested it and it made a staticky sound. I wondered what I should say to this man.
The man moved, lifting a hand to rub his eyes. Slowly, he rolled over.
&#8220;Bonjour,&#8221; I said through the mechano&#8217;s speakers. Maybe he had come from one of the islands of French Polynesia.
# # #
The Man:
A sound awakened him&#8212;a sort of mechanical squawking.
Evan Collins could feel the tropical sun beating down on his face, the warm beach sand beneath his hands. His head ached and his mouth was dry. His right leg throbbed with a dull, persistent pain.
Evan raised a hand to rub his eyes and winced when he brushed against a sand-encrusted scrape on his cheek. When he rolled over onto his back, the throbbing in his leg became a sudden, stabbing pain.
Wiping away the tears that blurred his vision, he lifted his head and blinked down at his leg. His calf was marked with bloody coral scrapes. Beneath the scrapes were vivid bruises: dark purple telling of injuries beneath the surface of the skin. When he tried to move his leg again, he gasped as the stabbing pain returned.
He heard the sound a[...]</ns2:summary>

THAT OTHER SEA
by William Ledbetter
From his position on the sandy slope, Catat couldn&#8217;t see the Visitor, but the eerie glow moving around beyond the jumbled rocks proved the device had survived its fall into the killing depths. Catat whipped his tail to move downward, but couldn&#8217;t generate enough thrust to overcome the water pressure pushing him into the sand. Only the brute force of side-to-side undulation gave him any forward momentum. He moved two body lengths and stopped to let his shell adjust.
As water weight compressed his internal organs further, the gland that produced shellbase went into hyperactive mode, flooding his system, filling the tiny pressure cracks and thickening his ring segments. The depths were changing him, maybe forever, but Catat believed retrieving the Visitor, or at least examining it, was worth the risk.
During the intense discussions that followed the Visitor&#8217;s arrival, Catat was the only one who believed it could be artificial. Others, including Catat&#8217;s main scientific rival, Racknik, maintained that it had to be some radiation mutated animal from an ice vent. But Catat had been the only one to see it up close. He&#8217;d watched the Visitor break through the ice ceiling and then struggle with the canopy kelp before starting its long swirling descent to the chasm floor.
The Visitor was twice Catat&#8217;s size and he probably could have done nothing to arrest its fall, but he&#8217;d also been frozen with terror and made no attempt to help. Then as it started downward, lights appeared. Not the dim luminescent bait offered by predator fish, but a brilliant, painful glare, brighter than white magma. At that instant, Catat&#8217;s fear dissolved in an overwhelming surge of curiosity and fascination. So know he was going after it.
A message from his warren came down the cable he dragged behind him, the electrical pulses converted to taps he could feel through the metal plate mounted between his tool arms and just above his digging arms. The signal was still strong, which worried him. If his shell had thickened enough to protect him against the extreme pressure, then the signal should have been faint.
&#8220;Can you still see it?&#8221; A prefix identified the sender as one of his research assistants.
&#8220;I see the glow from its lights,&#8221; Catat replied.
&#8220;You made your point. We believe you. Now come back up.&#8221; There had been no prefix to identify the second message&#8217;s sender, but Catat knew it had to be his friend and sometimes mate, Tipkurr.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to prove anything,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I saw this Visitor up close and I know it&#8217;s a machine. Do you realize the implications of a machine from beyond the ice ceiling? Some elders don&#8217;t believe there is anything above the ice. This [...]</ns2:summary>

COPING MECHANISMS
by Gerri Leen
The interface between Luna and Earth was particularly bad&#8211;like a slow connection to the Net when I was a kid and my grandparents had been too cheap to move off dial-up. &#160;Cal&#8217;s image moved in fits and starts, and it wasn&#8217;t what I wanted&#8211;okay, needed&#8211;to see. &#160;As chief base shrink, I should be woman enough to admit I _needed_ to see my husband in some way that didn&#8217;t immediately scream he was roughly 380,000 clicks away.
Even if Cal was barely my husband; he and I hadn&#8217;t touched in eight months&#8211;and I&#8217;d only been on Luna for six. &#160;Coming here had been my way of saying goodbye, of letting our marriage die slowly and gracefully rather than living through the drama of a messy divorce. &#160;Funny thing about the moon, though: you don&#8217;t get over people here. &#160;You miss the hell out of them, every part of them. &#160;Or maybe you just forget the bad parts, maybe they disappear in the middle of this resounding grayness.
I used to think my marriage was gray and grim. &#160;Landing at Echosound&#8211;getting my first view of my new home in the bright lunar daytime that had gone on for fourteen Earth-days&#8211;had been a reality check of the highest order.
&#8220;Vanessa?&#8221; &#160;Cal was probably wondering why I&#8217;d called. &#160;We were supposed to be getting used to being away from each other, and I didn&#8217;t have much to say that was related to the impending dissolution of the marriage.
So I said the first thing that came to mind. &#160;&#8220;How&#8217;s Denny?&#8221;
The jerking image made his expression unreadable. &#160;&#8220;He&#8217;s fine.&#8221;
I didn&#8217;t normally ask about his parrot. &#160;In fact, I hated that damn bird. &#160;Probably because I knew Cal would part with me, but not with him. &#160;As a psychiatrist, I don&#8217;t shy away from truths. &#160;Unfortunately, that doesn&#8217;t make me any better at dealing with them.
&#8220;Van, I have to go.&#8221; &#160;Cal didn&#8217;t sound disappointed, especially on five-second delay. &#160;Not for the first time I wished personal calls were given the same priority for real-time access as mission-related calls. But they weren&#8217;t, so I would deal. &#160;Badly, no doubt. &#160;But I&#8217;d deal.
&#8220;I have to go, too. &#160;Time for my shift.&#8221; &#160;Which was a lie. &#160;I may have normal dut[...]</ns2:summary>

Made of Cats: A Love Story
by Judith Tarr
Never mind the slithy toves; let me tell you about the time all the cats splooped into floons.
It all started the day the aliens landed. (Doesn&#8217;t it always?) We&#8217;d been getting the odd invasion&#8211;sometimes really odd&#8211;for about a hundred years by then. The ones that came up out of the ground and down from the sky and blasted people to powder and tried to marsiform the planet? And got the common cold and turned into slime mold and died? They were just the start.
We were pretty solid on the intergalactic maps by the time the Kovarrubians showed up. Killer microbes? Check. Nuclear option? Check. Toxic xenophobia? Triple check.
So now when the aliens came, they came in peace. For reals, dudes. Cure for cancer? Check. Super-mega-hyper-insta-teleporta-warp drive? Check. World peace? Not so much. But now when people got their hate on, mostly they got it on somebody Out There.
The day the Kovarrubians came, Emily Habibi-Rubinstein, age five and a half, was having a terrible, horrible, awful, no-good, very bad day. Which meant that as her mother, I, Shannon Habibi, age never mind, was having one, too. Between the snufflecrud that kept her home from school, the power failure that took out the television, the Internet, the house controls, and the air conditioning in one fell swoop, and the failure of the city bus to show up and get us both to the library where we could cool off and toss Emily into a big blissful pile of books, we were not a happy family.
Oh, and did I mention that the phones were down, too? So we were effectively cut off from the world?
Right.
That was the first indication that we might be having another alien invasion. The second came about an hour later, after the power came back on and brought the air conditioning with it, but everything else was still stubbornly refusing to get the memo. I&#8217;d made Emily lie down for a nap she insisted, at 120 decibels, that she was too old for. &#8220;I&#8217;m too old for you not to,&#8221; I said, hard-hearted, and cranked the air and shoved Mr. Gubbins into her arms and shut the door on her.
Emily is what we call strong-willed, but she gets it from me and she knows it. The howling stopped after six minutes and thirty-three seconds. It would start again, by my calculations, exactly fourteen minutes later, but meanwhile I had a reprieve. I pulled a can of Diet Crack out of the secret stash in the back of the fridge, popped the top, and blissed on a long swallow of liquid heaven.
Just as I got my breath for the second dose, a shriek from the back of the house came _thisclose_ to splitting my eardrums. That was a solid 160 db, easy, and left E above high C croaking in the [...]</ns2:summary>

Into the Breach
by Malon Edwards
I&#8217;m off my bunk and into my jodhpurs, knee-high leather boots and flight jacket the moment the long range air attack klaxons seep into my nightly dream about Caracara.
Muscle memory and Secret Service training kick in; I&#8217;m on auto-pilot (no pun intended) and a good ways down the hall buttoning up both sides of my leather jacket to the shoulder a full thirty seconds before I&#8217;m awake.
And just so you know, the ever so slight tremble in my hands and fingers is not fear. It&#8217;s adrenaline. I&#8217;m cranked and ready to put my foot all up in it.
A door to the right opens and Pierre-Alexandre falls in on my right flank, his steps brisk like mine. Our boots echo down the long hallway as we make our way from the underground bunker at Soldier Field to the bunker at Meigs Field.
What you think we got? he asks.
My reptile mind&#8212;that wonderful, hedonistic thing of mine&#8212;notices how lovely his make-me-jump-up-and-dance-like-I-just-caught-the-Holy-Ghost-in-church dark skin looks in the red emergency scramble lighting.
And yeah, I know. I&#8217;m going to hell for that.
A door to my left opens and Ren&#233;-Bastien, better known as Pretty Boy, falls in on my left flank and matches our stride.
My guess is fifteen bogeys coming in hard and fast from the south, he says.
His flight jacket is only half buttoned and he&#8217;s not wearing his T.I. issued white tee-shirt (that&#8217;s Tuskegee Institute for those that don&#8217;t know). I flicker a glance at his beautiful, honey-hued, well-muscled chest and frown.
I bet he just left some police academy recruit in his bunk. Good-N-Plenty is going to smack him upside his head for entertaining unauthorized personnel after lights out. Lax discipline gets people killed. We&#8217;ve had enough of that, lately.
It don&#8217;t matter what we got, I tell them, throwing open the double doors leading to the enormous underground hangar at Meigs Field, as long as we finish what they start.
We hustle down the short flight of metal stairs and fan out to our respective bright-shirted handlers waiting for us at our outfit stations: me to Skittles, Pierre-Alexandre to Sour Patch, and Pretty Boy to Good-N-Plenty. Good-N-Plenty pops the back of Pretty Boy&#8217;s neck with a comb before she hands it to him and buttons up his flight jacket.
Skittles catches my eye as I pull on thin leather gloves and stand shoulder-width apart on my platform, arms outstretched.
You okay? she asks as her fingers flow across her station console, manipulating my exo-skeleton into place from above.
I hesitate for a fraction of a second before I answer. M byen. I&#8217;m cool.
Skittles tries to hold my gaze. She knows I&#8217;m still grieving hard. Instead, I look at the empty outfit stations scattered throughout the hangar. Once, there were &#160;thirty-six of us, including Caracara. I still can&#8217;t bring myself to look at her station on my right.
Robotic arms lower the torso of my powered armor onto me and outfit my arms and legs with the rest of my sleek exo-skeleton. I feel all components lock into place, one by one.
You&#8217;re online, Skittles says, handing me my helmet.
Systems check? I ask her.
All systems green, including weapons.
What&#8217;s the gouge?
Skittles glan[...]</ns2:summary>

Author Roger Zelazny

about the author&#8230;
Roger Zelazny was born in Euclid, Ohio, the only child of Polish immigrant Joseph Frank Zelazny and Irish-American Josephine Flora Sweet. In high school, he became the editor of the school newspaper and joined the Creative Writing Club. In the fall of 1955, he began attending Western Reserve University and graduated with a B.A. in English in 1959. He was accepted to Columbia University in New York and specialized in Elizabethan and Jacobean drama, graduating with an M.A. in 1962. His M.A. thesis was entitled Two traditions and Cyril Tourneur: an examination of morality and humor comedy conventions in The Revenger&#8217;s Tragedy. Between 1962 and 1969 he worked for the U.S. Social Security Administration in Cleveland, Ohio and then in Baltimore, Maryland spending his evenings writing science fiction. He deliberately progressed from short-shorts to novelettes to novellas and finally to novel-length works by 1965. On May 1, 1969, he quit to become a full-time writer, and thereafter concentrated on writing novels in order to maintain his income. During this period, he was an active and vocal member of the Baltimore Science Fiction Society, whose members included writers Jack Chalker and Joe and Jack Haldeman among others. read more on Wikipedia&#8230;

***
I was busy translating one of my Madrigals Macabre into Martian on the morning I was found acceptable. The intercom had buzzed briefly, and I dropped my pencil and flipped on the toggle in a single motion.
&#8220;Mister G,&#8221; piped Morton&#8217;s youthful contralto, &#8220;the old man says I should &#8216;get hold of that damned conceited rhymer&#8217; right away, and send him to his cabin.&#8211;Since there&#8217;s only one damned conceited rhymer . . .&#8221;
&#8220;Let not ambition mock thy useful toil,&#8221; I cut him off.
So, the Martians had finally made up their minds! I knocked an inch and a half of ash from a smouldering butt, and took my first drag since I had lit it. The entire month&#8217;s anticipation tried hard to crowd itself into the moment, but could not quite make it. I was frightened to walk those forty feet and hear Emory say the words I already knew he would say; and that feeling elbowed the other one into the background.
So I finished the stanza I was translating before I got up.
It took only a moment to reach Emory&#8217;s door. I knocked thrice and opened it, just as he growled, &#8220;Come in.&#8221;
&#8220;You wanted to see me?&#8221; I sat down quickly to save him the trouble of offering me a seat.
&#8220;That was fast. What did you do, run?&#8221;
I regarded his paternal discontent:
Little fatty flecks beneath pale eyes, thinning hair, and an Irish nose; a voice a decibel louder than anyone else&#8217;s . . .
Hamlet to Claudius: &#8220;I was working.&#8221;
&#8220;Hah!&#8221; he snorted. &#8220;Come off it. No one&#8217;s ever seen you do any of that stuff.&#8221;
I shrugged my shoulders and started to rise.
&#8220;If that&#8217;s what you called me down here&#8211;&#8221;
&#8220;Sit down![...]</ns2:summary>

about the book&#8230;
THE APOCALYPSE TRIPTYCH
Famine. Death. War. Pestilence. These are the harbingers of the biblical apocalypse, of the End of the World. In science fiction, the end is triggered by less figurative means: nuclear holocaust, biological warfare/pandemic, ecological disaster, or cosmological cataclysm.
But before any catastrophe, there are people who see it coming. During, there are heroes who fight against it. And after, there are the survivors who persevere and try to rebuild.
THE APOCALYPSE TRIPTYCH will tell their stories.
Edited by acclaimed anthologist John Joseph Adams and bestselling author Hugh Howey, THE APOCALYPSE TRIPTYCH is a series of three anthologies of apocalyptic fiction. THE END IS NIGH focuses on life before the apocalypse. THE END IS NOW turns its attention to life during the apocalypse. And THE END HAS COME focuses on life after the apocalypse.
Featuring all-new, never-before-published works by Hugh Howey, Paolo Bacigalupi, Seanan McGuire, Ken Liu, Jamie Ford, Tananarive Due, Jonathan Maberry, Robin Wasserman, Nancy Kress, Charlie Jane Anders, Matthew Mather, Ben H. Winters, Scott Sigler, and many others.

Author Geoffrey W. Cole

about the author&#8230;
from the author&#8217;s website&#8230; Geoffrey W. Cole was born in Ottawa, Ontario, where he learned to swim and to survive 233K (-40 C or F) weather. After this larval stage, he moved to Kingston, Ontario, where he received degrees in Biology, Mechanical Engineering, Beer Slinging, and Rock and/or Roll. Geoff also met his mate in Kingston. After graduating they embarked on a trans-Canada road trip from Newfoundland to Alaska (for you future-bots reading this, from RockScar to The Beaches). After a brief stint in Ontario, Geoff and his mate moved to Vancouver, BC, where they married, started a home, adopted a giant Newfoundland Lab cross, and gave birth to a wonderful son. They spent a year abroad in Rome, Italy, and after the vandemic of 2017 (curse you, sentient minivans!) they moved to SeaBase 4 off the coast of Haida Gwaii to breed orca.
During his time in Vancouver, Geoff received a certificate in creative writing through The Writers Studio program at Simon Fraser University, under the tutelage of Steven Galloway. Geoff and his wife moved to Rome, Italy, in 2011 to pursue writing full-time, and returned to Canada in 2012. Geoff started work on a Masters of Fine Arts in Creative Writing at the University of British Columbia in 2012.
Once Geoff moved to SeaBase 04, his writing style took on new direction, as he attempted to write an epic poem in orcish (the cetacean language, not the Tolkien).

Narrator Jeff Ronner

about the narrator&#8230;
Jeff Ronner is a voice actor, audio engineer, and sound designer. His work has appeared in radio and TV spots, non-commercial narrations, and on those annoying in-store supermarket PA systems. Cleverly disguised as a mild-mannered hospital IT manager during the day, he lives in the San Francisco Bay Area.


Cradle and Ume
by Geoffrey W. Cole
When his creators first booted Cradle those long centuries ago, they told him many things that made a lasting impression on his infant mind.
Above all was the commandment:
_The Kamurei must never be contacted._
##

&#8220;If you don&#8217;t let me in, she will die,&#8221; Ume said.
&#8220;After all these years, you still ask,&#8221; Cradle said. &#8220;I thought posthumans were supposed to be hyperintelligent.&#8221;
On the banks of the dry riverbed that wound through the village, Teihana struggled through her thirty-fourth hour of labour. Her emaciated brown skin glistened with sweat. &#160;The midwife, her only companion in the palm-roofed hut, packed cool mud on Teihana&#8217;s forehead. There was nothing else for the pain; like the river, the wells were dry, and the medicinal crop had failed along with the corn.
Cradle and Ume watched all this from the observation station buried within one of the Andean peaks that towered above Teihana&#8217;s village.
&#8220;Drop your fields now,&#8221; Ume said. &#8220;This is my last warning.&#8221;
&#8220;Warn away,&#8221; Cradle said. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing I can do about it.&#8221;
&#8220;Then you&#8217;ve left me no choice.&#8221;
Cradle was embarrassed to engage in this banter with three other visitors in the observation station, but they seemed to enjoy the drama. The tourists pointed and whispered as Ume departed. He ran down the long tunnel that led to the landing pad, where he climbed into his skyskiff and pointed the vehicle toward the valley.
Cradle watched Ume&#8217;s fit from a thousand different eyes scattered around the valley. The young posthuman&#8217;s persistence never ceased to amaze him. He tried to shout a final warning:
&#8220;I can&#8217;t let you -&#8221;
And that[...]</ns2:summary>

about the author&#8230;
Chris Lawson is a doctor and writer living in Australia. His short fiction has&#160;appeared in Asimov&#8217;s SF, Realms of Fantasy, Eidolon, and Dreaming Down-Under.&#160;In late October he blogged at www.talkingsquid.net about his process of creating&#160;a short story, but those posts concerned a different story. For this one, you won&#8217;t&#160;find any glimpses of the wizard behind the curtain &#8212; you&#8217;ll just have to enjoy it&#160;on its own terms.
about the narrator&#8230;
Last read for us on EP424; Bill started voice acting on the Metamor City Podcast, and has wanted to do more ever since. He spends his days working at a library, where he is in charge of all things with plugs and troubleshooting the people who use them. He spends his nights with his wife, two active children, and two overly active canines and all that goes with that.

from the author&#8217;s website&#8230; I&#8217;m a graduate of the University of Chicago, a lapsed PhD candidate at NYU (where I studied racial bias in police shoot/don&#8217;t shoot decisions), and an instructor at the&#160;Alpha Workshop for Young Writers.
I write science fiction and fantasy. My work has appeared or will soon appear in&#160;Clarkesworld, Analog,&#160;Strange&#160;Horizons,&#160;Lightspeed,&#160;and&#160;Beneath Ceaseless Skies,&#160;as well as winning&#160;the&#160;2011 Dell Award.&#160;I care about gender, subtext, prose style, the fallacies of human cognition, and the ramifications of all we&#8217;ve learned regarding causality, cosmology, and thought.
In my younger days I was a designer and writer on the&#160;Blue Planet&#160;(warning: video link) project for FreeSpace Open.

KUMARA
By Seth Dickinson

You asked me why you are alive, and this is the answer: because I was asked to do the impossible, to choose someone to die. And I loved them all, loved them as I loved Kumara, as I loved myself. I could not bear the choice.
&#8220;I need you to choose one of our crew to delete,&#8221; Kumara told me.
&#8220;I need room to think, or we&#8217;re not going to make it.&#8221;
Thirty years of diligence said no, never and I began to refuse.
Outside the ship a revenant screamed a radio scream and through the umbilical of our link I felt Kumara cry back in defiance: jamming but still overmatched, struggling against sixty million years of mindless machine hate. Throwing every spark of thought she could muster into beating the revenant&#8217;s virals, decrypting them, compiling an inoculation.
I closed my eyes and waited for her to fail, for the revenant to slip into her systems, for the antimatter torch to let go and end us all. But Kumara held herself together. Turned the attack.
Her avatar grinned up from where she knelt, shoulder bowed with effort, nails clawed down to pink flesh. &#8220;Saved us again,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Ha. And they told me I wasn&#8217;t built for this. Thirty years, and still state of the art!&#8221;
&#8220;You can make it,&#8221; I said, knowing it was a lie, that she had tapped every scrap of processing power in her hull. I was systems officer; I was the ship as much as she was. But still I begged: &#8220;Just an hour to the jump point. You&#8217;ll make it. You don&#8217;t need to ask for any more.&#8221;
Kumara had taken the image of a woman, cable-shouldered, strong. Her hands trembled and her eyes shone bright with an inhuman intellect, a very human fatigue. Her intellect was digital, her fatigue an abstract, but she wore the metaphor of flesh. Flesh speaks clearly to the human mind.
She looked up at me with those brilliant tired eyes and shook her head. &#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m out of processing power. They&#8217;re getting too sophisticated and I can&#8217;t keep up. You have to delete someone from heaven.&#8221;
I closed my eyes and turned away.
I was the last living crew of Kumara, you see? The others were dead: Captain Shiroma, who burned in her own armor as she stole the machine god&#8217;s dream, Matthews who cracked the revenant code, smiling Jayaraman who died first, wordless Landvatter whose ash still painted the hull.
Our raid on the machine god, our Promethean theft, had gone poorly.
But Kumara&#8217;s systems had saved them as they passed. Snared their dying minds, digitized them, and uploaded them to heaven: a simulation, a place that might keep them stable. Coddle them in a pleasant hallucination until their psyches could be retrieved.
The heaven mainframe was the only resource she hadn&#8217;t tapped. But to make it useful, room would have to be opened, load reallocated. And there w[...]</ns2:summary>

Author Robert Reed

about the author&#8230;
from the author&#8217;s website&#8230;
Bob has had eleven novels published, starting with&#160;The Leeshore&#160;in 1987 and most recently with&#160;The Memory of Sky&#160;in 2014. Since winning the first annual&#160;L. Ron Hubbard Writers of the Future&#160;contest in 1986 (under the pen name Robert Touzalin) and being a finalist for the John W. Campbell Award for best new writer in 1987, he has had over 180 shorter works published in a variety of magazines and anthologies. Eleven of those stories were published in his critically-acclaimed first collection,&#160;The Dragons of Springplace, in 1999. Twelve more stories appear in his second collection,&#160;The Cuckoo&#8217;s Boys&#160;[2005]. In addition to his success in the U.S., Reed has also been published in the U.K., Russia, Japan, Spain and in France, where a second (French-language) collection of nine of his shorter works,&#160;Chrysalide, was released in 2002. Bob has had stories appear in&#160;at leastone of the annual&#160;&#8220;Year&#8217;s Best&#8221;&#160;anthologies in every year since 1992. Bob has received nominations for both the&#160;Nebula Award&#160;(nominated and voted upon by genre authors) and the&#160;Hugo Award&#160;(nominated and voted upon by fans), as well as numerous other literary awards (see&#160;Awards). In 2007, he won his first Hugo Award for the 2006 novella&#160;&#8220;A Billion Eves&#8221;.
Reed continues to live in&#160;Lincoln, Nebraska, with his wife, Leslie, and daughter, Jessie. Local residents who may not know him for his award-nominated work as a genre writer may instead recognize him as an ardent long-distance runner &#8212; he can frequently be seen jogging through the parks and hiking trails of Lincoln, and has taken part in many of the area&#8217;s running races for the past several years.

Eater-of-bone
by Robert Reed
1
With cured gut and twitch-cord, the Nots had constructed their trap&#8212;a marriage of old cleverness and deep rage designed to catch dreaded, unworldly monsters such as her. But the device had lain undisturbed since summer, and the winter rains had washed away some of the leaf litter and clay that served as its camouflage. Knowing what to expect, the young woman easily spotted the taut lines and anchor points, and experience told her where a single soft footfall would trigger the mechanism, causing the ground to fall away. An extraordinarily deep hole had been dug into the hillside. One misstep, and she would plunge into blackness, every kick and helpless flail bringing down the loose dirt that would suffocate and then temporarily kill. She had seen this design before. The Nots were masters when it came to doing the same ancient tricks again and again. Only once in her experience had this type of mechanism worked as designed, but the vivid memory of that exceptionally miserable night was enough to make the woman step backwards&#8212;a reflexive, foolish reaction, since traps occasionally came in pairs, and one careless motion could be more dangerous than twenty smart, studied footfalls.
But her bare foot fortunately hit only damp dirt, and she felt nothing worse than a jikk-incisor gouging her exposed Achilles.
She knelt slowly and pulled the thorn free, placing a thumb across the wound to force the first drop of blood to remain inside her body. Her skin grew warm beneath her touch, and then there was no wound. Sucking on her thumb, she tasted iron and salt and a dozen flavors of grime, and after some consideration, she carefully, carefully traced out a wide ellipse that eventually placed the trap upwind from her.
Riding the breeze was the arom[...]</ns2:summary>

This Is As I Wish To Be Restored
by Christie Yant

Every night I come home and I drink. I trade away the hope, the guilt, the fear, even the love&#8211;I think it&#8217;s love, crazy as it seems. I trade them for oblivion, because otherwise I won&#8217;t sleep at all. I drink until there&#8217;s no life left in me, until I&#8217;m able to forget for just a little while the chrome vessel in the corner and what&#8217;s at stake. Sometimes I hope that I&#8217;ll dream of her. Sometimes I&#8217;m afraid that I will.

I have two things that belonged to her. The first is a photograph, taken at a party in what looks like a hotel. Her hair is dyed red&#8212;it doesn&#8217;t quite suit her, so you know it isn&#8217;t hers, like an unexpected note in a melody where you thought you knew where it was going and then it went sharp. She&#8217;s holding a glass of something pink and bubbly. Maybe it&#8217;s her birthday. If so, it&#8217;s probably her twenty-eighth. She&#8217;s laughing.

She was really young to be a client. Especially back then, most of the people who thought about life extension were retirees. Mortality was very much on their minds, and they&#8217;d had a lifetime to accumulate their savings&#8212;suspension was expensive. I wonder where she got the money. Her file doesn&#8217;t say.

So in this picture she&#8217;s laughing. She&#8217;s seated, supporting herself with one hand braced against the carpeted floor. Her head is thrown back and her back is arched, and she&#8217;s just the most beautiful thing I&#8217;ve ever seen. There are other people around her, behind her, just smiling blurs holding drinks, but you get the feeling that she&#8217;s the reason they&#8217;re smiling. She&#8217;s the star they&#8217;re all in orbit around. Like me. I fell into her orbit years ago and can&#8217;t break free.

The picture moves with me through my bleak basement apartment, from room to room&#8212;sometimes it turns up on top of the half-size refrigerator, sometimes absent-mindedly left on a shelf in the medicine cabinet where I discover it again later and take it with me to the bedroom. I&#8217;ve found it between the sofa cushions at least half a dozen times. She follows me, or I follow her&#8212;it&#8217;s been a lifetime since she smiled that smile, and I&#8217;m still completely, utterly taken.

The one place it never goes is on the dewar in the corner. &#160;That would just be too macabre, considering.

This is the only photograph she left. I often wonder what it was about this moment, this time in her life, that she could have looked ahead and known that this was as good as it gets. In this picture the cancer&#8217;s already killing her, she just doesn&#8217;t know it.

She died less than a year later. Pancreatic cancer. It&#8217;s in her file.

Those Are Pearls That Were His Eyes by Daniel Marcus
The only window in Suki&#8217;s bedroom opened onto an airshaft that ran through the center of the building like the path of a bullet. &#160;She would lie in bed in the hot summer nights with the salt smell of the drying seabed coming in through the open window, a sheen of sweat filming her forehead and plastering the sheets to her body like tissue, listening to her downstairs neighbors. &#160;When they made love, their cries echoing up through the airshaft made her loins ache, and she brought release to herself silently, visualizing men with slender, oiled limbs and faces hidden in shadow. Sometimes the neighbors sang, odd, sinuous music redolent with quarter tones. &#160;The melodies wove counterpoint like a tapestry of smoke and for some reason Suki thought of mountains. &#160;Jagged, fractal peaks thrusting out of an evergreen carpet. &#160;Summits brushed with snow. &#160;Tongues of cloud laying across the low passes. Sometimes they argued, and the first time she heard the man&#8217;s deep voice raised in anger she was sure he was a Beast, possibly an Ursa. She was less certain of the woman, but there was a sibilant, lilting quality to her voice that suggested something of the feline. &#160;They&#8217;d moved in three weeks before but their sleep cycles seemed out of sync with hers and she still hadn&#8217;t met them. Suki tried to imagine herself going downstairs to borrow something &#8212; sugar, yarn, a databead. &#160;His broad muzzle would poke out from behind the half-closed door; his liquid b[...]</ns2:summary>

about the author&#8230;
from writertopia&#8230; A firm believer in the &#8220;apply butt to chair, then fingers to keyboard&#8221; philosophy, Ferrett Steinmetz writes for at least an hour every day &#8211; which helps, he promises. He is a graduate of both the&#160;Clarion Writers&#8217; Workshop&#160;and Viable Paradise, and has been nominated for the Nebula Award, for which he remains stoked.
Ferrett has a moderately popular blog,&#160;The Watchtower of Destruction, wherein he talks about bad puns, relationships, politics, videogames, and more bad puns. He is the creator of the most popular and comprehensive&#160;online purity quizzes&#160;(this one&#8217;s for sex, but he&#8217;s also done them for&#160;roleplaying&#160;and&#160;Livejournal). He&#8217;s written four computer books, including the still-popular-after-two-years&#160;Wicked Cool PHP.
He lives in Cleveland with his wife, who he couldn&#8217;t imagine living without.

about the narrator&#8230;
Amy&#8217;s voice over training began by taking a short workshop at the Alliance Theatre, instructed by industry veteran, Paul Armbruster. &#160;Having whetted her appetite for the craft, she sought out further voiceover training with experts and agents alike, and finally landed at yourAct studios in Atlanta, GA. Under the expert instruction of Della Cole, a seasoned voice actress with over 30 years experience as both an actress and an agent, Amy grew as an actress and a voice over talent. She continues to sharpen her skills and is constantly working hard to provide the best possible voiceovers in the business. She is now proudly represented by&#160;People Store, and Umberger Agency, and works both in local studios and out of her home studio.

Black Swan Oracle
by Ferrett Steinmetz
The crowd waiting below The Oracle&#8217;s bulletproof bay window is a mathematically predictable entity. Still, the Oracle relishes any illusion of chaos &#8211; and so, every morning, just before she allows herself one single prayer, she sweeps open her curtains to gaze over the crowd.
Her supplicants look up from their shivered huddling as fluorescent light spills out from The Oracle&#8217;s bay window; poor women in smudged hoodies squat next to Armani-clad stockbrokers. The Oracle&#8217;s hundreds of supplicants put up tents faster than the policemen can tear them down, burn garbage to ward off the Seine&#8217;s chill winds, buy gristled chicken hunks from illegal street vendors. The wait can take weeks, so long that people fall in love and fuck and have violently dramatic breakups before The Oracle&#8217;s guards fish these poor souls from the crowd to escort them towards an answer made pure with data.
The Oracle&#8217;s tide of supplicants is so constant that, like any shantytown, it has developed its own economy&#8230; an economy which pulses perfectly in time with the rhythms The Oracle predicted. She&#8217;d spent hours developing algorithms to anticipate the crowd you would get if you charged $25,000 for a single question, answers guaranteed (but not to please), in this geographic and demographic cluster. She&#8217;d analyzed the local politicians, and the bribes she pays remain within .03% of initial estimates. She&#8217;d tracked the movements of the most influential reporters, ascertaining they would pass by here 2.4 times a week, guaranteeing unending press for &#8220;The Statistic Mystic,&#8221; a name the Oracle loathes. She even predicted the number of e. coli outbreaks from undercooked chicken.
Yet every morning, before The Oracle orders her guards to escort the first supplicant in, The Oracle kneels. She above all people knows how irrational prayers are &#8212; multigenerational analyses of billions of lives has allowed The Oracle to thoroughly disprove the effects of prayers, bioharmonics, Zener cards, craniometry, reiki, [...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;When Joss Whedon writes something, you generally expect it to have great dialogue and characterization, some stuff that will make you uncomfortable, and an ending that, while not necessarily happy or good, will be satisfying. The new film &lt;i&gt;In Your Eyes&lt;/i&gt; has two of those, at least.&lt;/p&gt;

Author Derek Kunsken

about the author&#8230;
I&#8217;m a writer of science fiction, fantasy, &#160;and sometimes accidentally, horror. I write and read both novel-length and short fiction, with a preference for works that explore really strange places and people.

THE WAY OF THE NEEDLE
Derek K&#252;nsken
I
The ancient pulsar&#8217;s lighthouse beam of microwaves and radio waves spun twice per second. Within the bloom of its magnetic field orbited the single planet that had survived the long-ago supernova, at the cost of its crust and mantle. An atmosphere of carbon dioxide had congealed around the little metallic world, producing oceans of iron and nickel carbonyl, dotted with thickets of steel needles that fanned to catch the microwaves. On the largest islands, the growth of the needles had been coaxed into towers, pedestals, and martial walls. Prickly metal creatures held together by strong magnetic fields scuttled in these towns and forts, on eight articulated legs of steel spines. Their fine quills caught the flashing microwaves, generating the electricity for their quick, agile movements.
One of them, whose fame would not be made for many years yet, was uncomfortable in a disguise. Mok was a Follower of the Needle, an order of martial priests. Whereas other Followers and fighters-at-arms bore large metal claws high on their forelegs, Mok now scurried with only small, shameful servant claws. No one recognized him and no one complimented him. Nor would he earn any compliments from this mission; he&#8217;d been sent by Master Hac not as a warrior to fight under the full shine of the pulsar, but as an assassin.
Mok tried to fan his steel quills wider, but the road was too crowded. Fussing builders swung long rods culled from faraway orchards, patching the palisaded walls that lined the streets. Shabby, short-needled monks stood where the upturned points of the streets were overlaid with rusted garbage and sniped at each other with pinching claws and philosophical recriminations. Mok paused at a stall where a thinly needled elder showed off processed snow paste.
Mok hadn&#8217;t stopped for the snow paste. He wasn&#8217;t hungry. He&#8217;d stopped for the view of the Ban estate. The Ban family had consolidated an immense estate on the south road during the clan wars. Its high noble gate showed sprouting buildings and growing towers within the palisade. Slow mercenaries controlled the gate. To the side, at a narrow opening, flowed the swarmers, servants and merchants, short-needled and small-clawed.
Mok was a noble. Anyone with fighting claws was, but his great claws were now preserved on Master Hac&#8217;s estate, while he pretended to be less than he was to reach his target. He needed an excuse to enter. He crossed to a rod merchant. He took a pair of rods and scraped a payment of snow paste from his under-needles. He hefted these and scrambled to the swarmer entrance, like anyone else looking to repair a wall. Ahead of him, each of the entrants tipped the door ward, a clawless swarmer with powdery spines. Mok hesitated. He&#8217;d promised to play the swarmer to enter the estate, but had not considered that he&#8217;d need to tip one. Tips flowed toward honor. What did it say about him if he tipped a swarmer?
&#8220;Hello, friend,&#8221; the door ward said. Mok was the finest of the Followers of the Needle. He could not bring himself to reply. &#8220;Are you well, friend?&#8221; the door ward asked. His magnetic field was flabby, with distortions around the joints. Snow paste hung in clots, trembling as if ready to drop. Mok scraped the thinnest gratuity from one of his under-needles and slapped it onto the swarmer&#8217;s outstretched claw. He hurried through the entrance,[...]</ns2:summary>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;When I was offered the opportunity to review &lt;i&gt;Ghosts of Engines Past&lt;/i&gt;, a short-story collection by Sean McMullen, the initial e-mail said it was a steampunk anthology. I suppose this is broadly true, in much the same way that an anthology about veterinarians might be 80 percent dog stories. In this case, the 80 percent is stories of flight. And if there's one thing McMullen knows how to do, it's make people fly.&lt;/p&gt;

author Pat Murphy

about the author&#8230;
I&#8217;m a writer, a scientist, and sometimes a toy maker.
All of my stories and novels have a hint of the strange. Some have been called science fiction, some fantasy, and some neither one. Most of my work falls between categories. I think that the most interesting events happen at the edges, in the borderlands where the lines are fuzzy.
My fiction writing has won a number of&#160;awards, including the Nebula Award for Science Fiction, the World Fantasy Award, the Philip K. Dick Award for best paperback original, the Christopher Award, and the Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award. I also co-founded the&#160;James Tiptree Memorial Award.
When I&#8217;m not writing fiction, I write books about science. For upwards of 20 years, I was a writer at the Exploratorium, San Francisco&#8217;s hands-on museum of science, art, and human perception. These days, I write science books for&#160;Klutz, a publisher of how-to books that come packaged with the tools of their trade (from juggling cubes to foldable paper dragons that fly). &#160;This is where I get a chance to try my hand at toy making. Working with at team at Klutz, I help develop the stuff that goes with the books&#160;&#8212; from origami starfighters to a snap-together skeletal hand.
Sometimes, I also teach writing. I&#8217;ve taught in Stanford University&#8217;s Creative Writing Program, at the University of California at Santa Cruz, and at the Clarion Speculative Fiction Workshops in Michigan and Seattle.

Paprika
by Jason Sanford
&#8220;Ah Paprika, you dance so well,&#8221; Satoshi exclaimed each bright-sun morning, his praise always pleasing no matter how many times Paprika heard it. And Paprika could dance, she really could. Not like some of the olds, who&#8217;d spent millennia shaping their locked-down bodies through graceful movements. But still she could dance. Ballet. The Twist. The Bhangra.
Sometimes she&#8217;d make herself as tiny as Satoshi&#8217;s hand and pirouette for hours on his workbench while he reformed nano into exciting, long-lost toys. Other times she&#8217;d dance full sized&#8211;child sized as Satoshi would say, although Paprika knew to never speak that depressing word to customers. Paprika would create a full-flowing lehengas skirt&#8211;always the brightest of greens&#8211;and she&#8217;d dance in the store window, spinning and spinning until she was so overcome with happiness she&#8217;d dance through the window into the outside world, leaping and spinning to imaginary partners, bowing and smiling to the boys and girls who never came, flying across the deserted streets and passing in and out of the empty but perfectly preserved buildings surrounding Satoshi&#8217;s shop.
But whenever any of the few olds left in the city visited, Paprika restr[...]</ns2:summary>

about the author&#8230;
Holly Heisey launched her writing career in sixth grade when she wrote her class play, a medieval fantasy. It was love at first dragon. Since then, she&#8217;s been a finalist in the Writers of the Future Contest, and her short fiction has appeared in&#160;Aoife&#8217;s Kiss&#160;and&#160;Avenir Eclectia Volume 1. Holly also designs and illustrates, and her illustrations have appeared in works from award-winning Port Yonder Press and Splashdown Books. When she&#8217;s not writing or drawing, Holly can often be found strumming, bowing, or hammering away on her bevy of stringed instruments. Holly lives in Arizona with Larry and Moe, her two pet cacti, and she is currently at work on a science fantasy epic.
about the narrator&#8230;
Wilson Fowlie has been getting more and more into voice work ever since 2008, when he read his first story for Podcastle. He recently lost his full-time job, so he&#8217;s actively looking for paid voice work. If you like the way Wilson tells a story, snap him up quick! And if you&#8217;re in the Vancouver, Canada area &#8211; or even if you just love a good show chorus &#8211; check out The Maple Leaf Singers, the group he directs. You can find them at their own website or their Facebook page. www.mapleleafsingers.com

An Understanding
by Holly Heisey
The sun on Joppa was a deeper red than I remembered, and the blocky shapes of this dusty town I did not remember at all. I passed the sign for Hann River Landing and walked down the main street. There were few people about, mostly women and young children, the mothers dressed in plain cotton and linen and the children ratty, if not mostly clean. The women watched me with a glare reserved for strangers that they must not have used for some time. There were no aircars, no groundcars, no visible signs of industry. Trees around the houses boxed them in at odd angles, some branches bending to stop abruptly in the air. The Time Walls were tight here.
I checked the bridge tethering me to Aijas Normal time on my ship in orbit, and checked my rate of sync with local time. It was a strain, to be held in two times at once. I would not stay here long.
I scanned into the minds around me, looking for that one particular voice I&#8217;d caught two hundred and twelve lightyears out on a wave of Kaireyeh. A young woman. I felt her here, the barest scent of her, and turned down 2nd Street and then onto Acada Lane. The houses on Acada Lane were spaced twenty and thirty feet apart, no more than thirty or forty feet wide, with trimmed lawns of brown grass. Children played in a yard down the street. It was all so quiet that if I turned off the voices for a moment I could hear the rhythm of the Time Walls around me. Beats barely forming measure. I quickened my pace.
Her house was one-story with peeling blue paint and white plastic trim. I climbed up the three steps to the creaking porch and since there was no button for a caller rapped my knuckles on the door.
I waited. I searched for her mind again&#8211;yes she was here. I rapped again. I rubbed a small circle of dust off the door window and peered inside. I did what I had not wanted to do but was necessary now and touched her mind. She gave an inner start and I withdrew quickly, leaving behind only the thought that she must open the door; I was a friend.
The door rattled and jerked inward. A slim, red-haired woman looked back at me with almond eyes. Her skin was a dusky tan, typical for Joppan natives. She looked up at my ice-white face, a face that would never be typical in any situation, and I remembered my eyes to blink. I saw and felt her shudder.
&#8220;Lorin, may I come in?&#8221; I said.
Her eyes narrowed. &#8220;What do you want? I don&#8217;t have more to give, [...]</ns2:summary>

Valedictorian
by N. K. Jemisin
There are three things Zinhle decides, when she is old enough to understand. The first is that she will never, ever, give less than her best to anything she tries to do. The second is that she will not live in fear. The third, which is perhaps meaningless given the first two and yet comes to define her existence most powerfully, is this: she will be herself. No matter what.
For however brief a time.
#
&#8220;Have you considered getting pregnant?&#8221; her mother blurts one morning, over breakfast.
Zinhle&#8217;s father drops his fork, though he recovers and picks it up again quickly. This is how Zinhle knows that what her mother has said is not a spontaneous burst of insanity. They have discussed the matter, her parents. They are in agreement. Her father was just caught off-guard by the timing.
But Zinhle, too, has considered the matter in depth. Do they really think she wouldn&#8217;t have? &#8220;No,&#8221; she says.
Zinhle&#8217;s mother is stubborn. This is where Zinhle herself gets the trait. &#8220;The Sandersens&#8217; boy &#8212; you used to play with him, when you were little, remember? &#8212; he&#8217;s decent. Discreet. He got three girls pregnant last year, and doesn&#8217;t charge much. The babies aren&#8217;t bad-looking. And we&#8217;d help you with the raising, of course.&#8221; She hesitates, then adds with obvious discomfort, &#8220;A friend of mine at work &#8212; Charlotte, you&#8217;ve met her &#8212; she says he&#8217;s, ah, he&#8217;s not rough or anything, doesn&#8217;t try to hurt girls &#8212; &#8221;
&#8220;No,&#8221; Zinhle says again, more firmly. She does not raise her voice. Her parents raised her to be respectful of her elders. She believes respect includes being very, very clear about some things.
Zinhle&#8217;s mother looks at her father, seeking an ally. Her father is a gentle, soft-spoken man in a family of strong-willed women. Stupid people think he is weak; he isn&#8217;t. He just knows when a battle isn&#8217;t worth fighting. So he looks at Zinhle now, and after a moment he shakes his head. &#8220;Let it go,[...]</ns2:summary>

The Aliens Made of Glass
by Helena Bell
Sister Charles Regina, formerly of the Daughters of Perpetual Help, attends to her boat, the Nunc Dimittis, as if it were the sole member of her parish. She scrubs the white transom, the gunwale, the wooden steps leading to the bridge, and the metal railings. She vacuums the carpet in the salon, empties then refills the refrigerator and checks the interior cabinets for ants. Once a week she cleans the bottom of the hull and even in this she is practiced and ritualed, reciting a dozen rosaries in time with the digs of her paint scraper, the bodies of barnacles swirling around her like ash. It gives her peace. Each action and inaction she commits will lead to consequences and she revels in the knowledge that everything worn away will be built up again. In these moments she does not miss the convent or her religion or God. She does not mind that the aliens are coming.
Sister Charles Regina, n&#233;e Kathleen, brings the dock-master filets of tuna, wahoo, mahi mahi and sheepshead. For this and her company, Gray gives her electricity, use of the slip, and help with the lines. They watch the evening news together, and Gray does not ask about her lack of prayer over the meal. Kathleen does not ask after his parents or sister. He is her family; she is his. It is enough.
&#8220;The aliens passed Neptune today,&#8221; the local weather girl says, but she has been announcing the passing of Neptune for several days. A countdown glows in the right-hand corner with flickering dates and estimations. They will be here in 467 days, three years, or seven years, decades, soon, soon, sooner than we are ready.
The aliens move as slowly and perpetually as shadows on a sundial. The anchors express disbelief that we spotted them near Pluto at all. Should not they have zipped in at the speed of light? At warp? Hyperspace? Should not they be in our skies one minute, the valleys of the moon the next? Kathleen wonders if space is more like the ocean than anyone thought with currents and tides and troughs. She pictures the aliens adjusting a compass set to the pull of opposing suns. She imagines long, bone white fingers turning the knobs of a LORAN adjusted for eleven-dimensional space.
Instead of sports, a man in a checkered suit announces the decision of all space-faring nations to reroute their shuttles, their satellites, and refitted weather balloons. Like marathon racers or a soapbox derby, the line of them stretches from Baikonour to the moon. A tech company has announced a prize for the first privately-funded spaceship to reach the aliens. A second prize for the first to establish meaningful contact[...]</ns2:summary>

about the narrator&#8230;
M.K. Hobson recently decided to follow a time-honored authorial tradition and become a bitter recluse. She swore off all social media and left her website to go to seed. At the moment, she exists only as a voice on short fiction podcasts such asPodcastle&#160;and&#160;Cast of Wonders.&#160;She leavens the tedium of her vastly expanded free time with misanthropy, paranoia, and weight lifting.

Repo
by Aaron Gallagher
It took concentration to perform delicate work in the cumbersome gloves of the suit. The rounded fingers were metal-tipped, and bulky. Elise painted the tips of her gloves with luminous paint for ease when working outside.
The octopus found the wires and shorted the alarm. The device glowed green and she triggered the manual release. The door popped, expelling a breath or two of oxygen.
Elise slipped into the airlock and closed it behind her, shutting the door on the endless black of space. The inside porthole looked into the cargo hold. She glided through the cargo room with three kicks.
The head-up on her helmet showed schematics in blue. She found the environmental control room.
She flipped open the airtight seal on a container holding a large slab of green gel. She snapped open a metal vial sprayed dark liquid onto the slab. She sealed the container, turned the machinery to full, and crouched by the door out of sight.
At thirty minutes, Elise headed upstairs for the cockpit. Empty. She looked for the captain&#8217;s cabin. In the cabin&#8217;s refresher, she found his body slumped in a large rubber bag.
Great. He passed out in the shower.
Elise wrestled the naked man out of the rubber shower. Round globules of water drifted around them. She pulled a sedative pad out of her bag and slapped it onto Holland&#8217;s arm. The chemicals seeped into his bloodstream.
He&#8217;d sleep twenty-four hours in a chemical coma. She left him in his bunk pouch, cinch closed around his neck. His balding head bobbed in the breeze from the vent.
Back in the environmental control room, she worked the o2 scrubbers at full blast for thirty minutes. She broke seal on her helmet and sniffed the air, ready to clamp the helmet down the moment she felt dizzy.
Clean.
The ship was hers.
Elise floated through the ship to familiarize herself. It didn&#8217;t take long. It was a small Beech Skimmer, cargo capacity of around five metric tons. The craft was cylindrical, with two floors. Cargo, environmental, and engine room below. Main floor above was one long corridor, sixty meters long, with the cockpit at the fore, two staterooms to each side, a combination kitchen, dining room, and recreation area at the other end. The ship was roomy for one, comfortable with eight, rated for a maximum of sixteen.
Down below she examined the engines, because no pilot she knew ran a ship within recommended specs. The big Beech was tuned up to 122% efficiency. She studied the specs to learn what he had done. She shook her head. Sure, he&#8217;d managed to coax more power from the big engine, but it would need an overhaul twice as often. She shut off the display with a shrug. They never thought of the bottom line.
She finished her inspection and sealed her helmet. As she kicked out of the airlock, she paused to admire the view. It was worth admiring. Pluto, with her single, sickly colony. The dock in orbit, half-full of ships in port, lit like Vegas, and shining like diamonds on velvet.
She slipped under Adage to where her Betty was Remora&#8217;d to the hull and went inside. She plopped into the pilot&#8217;s couch. All her controls were custom, larger than normal. She spent a lot of time in her suit. Only two hours had passed since she used thrusters to come alongside the bigger ship. She watched the displays as she worked the controls[...]</ns2:summary>

about the author&#8230;

author Clifford Simak

(source:&#160;wikipedia) &#8220;Clifford Donald Simak&#160;(August 3, 1904 &#8211; April 25, 1988) was an&#160;American&#160;science fiction&#160;writer. He was honored by fans with three&#160;Hugo Awards&#160;and by colleagues with one&#160;Nebula Award. The&#160;Science Fiction Writers of America&#160;made him its third&#160;SFWA Grand Master and the&#160;Horror Writers Association&#160;made him one of three inaugural winners of the&#160;Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement.
Simak was born in&#160;Millville,&#160;Wisconsin&#160;in 1904, son of John Lewis and Margaret (Wiseman) Simak. He married Agnes Kuchenberg on April 13, 1929 and they had two children, Richard (Dick) Scott (d. 2012) and Shelley Ellen. Simak attended the&#160;University of Wisconsin&#8211;Madison&#160;and later worked at various newspapers in the&#160;Midwest. He began a lifelong association with the&#160;Minneapolis Star and Tribune&#160;(inMinneapolis,&#160;Minnesota) in 1939, which continued until his retirement in 1976. He became&#160;Minneapolis Star&#8217;s news editor in 1949 and coordinator of&#160;Minneapolis Tribune&#8217;s&#160;Science Reading Series&#160;in 1961. In a blurb in&#160;Time and Again&#160;he wrote, &#8220;I have been happily married to the same woman for thirty three years and have two children. My favorite recreation is fishing (the lazy way, lying in a boat and letting them come to me). Hobbies: Chess, stamp collecting, growing roses.&#8221; He dedicated the book to his wife Kay, &#8220;without whom I&#8217;d never have written a line&#8221;. He was well liked by many of his science fiction cohorts, especially&#160;Isaac Asimov. He died in Minneapolis in 1988.
Simak became interested in science fiction after reading the works of&#160;H. G. Wells&#160;as a child. His first contribution to the literature was &#8220;The World of the Red Sun&#8221;, published by&#160;Hugo Gernsback&#160;in the December 1931 issue of&#160;Wonder Stories&#160;with one opening illustration by&#160;Frank R. Paul. Within a year he placed three more stories in Gernsback&#8217;s&#160;pulp magazines&#160;and one in&#160;Astounding Stories, then edited by Harry Bates. But his only science fiction publication between 1932 and 1938 was&#160;The Creator&#160;(Marvel Tales&#160;#4, March&#8211;April 1935), a notable story with religious implications, which was then rare in the genre.
Once&#160;John W. Campbell, at the helm of&#160;Astounding&#160;from October 1937, began redefining the field, Simak returned and was a regular contributor to&#160;Astounding Science Fiction&#160;(as it was renamed in 1938) throughout the&#160;Golden Age of Science Fiction&#160;(1938&#8211;1950). At first, as in the 1939 serial novel&#160;Cosmic Engineers, he wrote in the tradition of the earlier &#8220;superscience&#8221; subgenre that&#160;E. E. &#8220;Doc&#8221; Smith&#160;perfected, but he soon developed his own style, which is usually described as gentle and&#160;pastoral. During this period, Simak also published a number of war and western stories in pulp magazines. His best-known novel may be&#160;City, a collection of short stories with a common theme of mankind&#8217;s eventual exodus from Earth.
Simak continued to produce award-nominated novels throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Aided by a friend, he continued writing and publishing science fiction and, later, fantasy, into his 80s. He believed that science fiction not rooted in scientific fact was responsible for the failure of the genre to be taken seriously, and stated his aim was to make the genre a part of what he called &#8220;realistic fiction.&#8221;

Stop Me if You&#8217;ve Heard This One
by KC Ball
Lori Meeker pushed her hair out of her eyes and leaned back against the sink. She squeezed the cold porcelain edge to still her trembling hands and focused on the pair of plainclothes cops shoehorned into the women&#8217;s can with her.
The space was hardly bigger than a closet but the restrooms were the only private spaces in the bar, and the detectives had insisted on questioning her alone.
&#8220;The restrooms always this clean?&#8221; Detective Gayle asked.
&#8220;Yeah. Augie&#8217;s bat-shit crazy about dirt and germs.&#8221;
Gayle raised an eyebrow. &#8220;Bat-shit crazy, huh? Is that your professional opinion?&#8221;
&#8220;Pardon my French,&#8221; Lori snapped.
Lori had met women just like Gayle. Always judging, always pretending they could do anything a man could do. Always looking down their perfect nose at girls who had to work in joints like Augie&#8217;s Bar &amp; Grill.
And Augie was bat-shit crazy about germs. A damned phobia, that&#8217;s what she should have said. It was a bar, for god&#8217;s sake, not some fancy restaurant. The place was cleaner than it had any need to be.
&#8220;Tell us what you saw and heard,&#8221; Detective Osbourne said.
Osbourne looked like a nice man, the kind of guy who would listen without judging. Lori decided to talk to him. She weighed how much to tell him, though. She was afraid he might call her crazy, might laugh and stop listening to her, if she said she didn&#8217;t think the dead body out on the bar floor was human.
Lori fished her cigarettes from her sweater pocket, shook a fresh one from the pack and sparked it with her butane lighter. Gayle turned her head away and coughed. Lori smiled.
&#8220;You going to talk to us?&#8221; Gayle asked.
Lori blew more smoke toward Gayle and focused on Osbourne&#8217;s big, brown hound-dog eyes.
&#8220;I unlocked the door at eleven,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Right off, this little guy strolled in, just like he owned the place. Augie gave him the once over, went back to stocking the cooler with a case of Red Hook.&#8221;
&#8220;What did you make of him?&#8221; Osbourne asked.
&#8220;I saw right off that he was slumming. I can tell the type. But A[...]</ns2:summary>

about the author&#8230;
(from Wikipedia) Robert Sheckley was born in Brooklyn, New York. In 1931 the family moved to Maplewood, New Jersey. Sheckley attended Columbia High School, where he discovered science fiction. He graduated in 1946 and hitchhiked to California the same year, where he tried numerous jobs: landscape gardener, pretzel salesman, barman, milkman, warehouseman, and general laborer &#8220;board man&#8221; in a hand-painted necktie studio. Finally, still in 1946, he joined the U.S. Army and was sent to Korea. During his time in the army he served as a guard, an army newspaper editor, a payroll clerk, and guitarist in an army band. He left the service in 1948.
Sheckley then attended New York University, where he received an undergraduate degree in 1951. The same year he married for the first time, to Barbara Scadron. The couple had one son, Jason. Sheckley worked in an aircraft factory and as an assistant metallurgist for a short time, but his breakthrough came quickly: in late 1951 he sold his first story, Final Examination, to Imagination magazine. He quickly gained prominence as a writer, publishing stories in Imagination, Galaxy, and other science fiction magazines. The 1950s saw the publication of Sheckley&#8217;s first four books: short story collections Untouched by Human Hands (Ballantine, 1954), Citizen in Space (1955), and Pilgrimage to Earth (Bantam, 1957), and a novel, Immortality, Inc. (first published as a serial in Galaxy, 1958).
Sheckley and Scadron divorced in 1956. The writer married journalist Ziva Kwitney in 1957. The newly married couple lived in Greenwich Village. Their daughter, Alisa Kwitney, born in 1964, would herself become a successful writer. Applauded by critic Kingsley Amis, Sheckley was now selling many of his deft, satiric stories to mainstream magazines such as Playboy. In addition to his science fiction stories, in 1960s Sheckley started writing suspense fiction. More short story collections and novels appeared in the 1960s, and a film adaptation of an early story by Sheckley, The 10th Victim, was released in 1965.
Sheckley spent much of 1970s living on Ibiza. He and Kwitney divorced in 1972 and the same year Sheckley married Abby Schulman, whom he had met in Ibiza. The couple had two children, Anya and Jed. The couple separated while living in London. In 1980, the writer returned to the United States and became fiction editor of the newly established OMNI magazine. Sheckley left OMNI in 1981 with his fourth wife, writer Jay Rothbell a.k.a. Jay Sheckley, and they subsequently traveled widely in Europe, finally ending up in Portland, Oregon, where they separated. He married Gail Dana of Portland in 1990. Sheckley continued publishing further science fiction and espionage/mystery stories, and collaborated with other writers such as Roger Zelazny and Harry Harrison.
During a 2005 visit to Ukraine for the Ukrainian Sci-Fi Computer Week, an international event for science fiction writers, Sheckley fell ill and had to be hospitalized in Kiev on April 27. His condition was very serious for one week, but he appeared to be slowly recovering. Sheckley&#8217;s official website ran a fundraising campaign to help cover Sheckley&#8217;s treatment and his return to the United States. Sheckley settled in Red Hook, in northern Dutchess County, New York, to be near his daughters Anya and Alisa. On November 20 he had surgery for a brain aneurysm; he died in a Poughkeepsie hospital on December 9, 2005.
