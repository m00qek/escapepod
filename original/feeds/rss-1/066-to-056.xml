<p><i>On one occasion&#8211;he flinched to remember it&#8211;the invaders had brought him Cthara eggs. Warm, fertilized eggs, likely ripped just that day from the hatching burrow of some poor herder family. It had been the greatest challenge the Creator had ever sent him. His fangs had unfolded without his conscious will, and only a lifetime of piety and self-control had kept him from sinking them into the small bodies of the terrified guards.</i></p>

<p><i>His venom had dripped onto the filthy floor, and after the guards left he had lain shuddering in the dampness, feeling the leathery eggs by his flank gradually cool and die. Over and over he repeated the litany of the Prophet: &#8220;People shall not sink fang into other speaking people. People shall not eat the flesh of other speaking people. People shall not make war&#8230;&#8221;</i></p>

<p><b>Rated PG</b>.  Contains slavery, heavy moral themes, and some violence.</p>

<p><i>&#8220;What&#8217;s left of him. Yes. All of that civilian nano would interfere with crucial signals sent and received by the nano in use by the MedTechs. Can&#8217;t risk it. That bomb was nasty. What I&#8217;m telling you is classified, obviously. We have no intention of presenting Arrington to the world as less than the man he deserves to be.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><b>Rated PG</b>.  Contains implications of violence, heavy politics, and split ends. </p>

Read and Produced by Wichita Rutherford (of 5 Minutes With Wichita).

“There’s a reason we don’t use nano to cut the President-Chairman’s hair. You know about the assassination attempt three years ago?”

Everyone did. “I thought he was fully recovered.”

“What’s left of him. Yes. All of that civilian nano would interfere with crucial signals sent and received by the nano in use by the MedTechs. Can’t risk it. That bomb was nasty. What I’m telling you is classified, obviously. We have no intention of presenting Arrington to the world as less than the man he deserves to be.”

Rated PG.  Contains implications of violence, heavy politics, and split ends.

paying to see something they&#8217;ve already seen, even if he is an alien.  I mean, it&#8217;s not like you do

Generally speaking, I need only three minutes of concentrated attention to kill someone by staring at them.  If I’m feeling under the weather, or my mind is preoccupied with other matters–you know how your mind can obsess about trivial things sometimes–it might take five minutes for my power to have its effect.  On the other hand, if I focus intensely on my victim I can get the job done in as little as ninety seconds.

…Now the nation is at war.  Or so we’re told.  I guess that changes everything.  A person like me becomes much more important.

Rated R.  Contains violence, some sexual content, and disturbing themes.

 After a decade of ceaseless writing struggle, Satan had come to him in – of all places – the soup aisle at Meijer’s grocery store. There was no fire and brimstone, no tail, no horns, not even that cool hipster pointy goatee the devil always sported in the movies. He was actually kind of fat, and wore a three-piece suit with Gucci shoes. He didn’t look at all like Satan — he looked more like Dom Delouise posing as a lawyer.

Rated R.  Contains profanity, violence, clowns, and violence against profane clowns.
