She had been wondering if she should start her own poetry business. She believed Milwaukee might need a poet for hire to spread the magic of verse around the town. Sometimes, in her current job as a medical secretary, she secretly wrote poems for especially ill patients. They got well, and Verity felt certain the focused mental energy from the poems helped them. She wanted to write poetry full-time to spread its energy to more people — to become the city’s first commercial free-lance poet.

<p><i>    Missy downshifted as she pulled into the median of the interstate to avoid the state troopers and the mess of traffic-snarled cars attempting to leave the coast too late.  I tried not to look at the panicked faces inside the cars, lit by the headlights of those behind them.  All waiting to escape the storm.  Just like us, but powerless to move &#8212; to phase, if needed &#8212; the way we did.  Sucking on the cigarette, I slid lower onto the wornout springs of the back seat.  Slowly I pulled my gaze away from those we were leaving behind.</i></p>

<p><i>    One thing I learned from Oklahoma: if I thought about the people too much, I&#8217;d be worthless.</i></p>

<p><b>Rated R</b>.  Contains graphic violent imagery, intense themes of natural and man-made disasters, and incidental profanity.  Not one of our lighter stories.</p>

Read by Steve Dupont.

    Missy downshifted as she pulled into the median of the interstate to avoid the state troopers and the mess of traffic-snarled cars attempting to leave the coast too late.  I tried not to look at the panicked faces inside the cars, lit by the headlights of those behind them.  All waiting to escape the storm.  Just like us, but powerless to move — to phase, if needed — the way we did.  Sucking on the cigarette, I slid lower onto the wornout springs of the back seat.  Slowly I pulled my gaze away from those we were leaving behind.

    One thing I learned from Oklahoma: if I thought about the people too much, I’d be worthless.

Rated R.  Contains graphic violent imagery, intense themes of natural and man-made disasters, and incidental profanity.  Not one of our lighter stories.

to try it. About two minutes ago. 

Rated G.  Kids, don’t try this at home.

<p><i>      She did not particularly care whether he paid; it wasn&#8217;t her inn.  But 
at his words she lifted an eyebrow.  &#8220;What sort of challenge?&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>      &#8220;A very special one.&#8221;  He slipped a hand into his coat like an 
old-fashioned pistolero, but before Franca could worry he pulled out a 
bulging sack made of what looked like deerhide.  He set this on the table &#8212; carefully, Franca noted.</i></p>

<p><i>      &#8220;You are willing to follow a recipe?  So many chefs of your caliber 
think themselves above the direction of others.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>      She lifted her chin.  &#8220;I was head chef for Parliament once &#8212; before 
that bastard Berlusconi, anyhow.  While I was there I had to make Florentine 
dishes like a Florentine and Venetian dishes like a Venetian and the Madonna 
help me if I did them wrong.  If the recipe is sound, I can follow it.&#8221;

      She did not particularly care whether he paid; it wasn’t her inn.  But

      “You are willing to follow a recipe?  So many chefs of your caliber 
think themselves above the direction of others.”

      She lifted her chin.  “I was head chef for Parliament once — before 
that bastard Berlusconi, anyhow.  While I was there I had to make Florentine 
dishes like a Florentine and Venetian dishes like a Venetian and the Madonna 
help me if I did them wrong.  If the recipe is sound, I can follow it.”
