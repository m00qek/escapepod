Techno-Rat
by Brad Hafford
West London was, as always, abuzz. Even at 4:00 AM on a chilly November Tuesday, electric motorcars whirred down Kings Road, zipping people along, early to work or late from parties. The residential side streets, however, were quiet. Lined with parked cars, occasional street lamps, and darkened flats, they dozed peacefully. Ornate houses huddled in gracefully curving queues, awaiting the sunrise with little attention to the two figures loitering outside their narrow, iron-fenced entryways.
“There it is, innit?” the scrawnier figure said, pointing to a parked car. “D’ya see?”
The taller man stared intently at the vehicle. “See what?” he said, his breath misting in the frosty air.
Their eyes were fixed on a car sitting at the curb of a constricted street in Chelsea, part of the fashionable Kensington district. It was a brown cabriolet with a weather-worn faux leather top. An aging example, its low-light number plates showed it to be registered ten years previously. Its MOT and inspection were up to date, but its bonnet was dented and its windscreen cracked. Such an automobile did not belong in Chelsea. But neither did the two men examining it.
The smaller of the two impatiently tugged on the grey flatcap he wore. “Pay attention, Mik,” he sniped. “We in’t got all night.” Clipped words and rounded vowels marked his speech. The bells of St. Mary’s were ancient history and the East End had long since been gentrified, but he was retro-Cockney.
“I’m paying as much attention as I’ve got, Artie. More, really. I just don’t see it.”
“It’s a slight vibration, see. An ’ologram shift called glitching. The generator keeps the image dynamic, right. So it has to refresh at a specific rate.” He tapped his nose, a signal that he was imparting secrets. “Oy, there it goes again!”
“I still don’t see it.”
“And you fink you got what it takes to be a Techno-Rat?”
“It was Uncle Lazlo’s idea, not mine.” Mik said. His speech was not as thick as his teacher’s. It carried the calmer, neutral accent of the Midlands.
“’E was a great tea leaf, was Lazlo Utzbahn, but ’e’s been ’round for yonks. Since afore the ’lectric laws. Maybe his judgement’s gone tits up.”
“Give me a break, Artie. I’m trying, you know.”
“Awright, awright. Look down this street. What d’ya see?”
“A bunch of cars.”
“No, you stupid tosser. You see a bunch o’ targets. Now, which d’ya go for?”
Mik examined the narrow street, a mere alleyway but packed with sleeping transport. It was a car thief’s dream. Some of the latest models lay there, prime for the taking. But despite the calm appearance of the darkened streets, security was tight.
“Um, that one.” Mik pointed to an angular contraption glistening like mercury frozen in ice. “The shiny one with the big fins.”
“Crikey! Could’ya be more obvious? Even if you got past its AI, you’d be spotted in a second, mate. Plus it’s all show. The Tatzu Shark breaks down every hundred kilometers like clockwork. It’s utter bollocks. Try again.”
“Could you, uh, give us a clue?”
“Watch for the tar, mate. Watch for the tar.”
“Tar?”
“Cor, you are green, in’t ya? Tar and pitch&#8211;glitch!”
“But I don’t see this glitch, or tar, or whatever it is.”
“It’s like I been tryin’ to show ya. Watch this ’ere cabriolet close-like. Wait fer it&#8230; There!”
Mik’s light blue eyes flickered with recognition. “Hey, I saw it that time! Like it glittered for a second.”
“More like a nanosecond, mate. And as generators go, this one’s shite. For the pico-second freqs, you gotta be damn good.” Artie positioned Mik by the passenger door of the car. “Now touch it,” he said. “Feel the roof.”
Mik pushed up the sleeve of his dark blue anorak as if to put his hand in a bucket of water. “Take off the gloves you berk,” Artie chastised.

Flowing Shapes

Part One: Contemplation
The human came to She Shalu on the Day of Flowering Awareness. Damo met him near the Still Garden, the fumes of the exiting shuttle mixing with the sharp spice of the tall, white twizak plant. Damo wore a humanoid shape so as to minimize the stranger&#8217;s discomfort.
Damo studied the human with the practiced eyes of a Synan. Dark hair covered his head and parts of his body, and he was sleight of build, despite the solidity of his form. About 1.7 meters tall. His features were mostly smooth, bones prominent, eyes with the barest hint of a slant. A mouth surrounded by full lips.
&#8220;How may I help you?&#8221; Damo said, trying to sound gracious.
&#8220;I came to study Wan She,&#8221; the human said.
Damo felt his features flow with his astonishment. Perhaps he had not heard correctly, or his translation module was malfunctioning. &#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Wan She is the Path of Flowing Shapes. It is a Synan practice. Humans, being incapable of shifting, cannot practice it.&#8221;
The human smiled, revealing straight, white teeth. &#8220;I know. I&#8217;m writing a book,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But isn&#8217;t it true that the first stage is concerned solely with contemplation? Surely that is not beyond a human.&#8221;
Damo stifled his urge to shift in response to his unease. Uncontrolled shifting was against the teachings of Wan She. &#8220;That is true,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But Wan She is a path. Not a series of distinct teachings. To step on that path is to begin a journey.&#8221;
&#8220;All I ask is that you let me speak to your Tanshe. Let him decide.&#8221;
Damo was all too willing to accommodate the human in this. Let the Tanshe decide. It certainly saved Damo the trouble of having to assimilate this odd request.
&#8220;Please follow me,&#8221; he said.
He led the human through the Still Garden, inhaling the heady scent of it, delighting in its exoticness. Most of the students overlooked the Still Garden, and in doing so missed out on one of the true beauties of She Shalu.
They moved through the pearlescent designs of the sanctuary’s hallways to the Tanshe’s bubbled door. &#8220;Wait here,&#8221; Damo said, then entered.
The Tanshe was in an original form, multilimbed, eyeless, lacking both ears and nose. Turning inward. Her bright amber skin was splattered with black inky spots. She looked up as Damo entered, eyes appearing from inside her face. Damo let his features droop in the customary manner. &#8220;Tanshe, there is a human to see you.&#8221;
The Tanshe&#8217;s features flowed and shifted until they were almost exactly a human&#8217;s. &#8220;Send it in,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And wait outside.&#8221;
Damo’s skin settled. He was not to be involved in this discussion. It was good. The Tanshe would deal with it and send the human away. Damo did as the Tanshe asked.
He waited outside, letting his features relax into the default Synan shape. He’d worn the humanoid one as a courtesy, and because it was polite and expected, but he disliked it. It was distasteful. Too firm. Too set.
He waited for some time, then the door bubble opened. He quickly shifted back into his humanoid form and turned to face the human, now exiting. &#8220;She told me to send you in,&#8221; the human said.
Damo looked at the human’s firm, immobile face. So alien. So disgusting.
Damo entered. &#8220;Yes, Tanshe?&#8221;
&#8220;I have decided to accept the human&#8217;s request to stay with us.&#8221;
&#8220;Tanshe?&#8221; Damo’s features wavered.
&#8220;I believe it will be beneficial for us,&#8221; the Tanshe said. &#8220;He is to be placed with the other novices in the First Stage. He will write about the Path. He will be an observer.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, Tansh[...]</itunes:summary>

Contamination
By Jay Werkheiser
Ari allowed his skimmer to brush the outer edge of Nouvelle Terre&#8217;s atmosphere. He tried to imagine air jostling the light nanofiber support frame, whistling through the skimmer&#8217;s magsails. Excitement pulsed through his veins at the thought of being so close to the blue-and-white surface, perhaps closer than any human had ever dared. Nothing but his skinsuit and a few hundred kilometers of atmosphere separated him from the living, breathing landscape below. He spread his arms and legs, trying to feel the miniscule tug of atmospheric drag.
Is that what wind feels like?
His faceplate HUD showed a ripple in the magsail&#8217;s yaw loop. The threat of a coil collapse brought his mind back into focus, and he hiked up the field strength to gain some altitude. He savored every precious minute the skimmer took to climb away from the atmosphere. Nouvelle Terre&#8217;s secondary sun climbed over the horizon, visible only because the primary sun hadn&#8217;t yet risen. He scanned the starry sky, taking advantage of the view before primary sunrise darkened his faceplate. Earth&#8217;s distant sun was almost directly overhead, a pinpoint at the tail of a zig-zag of stars. The drive flare that cut across the constellation chilled his good mood. After a generation of silence, what could the Earth people possibly want?
Bah. Figuring that out was the job of bureaucrats. Ari preferred jockeying around with a skimmer, launching and retrieving microprobes, and taking time to enjoy the freedom of flight. Before long, the Gardien rose above the limb of the planet. He&#8217;d be home within a half hour, pining for his next chance to fly free.
&#8220;That you, Ari?&#8221; If his solitude had to be interrupted by a human voice, he could do worse than Maura&#8217;s.
&#8220;Who else would it be?&#8221;
He knew damn well who she was afraid it might be. He tilted his head upward toward the spear of light that dominated the sky. A new ship from Earth arriving unannounced after all these years was reason enough to be on edge.

&#8220;I&#8217;ll have your approach vector in a moment.&#8221; Maura&#8217;s image in his faceplate wore the drive flare like a burning gash on her forehead. &#8220;Your drop was perfect. The microprobe will skim the atmosphere deep enough to pick up some dust samples, but high enough to avoid surface contamination. With any luck, some of those dust grains will carry living spores.&#8221;
&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t need luck if they&#8217;d let us dive lower. Damn Earthborn are too cautious.&#8221;
&#8220;You managed to get a pretty deep dive on that last orbit.&#8221; She pursed her lips in mock disapproval. &#8220;You&#8217;re going to catch hell for your little maneuver.&#8221;
&#8220;What? I was just dropping low for a perigee kick.&#8221;
Her laugh was pure music. &#8220;Good luck getting the director to buy that one. She&#8217;s in a foul mood.&#8221;
He snorted, momentarily fogging his faceplate. &#8220;She doesn&#8217;t need my help. Dear old Mom takes foul to a new level, even for an Earthborn.&#8221;
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be cruel. They earned the right to be grumpy.&#8221;
&#8220;Maybe they&#8217;d be more caring if they hadn&#8217;t cranked us out of their wombs like an assembly line.&#8221;
&#8220;Have some respect. You don&#8217;t know how long they&#8217;ll be around.&#8221;
&#8220;We&#8217;ll be restocking our supply of Earthborn soon, from the looks of it.&#8221; He gestured toward the light as he spoke, even though his helmet&#8217;s cam couldn&#8217;t show it. &#8220;It warms my heart to know that even the Secretary-General has no idea why Earth sent a second ship after all these years.&#8221;
She huffed. &#8220;You have no respect for authority, Ari.&#8221;

Ashes on the Water
by Gwendolyn Clare
I hoped that Ranjeet&#8217;s friends were as disreputable as promised.  Ranjeet himself was late, of course.  I&#8217;d asked him to park his car out on the road and meet me behind the house&#8211;my cousin is, shall we say, out of favor, and I couldn&#8217;t afford to get caught with him.  So I sat on the dry, cracked ground in the shadow of the house, waiting where Father wouldn&#8217;t think to look for me.  A meter away, heat rose off the sun-baked earth, wavering like water, as if the dormant land dreamed of monsoon season.  I shut my eyes against the image.  For years now, each summer has come harsher than the last.
Soft footsteps in the dirt, and Ranjeet strolled around the corner of the house, calling, &#8220;You&#8217;ll never make it across the border, kid.&#8221;
I stood up and brushed the dust off my jeans, annoyed. Seventeen and he still calls me a kid.  &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you say that a little louder?  I don&#8217;t think the neighbors could hear you clearly.&#8221;
The closest neighbors live on the other side of a one-hectare vacant field that used to be the mango grove, before the mango trees withered.  I used to sit on Father&#8217;s shoulders to help with the harvest when I was small.  He keeps saying we&#8217;re going to replant the grove, but nobody&#8217;s all that eager to dig up the dead roots.
Ranjeet folded his arms and leaned back against the side of the house.  &#8220;You know it&#8217;s true.&#8221;
&#8220;Did you get the papers for me, or not?&#8221;
He pulled a thick envelope out of the inner pocket of his cream-colored sportcoat, but he held on to it, turning it over in his hands.  &#8220;What are you planning to do, smuggle it in your shoes?
You&#8217;re going to get caught.&#8221;
I held out my empty palm impatiently.  &#8220;What do I owe you?&#8221;
&#8220;Nothing.  This is a family matter, Riti.&#8221;  He passed the envelope reluctantly.  &#8220;Just don&#8217;t tell anyone where you got this.&#8221;
My fingers itched to open the envelope, but it would be rude to check the quality of the forgery with Ranjeet watching.  &#8220;You know I have to go.  I owe her that much.&#8221;
&#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t have asked you for this.&#8221;
&#8220;She didn&#8217;t need to.&#8221;  I would have given her much more without her asking.  I wished I could trade places and let her be the one to live, but I couldn&#8217;t.  All I had was this one thing left to do.
#
The day Priya died, I saved my water ration for washing the body.
Father did not approve.  He said we didn&#8217;t have the luxury of adhering to the old customs anymore.  He said I was being foolish, hurting myself for the sake of my dead sister.  Her soul had moved on, after all.  The body was just an empty shell.  He said that God had taken her.
Mother didn&#8217;t say anything at all.  She went out to sit on the balcony overlooking the almond grove.  Hands folded in her lap, she stared into the distance with dry, tired eyes.  The youngest of the almond trees were planted when I was seven, and Mother used to sit up there to watch Priya and me watering the saplings through their first difficult summer.  I wondered if she thought about that, now.  She refused to eat or drink, or even sleep.  I think she scared Father.
That left Grandmother and me to wash Priya and change her clothes.  Grandmother&#8217;s fingers look as brittle as old sticks, but she held the sponge steadily, patting it against Priya&#8217;s cold skin with a serene gentleness.  Mine were the hands that shook while I brushed out my sister&#8217;s lustrous dark hair.
At least her eyes were closed.  There had always been something in her eyes&#8211;a deep compassion, as if she really saw not just me, but everyone&#8211;and I didn&#8217;t want to k[...]</itunes:summary>

Follow that Cathedral!
By Gareth Owens
…and with that Pixie dived from the open door of the Zeppelin. The air around her suddenly becoming liquid, rushing over the smooth leather of her helmet and bringing tears to her eyes.
“Always some bloody thing!” she grinned into the gale, falling headlong towards the welcoming embraces of Mother Earth and Mother Russia below.
Siberian night enveloped her, storm filled frozen darkness, cloud shrouded full moon, and below, the steam powered lightning of The Iron Czar. A hissing, glowing, monster of a train, three storeys high, and even longer than the leviathan Fourteen Bags of Mischief hanging above.
Pixie saw the orange furnaces erupting sparks through the twin stacks, as if Hephaestus himself stoked on the imperial railways.
Kirby wires between Pixie and the nose of the airship took up the slack, her harness tightened, squeezing the breath from her as she slid down the gradient gravity prescribes for a pendulum. Spreading her arms out wide she released the winglets of her full-length leather drop-coat, ankle wings for trim springing from her boots. Suddenly the harness became her trapeze and she somersaulted with creak of leather, freed into the hundred-knot headwind.
Orange fire below and frozen storm above, these were the moments Pixie lived for. Card tricks in the dark. A moment of genius for her own consumption and not for the sharing. She flew alone, arms wide, graceful as an angel dancer sweeping over a darkened stage. The first swing reached the peak of gravity assistance and Pixie saw the roof of the train below her slow in comparison, stopping for a second just past the midpoint of her pendulum arc, then once more seeming to gather pace against her, leaving her trailing as she fell back.
“There have got to be easier ways for a pirate girl to catch a train,” she said.
With an emphatic flick, she opened her drop-coat out wide, catching the full blast of the wind, whipping her back up the arc of swing like a human kite. Then, pulling her arms into her sides she rocketed forwards again, a bullet through the air, streamlining, catching the train once more but this time lower as Jeti tried to match the altitude of the dirigible.
Eyes wide, Pixie saw the end of the last carriage, a black wall lit with a single dim red eye of a lamp. A sudden graunch through the cable, the winch bit, dragging her six feet further up in the air. Her speed increased as the cable shortened. She flew far too close and far too fast, sweeping up, only just carrying over the edge of the roof, arms held out backwards like the Spirit of Ecstasy. The bitter smelling pitch of the Russian rustproof coating mere inches below her nose. She lifted at the end of the swing, snapping upright, and with a perfect matching of momentum, she stood, placing her boots down and solid on Imperial rolling stock.
A single twist to the circular brass locking clasp and she shrugged free of the harness and drop-coat, before it could pull her over backwards. Jingling cable fading away into the storm as her crew winched it back. Pixie’s knee length mini-crini sprang back into shape, like a chrysanthemum released from a fist.
She wore the dark red corset, all the rage in St Petersburg Jeti assured her, but always with that twinkle in her eye. Pixie never knew whether her second-in-command was joking at her expense or not.
Pixie set off at the run towards the storming volcano of the armour-plated engine. She knew she should put Jeti off at the next port, but she just couldn&#8217;t do it to her. Dear, sweet Jeti van Borkel, the girl might not have been the best steersman this side of the Roaring Forties, but she did have such a cute popo, particularly in those Oxford bags she wore.
Momentarily distracted, Pixie nearly tripped over a spinning [...]</itunes:summary>

Chasers
by Scott W. Baker
Sebastian&#8217;s organs squeezed into his pelvis as he accelerated past point-one.  He had a good feeling this time.  This catch was going to be his.
He could see his objective ahead of him, the enormous Drifter-class colony ship Calypso barreling through space on her inertial journey from Earth to Terra III.  Since she carried no fuel for deceleration, Calypso would travel through space forever without Chasers like Sebastian.  It was the job of a Chaser to run down Drifters and fill their tanks.  The job had sounded easy when he signed with Mulligan Mining eight months ago.  But despite nine arrivals since then, Sebastian has not made one catch.
Calypso was a slow Drifter at a mere point-13 c.  Surely he could catch that.  His Skeeter was designed to reach point-2, faster and more maneuverable than any other company&#8217;s ships.  Yet what advantages Skeeters held in speed and agility they sacrificed in capacity.  Even if he caught the Drifter, it took a total of three Skeeters to fill her.
Sebastian ran a scan of Calypso.  Leonard was already docked.  That was too fast for him to have waited for the Drifter&#8217;s beacon; he must have taken his Skeeter out without confirmation a Drifter was coming in.  Lucky.  Blind patrols were expensive gambles, especially on a Chaser&#8217;s budget.  The exorbitant price of fuel on Earth was the primary reason Drifter-class colonizers dominated the colonization market, and a booming fuel industry made Terra III the most popular destination.  Like most things, it boiled down to money.
A pair of blips appeared on Sebastian&#8217;s nav screen. Two ships were approaching from behind.  The tiny blip indicated the presence of another Skeeter, the third they&#8217;d need to fill the Calypso.  The larger blip was an Essex Bus, a hundred-percent capacity tanker from a rival fuel company.  Rather, Essex was the rival of Mulligan.   Both Sebastian and the other Skeeter would have to beat this Bus if Mulligan was going to make the sale.  If the Bus docked first, the sale would go to Essex.  One Bus could do the job of three Skeeters, assuming it could get to the colony ship first.
Sebastian pushed his engines harder.
The big blip was moving fast for a ship its size.  It drew closer until Sebastian could see it through his canopy.  It was more than three times the size of his little Skeeter and was now careening at point-16 c.  &#8220;Damn,&#8221; Sebastian whispered as he was overtaken, &#8220;I thought Busses maxed out at point-15.&#8221;  It was the reason Sebastian had signed with Mulligan instead of Essex: the need for speed.  Busses just weren&#8217;t meant to go that fast.  But even one percent of the speed of light could mean the difference between a bonus check and a long flight back to port.  If a Chaser could finagle a little extra zip out of his ship, he did.  Apparently this Bus pilot was a finagler.
Sebastian adjusted his fuel ratios and pushed his engines even harder.  The ship began to vibrate around him.  Still the Bus pulled away.  &#8220;One Skeeter already on and Essex is going to get the sale anyway,&#8221; Sebastian said.  He started the calculations for his return to port.
&#8220;You ain&#8217;t giving up, are you?&#8221; a voice croaked across the closed-circuit communicator.  Closed-circuit meant it was another Mulligan pilot.
&#8220;Repeat?&#8221; Sebastian replied.
&#8220;Bas, that you?&#8221;  Only one person ever called him Bas.
&#8220;Roger, this is Sebastian.  What&#8217;s your twenty, Wild?&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be on your screen in a shake.&#8221;
&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother.  I was just passed by a Bus going point-16.&#8221;
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t Freebird already on?&#8221;  Wild meant Leonard.  He refused to call anyone by their actual name, inclu[...]</itunes:summary>

Like a Hawk in Its Gyre
by Philip Brewer
The bicycle noticed someone was following before Kurt did.  Watching for a tail was a habit he&#8217;d finally broken himself of, but not before the bicycle&#8217;s impressionable brain had picked it up.  Its low warning hum sent a thrill of adrenalin through him, giving power to the part of his brain that wanted him to sprint away.
Kurt glanced back down the single track.  The trees were already beginning to turn fall colors around the edges of the forest, but here along the narrow trail the foliage was green and thick.  Resisting the urge to pick up the pace, he continued on, looking back when he could take his eyes off the trail, and after a few moments caught sight of what the bicycle had seen.
&#8220;It&#8217;s just another cyclist,&#8221; Kurt said, reaching down to pat the bicycle&#8217;s yellow-and-black, hornet-striped frame.  The bicycle didn&#8217;t understand&#8211;its brain was small and lacked the regions for understanding speech&#8211;but Kurt&#8217;s tone of voice calmed it and the warning hum grew softer and less anxious.
The end of the trail, a scenic overlook above the Vermillion River, was not far ahead, but the overtaking bicyclist was approaching even faster.  The polite thing to do would be to find a place to pull off the trail and let the cyclist past.  But there were no surveillance devices in the forest, and Kurt couldn&#8217;t face meeting someone out of sight of some sort of watching eyes.  At just the thought of it, his adrenaline surged again.
Letting his brain chemistry have its way with him, Kurt leaned low over his handlebars and pedaled hard.
With its good forward eyes, the bicycle watched the trail, sending little twitches into the steering to help Kurt take the best line.  On the road it didn&#8217;t make much difference, but on a technical trail the bicycle&#8217;s assist could add several percent to his speed.
Giving in to the urge to sprint away took some of the pressure off, enough that Kurt had a chance to think.  The urge to find surveillance cameras&#8211;the need to do nothing that wasn&#8217;t observed&#8211;was one that he&#8217;d had some time to get used to.  Even, to an extent, come to terms with.  What his brain needed was watching eyes.  It wanted surveillance cameras, but those weren&#8217;t the only kind of eyes.  His own two didn&#8217;t count, but there were others.  His bicycle had eight.  And the forest was full of eyes.  He could hear a woodpecker hammering not far off, the buzzing of deer flies around his head, and rustlings in the litter that might be frogs or small mammals.  They all had eyes.  Focusing on that, Kurt was able to ease his speed down and brake to a stop as he reached the end of the trail, where a wide, clear area looked out over the river.
Breathing hard, he looked back down the trail.  He started to reach for his water bottle, but the trembling in his hand made him wait.
The approaching rider was dressed like a cyclist&#8211;lycra shorts, padded gloves, helmet, wrap-around amber shades.  The bike had a rack over the rear wheel and a large bag, as big as the bag that Kurt had on his own bike, big enough for a picnic lunch and a six-pack of beer.  The man angled toward the other side of the viewing area and jumped off his bike a good distance away.
Kurt began to relax.  The lack of surveillance was fine if they didn&#8217;t interact.  The clearing, nearly flat until it dipped sharply down to the river, began to feel a little more comfortable.  His breathing slowed and he calmed down enough to smell the moist dirt.  He pulled out his water bottle.
&#8220;Hello, Kurt,&#8221; said the man.
Kurt&#8217;s hand tightened, forcing a narrow spray of water out the top of the bottle.
&#8220;My name&#8217;s Starkweather. [...]</itunes:summary>

Connoisseurs of the Eccentric
by Jetse de Vries
Salvador Dalí took his pet ocelot to a New York restaurant, where a woman protested that wild animals were being allowed in. Dalí replied it was only a cat he’d painted in op-art style. The woman looked closer: “Now I can see it’s a cat,” she said. “At first, I thought it was an ocelot.”
Seated near the swimming pool in the artist’s retreat in Port Lligat, a BBC interviewer said that he had “heared that Dalí was unkind to animals. Was that true?”
“Dalí cruel to ze animal?” The artist exclaimed, “Nevair!” After which he picked up his pet ocelot and hurled it into the swimming pool.
—Eccentric anecdotes;
I SEE HER arriving in her private vacuum zeppelin, flying over the rewilded mountains of the Nagasaki peninsula, while I’m tending the extreme bonsai wine garden on top of my farmscraper. Expertly manoeuvering through the photovoltaic city forest, the zep berthes at the telescopic docking station. It gives me time to change from my gardening attire into something more formal.
Originally, she found me through my hyperdense pinot noir à la bonsaïe, almost two decades ago. Back then, I proudly showed her my grotto garden, but she quickly decided that she liked my ecological acumen better than my micro bonsai specimen. Today, for the second time only, she comes unnanounced.
I come prepared, but even my Icho’s ‘the power of light and shadow’ complemented with a pair of Peron &#038; Peron’s is no match for the way Afri Kamari makes an off-the-shelf, demure business suit look like haute couture. Above ebony cheekbones: deep brown eyes that see straight through you. Under a head of long, thick, fine curls: a brain that never shifts from top gear. Inside a very conservative skirtsuit: an animated sensuality that puts any anime girl to shame.
Thousands of times I’ve talked with her over vidcon and — recently — EPIT-link: but when I see her in the flesh, I’m both entranced and edgy. I open my special cabinet and start uncorking my Takashima pinot noir — still the most exclusive wine in the world — to celebrate her extremely rare personal visit. She takes her time to smell, taste and enjoy it. Not bad for a beer aficionado, part of me thinks, while another part wishes she would cut to the chase. Neither needs to wait long.
“Superb,” she says, “the Delirium Nocturnum of wine.”
“Which you didn’t find special enough to sell to the aliens.” I remind her.
“It’s phenomenal craftsmanship, second to none, but not quite . . . eccentric enough.”
“Well, you are the true connoisseur,” I try to hide my frustration behind my half-full glass, in vain, “the best of the world.”
“The best of this world.” Her eyes shine like crazy diamonds. “It’s time to expand the market.”
“You don’t need me for the mad part of your schemes. Am I not the orderly yin to your chaotic yang?”
“I do. You can deliver a quintessential part for this project.”
The moment I’ve most feared and longed for in my life. “What is it?”	
Her amused smile broadens. “Your soul.”
#
THE ALIENS ARE still alien. After twenty years, nobody knows how they look like, where they came from or even how many there are. Yet, out of the grey they came.
Of all places, the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence ended when it received a clear, unencrypted message from the Moon, about the only place where SETI wasn’t looking. The aliens said they declined to say who they were and where they came from, as that was ‘irrelevant’. They said they came in peace, looking for trade. They declared the Moon off-limits, while the rest of our solar system was open ‘to explore as you see fit’.
The trade items they were looking for were something else: they weren’t interested in our science &#038; technology, art &#038; history or culture &#038; biology in general. They didn’t want to tell us[...]</itunes:summary>

Three-Quarters Martian
C.R. Hodges
The first man to walk on the moon was a hero to five generations. The first woman to walk on Mars was forgotten even before her boots plunked into the red dust.
&#160;
“Hey,” a husky voice said in the dark.
I ignored her: the Swedish hockey team was calling to me from the sauna.
“Anna-Jing.” Same voice. A large hand grasped my shoulder.
I was losing my battle to recapture the fading dream.
“Wake up,” commanded a new voice in a rich brogue, “now.”
I took a deep breath, tasting the dust in the cool air, then slowly opened my eyes. Pulling the threadbare blanket around me, I sat up in my hammock.
Kaiza, the first and likely last aboriginal Australian to teach planetary astrophysics at Stanford, gently removed her hand from my shoulder. “Trouble in Florida.”
“The launch isn’t today.” I said, still groggy. Our resupply rocket was scheduled to lift off from Cape Lee in a week. We needed this one—the last launch, from Kazakhstan, had crashed in West Korea.
“There won’t be a fecking launch,” said Mick, our mission commander. He gestured at the wall screen, which snapped to life. Grainy footage showed a giant rocket lying on its side like a beached whale, next to a familiar gantry. A dozen old pickups were parked beyond the shattered nosecone. Scores of horses and four oxen grazed nearby, a web of cables and ropes leading back to the rocket. A horde of men and women in shorts and tank tops, flip-flops and baseball caps, were prying metal panels from the side of the rocket. Hundreds more lay dead on the ground, interspersed with the bodies of gray vested soldiers.
“Where are the pitchforks and torches?” I asked. No reply.
A helicopter arrived, ten commandos zip lining to the ground just meters from the camera crew. Seventy looters went down in the first minute, but then flight after flight of arrows from unseen archers decimated the commandos.
“Goodbye freeze-dried steak and potatoes,” said Mick.
“Goodbye replacement mini reactor.” I pointed at the four oxen dragging a sledge with a brightly marked container the size of a large desk.
“Gotta crank the thermostat down again,” said Mick. He lumbered off to make it so.
The last image we witnessed before a sword crashed down on the camera lens was a line of children siphoning kerosene from the rocket’s fuel tank into buckets. Goodbye civilization.
#
Carrying a basket of mushrooms three times my size, I trudged back to the main module from the redhouse. As I passed the Gagarin, I searched for those first boot prints—my boot prints—but they were covered in dust. I should’ve at least gotten a shoe contract.
The crew was waiting for me just inside the airlock. The mushrooms, the one food item that we could grow in near native conditions, added flavor to endless soy based meals despite being red and gritty. They were not, however, tasty enough to warrant an all hands greeting.
“The Chinese sent the offer,” said Gabriel before I had my helmet off. He was our geologist and physician.
“And what is the emperor proposing?” I asked. It had been three weeks of frustrating negotiations. We desperately needed provisions; they had the only rockets left.
Mick shrugged and tossed me the tablet. “My Mandarin is limited to ordering up pints and whores.”
“He’d pay more for a pint,” said Olga, my copilot and Mick’s former hammock buddy. Her quirky sense of humor had helped us through numerous rough patches over the years, but it was getting old.
I scrolled through the long winded missive until I got to the crux of the deal. I looked up. Really up—the rest of the crew dwarfed me. Even Gabriel had fifteen centimeters on me, and he could have been a jockey. “They’re offering to send us a rocket full of supplies.”
“In return for?” asked Kaiza.
“Planting their flag on Olympus Mons.”

Grandmother
by Cat Rambo
Most people called her Phoenix. Her former crew used “Captain” before that and “Sir” afterward. Ruby and Ada respectively called her “mother” and “g&#8217;ma.” Her hair was silver &#8211; not white, but genuine, metallic silver, a long fall against her pale blue skin, the color of a shadow on a piece of willow ware, that made her seems ageless despite the century and more that lay upon her, not to mention all those decades of pirating.
They said she&#8217;d been the best slideboard rider of her time, and perhaps the best battleship pilot of all time, back before her parents and sister were killed and she turned rogue.
They said she had done terrible things in her pirate days.
They said she&#8217;d been ruthless in her rise to power, moving up the chain from god knows where, an origin she&#8217;d never, ever spoken of to anyone, not even her own daughter. She&#8217;d killed some captains, slept with others, called in favors and maneuvered and betrayed and seized power with a brutal efficiency that still underlay what now seemed a calm and orderly, rules-bound government that she and Mukopadhyay had created.
They said she had killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people &#8212; sometimes at a distance, sometimes up close, with knife or fist. They said she&#8217;d killed a crew member when the shuttle she was in needed its mass reduced and the man hadn&#8217;t even argued, just nodded and stepped into the airlock, never said a word as the door closed and the lock cycled, staring in at his captain as she stared back.
They said time had mellowed her.  They said working with Mukopadhyay, even though he was crazy as a spiral comet, had mellowed her.
They said helping colonize a whole planet, setting up its government, the rich and intricate power structure that now encompassed the whole solar system called Shiva, had mellowed her.
Not to mention motherhood, they said, a change which no pregnant woman escapes. It alters the hormones in your body. Softens you. Makes you less rash, less harsh. Takes away even the sharpest edge, not to mention the hormonal craziness, which some women never recover from, after all.
Sure, changes you in a good way, they were quick to say.  But definitely softer.
They said she&#8217;d never do those sorts of things now.
# 
Phoenix left the curtain fall back into place. The blue velvet slid silently. The street lamp&#8217;s stripe of white light that had sliced across her face as she looked out was extinguished as quickly as a candle in the high-ceilinged dressing room&#8217;s dim light.
She said, “The weather is terrible for this. It always is. Why we chose this time of year for Founding Day, I don&#8217;t know.”
Her gown was armor and stiff brocade and jewels, the last crusted along hem and collar, cobalt crystals fastened in place with a netting of braided gold thread. More such jewels made up the elaborate earrings she wore, which ran along the lobe and upward, flaring to cup the almost-elvish point.
Gareth guessed that none of it was her original appearance. And what did that mean, that this woman choose to present herself as a creature of blue glass and silver lines, that she&#8217;d chosen to have two moth-like antennae implanted on her forehead, curled close and hidden as eyebrows most of the time, but capable of uncurling to sample the air? Few saw those.
Only his status as latest lover, as consort-in-training, had allowed him ingress to her bedchamber and the moments when she lay against silver satin that blended with the shimmer of her hair.
Hard to imagine those moments now, when she looked forged of authority and iron.
She belied that look &#8212; was ever woman so changeable? &#8212; as she came towards him, stooped to where he sat on the foot of [...]</itunes:summary>

The Caretaker
by Ken Liu
Motors whining, the machine squats down next to the bed, holding its arms out parallel to the ground. The metal fingers ball up into fist-shaped handholds. The robot has transformed into something like a wheelchair with treads, its lap the seat where my backside is supposed to fit.
A swiveling, flexible metal neck rises over the back of the chair, at the end of which are a pair of camera lenses with lens hood flaps on top like tilted eyebrows. There&#8217;s a speaker below the cameras, covered by metal lips. The effect is a cartoonish imitation of a face.
&#8220;It&#8217;s ugly,&#8221; I say. I try to come up with more, but that&#8217;s the only thing I can think of.
Lying on the bed with my back and neck propped up by all these pillows reminds me of long-ago Saturday mornings, when I used to sit up like this in bed, trying to catch up on grading while Peggy was still asleep next to me. Suddenly, Tom and Ellen would burst through the bedroom door without knocking and jump into the bed, landing on top of us in a heap, smelling of warm blankets and clamoring for breakfast.
Except now my left leg is a useless weight, anchoring me to the mattress. The space next to me is empty. And Tom and Ellen, standing behind the robot, have children of their own.
&#8220;It&#8217;s reliable,&#8221; Tom says. Then he seems to have run out of things to say, too. My son is like me, awkward with words when the emotions get complicated.
After a few seconds of silence, his sister steps forward and stands next to the robot. Gently, she bends down to put a hand on my shoulder. &#8220;Dad, Tom is running out of vacation days. And I can&#8217;t take any more time off either because I need to be with my husband and kids. We think this is best. It&#8217;s a lot cheaper than a live-in aide.&#8221;
It occurs to me that this would make an excellent illustration of the arrow of time: the care that parents devote to children is asymmetrical with the care that their children can reciprocate. Far more vivid than any talk of entropy.
Too bad I no longer have students to explain this to. The high school has already hired a new physics teacher and baseball coach.
I don&#8217;t want to get maudlin here and start quoting Lear. Hadn&#8217;t Peggy and I each left our parents to the care of strangers in faraway homes? That&#8217;s life.
Who wants to weigh their children down the way my body now weighs me down? My guilt should trump theirs. We are a nation built on the promise that there are no roots. Every generation must be free to begin afresh somewhere else, leaving the old behind like fallen leaves.
I wave my right arm &#8211; the one arm that still obeys me. &#8220;I know.&#8221; I would have stopped there, but I keep going because Peggy would have said more, and she&#8217;s always right. &#8220;You&#8217;ve done more than enough. I&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty intuitive to operate,&#8221; Ellen says. She doesn&#8217;t look at me. &#8220;Just talk to it.&#8221;
#
The robot and I stare at each other. I look into the cameras, caricatures of eyes, and see nothing but a pair of distorted, diminished images of myself.
I understand the aesthetics of its design, the efficient, functional skeleton softened by touches of cuteness and whimsy. Peggy and I once saw a show about caretaker robots for the elderly in Japan, and the show explained how the robots&#8217; kawaii features were intended to entice old people into becoming emotionally invested in and attached to the lifeless algorithm-driven machines.
I guess that&#8217;s me now. At sixty, with a stroke, I&#8217;m _old_ and an invalid. I need to be taken care of and fooled by a machine.
&#8220;Wonderful,&#8221; I say. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll be such pals.&#8221;

Talking to the Enemy
By Don Webb
We knew a little, but we knew the Free Machines knew more. We hoped our adversary, the Belatrin, knew less; but since they were such creatures of dream and nightmare even at the late parts of the War, we suspected they knew everything.
The Peace Conference hadn’t happened in the first six months of our being here. Everyone talked about it. Breakthroughs were rumored everyday. The only hard facts are that we had grown more efficient at killing Belatrin and they us.
The “peace planet” was named Mrs. Roger Fishbaum III. Roger Fishbaum had paid currency to name a star after his wife in the International Star Registry a thousand years before. The Siirians had a name for it that had too many clicks and whistles, the Free Machines a binary designation, and for all we knew the Belatrin used telepathy. The planet stank of vinegar and moldy bread. I always assumed that its atmosphere contained some needful compound for our enemies’ breathing, but maybe the Free Machines choose it to annoy us, or them.
Siirian merchants made the most of our discomfort. They sold ineffective air shields that released some herbal concoction. I was buying one when I made my ironic remark about the peace talks. The merchant polished its carapace with two of its legs and whistled out a message that my implant made into, “Honored customer, do you think you will be the chief negotiator for the peace talks?”
I set my translator for ironic mode, and said, “Most certainly. My lowly position as a Viscount of the Instrumentality qualifies me far better than the Dukes of Diplomacy.”
“No doubt this is true my friend.” The implant registered no irony. His carapace had the oranges and whites of early middle age. He could have fought in the Human-Siirian wars, back when is all right to call them “Crabs” to their eyestalks. The high-ranking families of the bureaucracy had commanded legions seeking to kill him, while my family had huddled in the ghettos of Earth. His long claw, a good two meters, reached over and pinned the air shield to my shirt. “Wear it in good health, honored customer.”
I strolled back to the Bureau, where others of the tribe of hereditary Bureaucrats busied themselves in meeting the latest proposal by the Free Machines. Since no human and no Belatrin could sit within two hundred yards of each other without permanent psychic damage to both parties, the Free Machines had built a “Peace Palace” where they would conduct negotiations to end the hundred year old war. Their fees were high, and it was our job to come up with some acceptable package of goods and services that wouldn’t wreck the economy of several planets. My boss Dame Patricia was joking that canned New Martian Champaign might do the trick, since it could be used to get the rust off.
It was wartime. Jokes were stale. They had been stale for a hundred years.
We were not stupid in the Bureau. We knew two things. Somewhere, higher ranking Bureaucrats – Dukes or Earls perhaps – were trying to make direct contact with the Belatrin. Everyone knew there had to be a way. After all they looked like us. Or at least in our part of space they had bodies and looked like us. The other thing we knew is that the Belatrin had a building just like ours on the other side of the planet, presumably filled with cost-cutting officials of some sort. It gave us great hope to believe that however different the souls of our enemies might be, they still looked for bargains.
Everyone laughed his or her stale laugh at the stale joke.
Dame Pat asked me, “What about you Sir Antele? Did your noontide walk inspire you to solve our dilemma?”
“It solved only the wretched smell of this world. It did not give me the ybleenth of a solution.”
“The what?” She asked.
“What, what?” I asked
“That word you said, yleebull? I don’t know it.”
“Ybleenth.[...]</itunes:summary>

Food for Thought
By Laura Lee McArdle
He didn&#8217;t look much like the humans I knew—their eyes squinting out of wind-burnt faces from atop the backs of their rude horses. This one had a face like butter, not a wrinkle to be seen. And he didn&#8217;t arrive on a horse, rude or otherwise, just popped out of thin air and started talking to me. Not at me. To me.
&#8220;Slow down,&#8221; I said flicking a fly off my broad backside. &#8220;Wilfred, right? You are responsible for the fence posts?&#8221;
&#8220;Yeah sure,&#8221; said Wilfred. &#8220;Now listen to me. I just need a thirty second vignette when I say &#8216;action&#8217;. Can you do that for me?
&#8220;Sure,&#8221; I said. I love to talk about myself.
&#8220;You heard the animal,&#8221; he shouted to no one I could see. &#8220;Food For Thought, take one. Action!&#8221;
&#8220;Uh, Bess here. Folks call me the conspiracy theorist.  And I laugh.  But honestly if you don’t spend some time speculating out here what are you going to do?  Me, I walk the fence, count the posts and calculate trigonometric functions.  And I am convinced there is a way to get my 1200 lb bulk past these 4000 odd posts and reams of barbed wire.
By the way, I’ve come pretty far with the weight issue, thank you very much. The secret is small frequent meals, so I pretty much eat a little bit all the time when I’m not counting posts.  The other trick, that I don’t think any of my sisters have clocked on to, is to just not use stomachs three and four. Sure it takes practice, even surgery for lesser minds, but if you don’t have a project out here you will simply go mad.
But I digress.  The fence around East Pasture, the present location of my languid existence, has 4409 posts.  That’s a rather large prime number. Coincidence? I think not! The fence is clearly a test to separate the truly intelligent from the herd.  Since I am clearly at the pinnacle of bovine braininess and already somewhat estranged from my herd I know it’s only a matter of time before I pass.&#8221;
&#8220;Cut!&#8221; screamed Wilfred beaming. &#8220;Bess, my dear, that was gorgeous.  You are a natural born… monologist.&#8221; He clapped and did a little dance that made his sequined garment bounce and sparkle in the sun.
&#8220;Monologist?  Is that a word?&#8221;
&#8220;Whatever. You, the monologue—the viewers are going to lap it up. I,&#8221; –he paused for effect- &#8220;am a genius.&#8221;
I snorted. &#8220;I thought you said I was the genius.&#8221;
&#8220;Did I say that?  I meant savant. Anyway, you found the posts and you&#8217;re coming in loud and clear on the translator, so season 24 is a go!&#8221; He degenerated into dancing again, executing an exuberant pirouette.
&#8220;Hold on a minute there Wilf. I did the little self-introduction you wanted.  I&#8217;ve been extremely cooperative. Now fill me in.  What&#8217;s the real deal with the fence?  Where did you come from and why are you testing me?&#8221;
Wilfred poked a handheld device with his index finger and yelled instructions toward some point behind him.
&#8220;Frank! Roll cameras I need tape of this!&#8221;
&#8220;Rolling Wilf,&#8221; a disembodied voice answered.
&#8220;Excellent. Now Bess, you know those humans who come here, check you over, give you medicine?&#8221; He grinned in a way that raised the hair on the back of my neck.
&#8220;Yeah&#8221;.
He leaned in close to my twitching ears.
&#8220;They grind you up and eat you.&#8221;
&#8220;I knew it!&#8221; I bellowed and stamped. &#8220;I&#8217;ve said it over and over again, but no-one takes me seriously. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.&#8221; I trotted in circles trying not to hyperventilate while Wilfred watched with obvious pleasure. &#8220;Wait a second.&#8221; I rounded on Wilfred. &#8220;You&#8217;re [...]</itunes:summary>

&#8220;This is a really bad idea, Elle,&#8221; Barry says.
&#8220;You didn&#8217;t have to come.&#8221;
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be stupid,&#8221; he snaps. &#8220;Phil would kill me if I didn&#8217;t come with you.&#8221;
Barry is fiftyish, portly and gray-haired. Seeing him take off his shirt is an experience I wish I&#8217;d never had.
&#8220;I have friends with certifications,&#8221; I say. &#8220;It&#8217;s not like I couldn&#8217;t have asked one of them.&#8221;
&#8220;How many of them have actually been down there?&#8221; It&#8217;s almost a growl, and I&#8217;m actually cowed a little. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I thought.&#8221;
I sit on the hard bench, wood planks covered in thin, all-weather carpet, and fiddle with my regulator.
&#8220;How far away do you think we are?&#8221; he asks.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t know. Ask the captain.&#8221;
Barry looks up at the bridge, where Al &#8212; the captain &#8212; stands, driving the boat. Al is even older than Barry, narrow and hard and tanned almost leathery with decades of exposure to the sun. Instead of going up to talk to him, though, Barry goes around the cabin to stand by the bow, leaving me bouncing up and down on the bench as the boat zips across the water. The light chop makes the horizon rise and fall faster than is comfortable. I can take it, though, and if I get sick enough to throw up, at least I know enough to do it over the side.
My guess is that we&#8217;re ten minutes from the dive site. Maybe fifteen.
After waiting seven years to get my answers, fifteen minutes isn&#8217;t much of a wait at all.
#
I was seven when I first realized my dad was doing more than just studying the life cycle of coral reefs. I&#8217;d been in the ocean with Grandpa; I knew what they looked like. I knew there were natural ones and artificial ones; I knew that if you touched a reef, part of it could die, and that if you touched fire coral, you&#8217;d burn.
The big tank at Dad&#8217;s office had plenty of coral inside. I separated myself from him &#8212; it was easy; he was so focused on his work that when I said I had to go to the bathroom he didn&#8217;t even notice &#8212; and went off on my own.
No one watched me climb up on a chair. No one noticed my nose was so close to the water that all I could smell was salt. No one saw me reach in and brush the back of my hand on the bright-orange coral flower.
The scream made Dad come running. He picked me up as I cried and shouted, carried me to a chair, and told me to hold out my arm. Then he poured clear liquid over my skin: vinegar, like what Mom used to clean the floor. It didn&#8217;t make the burn stop hurting, but it helped, and after a few minutes I started to calm down.
&#8220;What happened?&#8221;
When I looked at Dad, it was through a blur of tears. &#8220;I reached in the tank,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I touched the coral.&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, come on!&#8221; Dad said &#8212; almost yelled. &#8220;I&#8217;ve told you before: this isn&#8217;t a game! It&#8217;s not a place to play! This is my job, and if you can&#8217;t behave, you can stay home with your brother next time. You got that?&#8221;
I stared at him for a second, then burst into fresh tears. Dad shook his head and crouched in front of me. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Eleanora. I didn&#8217;t mean to shout. You just&#8230; worried me. And you know you shouldn&#8217;t have touched something that was going to hurt you, right?&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8230;&#8221; A hiccup. &#8220;I&#8217;m&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry, Daddy&#8230;&#8221;
He leaned forward and hugged me, rubbing my back. &#8220;Come on. I&#8217;ll get my things, and we can go home.&#8221;
&#8220;&#8216;Kay.&#8221;
He asked me to sit in his desk chair and wait while he called Mom. He&#8217;d left his computer turned on, and I read[...]</itunes:summary>

Observer Effects
By Tim Pratt
&#8220;Ubiquitous surveillance isn&#8217;t the problem. Asymmetrical ubiquitous surveillance is the problem.&#8221; The Liberator was playing Chinese checkers against himself and talking, talking, talking, like always. &#8220;Who watches the watchmen, after all?&#8221;
We were superheroes then. Celebrities, back when there were such things. It was a slow night at orbital headquarters, and Eye-Oh was
sitting at the big screen, watching a couple of people fuck &#8212; consensually, or we would have done something about it &#8212; in an
alleyway. The screen was green with night-vision enhancements, and Eye-Oh&#8217;s strange complicated face was perfectly placid and empty as he observed.
&#8220;The problem is that we can watch ordinary people, and they can&#8217;t watch us,&#8221; the Liberator went on. He looked at me longingly, searchingly, and I thought it might be nice to tweak the inside of his brain and get rid of his earnestness, give him a little taste of what infamous brain-damage victim Phineas Gage got when that iron bar slammed through his frontal lobe, a total personality turnaround, from nice guy to sociopath. Let the Liberator be selfish and impulsive and violent and mercurial for a while, so he could appreciate the way normal avaricious sneaky hungry desperate needy people felt.
But that was supervillain thinking, and I&#8217;d gone straight and narrow. In those days I cured neurological damage instead of inflicting it. I fixed people. (Except bad people. Those, I was sometimes still allowed to play with with.) I&#8217;d refused to give up my supervillain name though. The Liberator had wanted to call me &#8220;Dr. Neuro&#8221; when I joined his little boys&#8217; club, but I&#8217;d insisted on keeping my maiden name, as it were. Doctor. Please. I was a high-school dropout.
&#8220;Do you see?&#8221; the Liberator said. &#8220;If ordinary people could see us, if everyone could see everyone else, it wouldn&#8217;t matter if there were no privacy.&#8221;
&#8220;Mmm,&#8221; I said, and tried to keep reading my book, a physics textbook. I was deep into a chapter on Heisenberg. His big achievement was the uncertainty principle, which says you can&#8217;t know both the position and the momentum of a given particle at the same time. (I know, you know that. But like I said, I didn&#8217;t do much school. I had a lot of catching up to do if I was going to hang with the super-science
types.) I always thought the uncertainty principle had something to do with observing, how just the act of looking at something changed its nature, but apparently that&#8217;s a whole different thing, called the observer effect. That&#8217;s the kind of confusion you get when your grasp of physics comes from made-for-TV science fiction movies named after the monster that eats the boyfriend in the second act. I wasn&#8217;t too clear on the implications of the uncertainty principle, but I understood the observer effect. Me and the boys observed things all the time &#8212; Eye-Oh observed _everything_ all the time &#8212; and we sure as hell changed what we saw if we thought it needed changing.
&#8220;In cultures where many people live in the same house, or otherwise in close quarters, they develop coping mechanisms to deal with the lack of privacy,&#8221; the Liberator said. &#8220;They are capable not just of ignoring one another, but of genuinely _not noticing_ certain actions or behaviors of a personal and intimate nature. If everyone in the world could see everyone else, at will, we would all surely develop those same skills, do you see? Selective blindness for the greater social good.&#8221;
&#8220;Sure, sure,&#8221; I said, and turned a page.
&#8220;But for now it&#8217;s one-way. We can watch ordinary people, and see them[...]</itunes:summary>

This is how I find out that I&#8217;m pregnant:
I wake up to find Carter standing next to my bed. The fire escape door is open behind him, so the rising sun silhouettes his body. A human silhouette, albeit a little crisper than it should be, as his body bends the light towards him, powering up. Always powering up.
&#8220;You&#8217;re pregnant,&#8221; he says. No particular emphasis on the words, which is as per usual, his voice being run through vocal cords that are not human, formed by lips that have blown hurricanes off course. It&#8217;s not that he doesn&#8217;t feel emotion, he tells me and anyone else who&#8217;ll listen. It&#8217;s just that he doesn&#8217;t have the same biologically hardwired ways of showing it. Usually I believe him.
&#8220;What?&#8221; I rub my eyes, push up on one elbow. &#8220;That&#8217;s not possible.&#8221;
He leans over me, and touches my stomach. &#8220;I was flying by your apartment, thinking about you. I heard the heartbeat.&#8221;
&#8220;You told me that was impossible,&#8221; I say.
He frowns and asks, &#8220;I told you it was impossible for me to hear the . . .&#8221;
&#8220;Conceiving, Carter,&#8221; I say. &#8220;You told me it was impossible for us to conceive.&#8221;
&#8220;I thought it was. I was wrong.&#8221; His frown deepens. &#8220;I could take care of it for you right now if you want.&#8221;
I push Carter away from me and sit up. &#8220;For me, Carter?! You mean for us, right?&#8221;
&#8220;Right. That&#8217;s what I meant.&#8221; A pause, then. &#8220;You&#8217;re freezing the bed, Margaret.&#8221;
I glance down. Damn it. I&#8217;ve covered myself and the bed with a thin layer of ice. I take a deep breath and try to calm down before I do any permanent damage to my bed.
It strikes me that this whole thing smells of Dr. U. &#8220;Any idea where Dr. U is these days?&#8221; I say.
Carter shakes his head. &#8220;Ambrosius is reformed. This isn&#8217;t one of his plots, Margaret. You—we—have to decide what we&#8217;re going to do.&#8221; He winces. &#8220;Shoot. Bank robbery in Chicago. I have to go.&#8221;
He&#8217;s gone before I can respond.
&#8220;I should never date other supers,&#8221; I say, not for the first time. I put my hand on my stomach. Crap. I can barely keep a spider plant alive. There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m ready to be a mother.
I look back at the bed and wave my hand at it, heating the molecules surrounding it until the sheets are dry and warm. Then I call in sick to my norm-identity job at the advertising firm, and get back into bed. Of course I can&#8217;t sleep.
After an hour of lying in bed, I get up and spend what&#8217;s left of the morning surfing the Internet for information on pregnancy. My Battalion cell phone rings a few times, but I don&#8217;t pick up. A few minutes before noon, I hear a tap on the window behind me and find Carter is hovering outside. &#8220;Come on in,&#8221; I say.
A blur as he detours through the fire escape door in my bedroom and into my apartment. I know. It&#8217;s weird—he lets himself in while I&#8217;m asleep, but if I&#8217;m awake, he&#8217;ll always wait until I invite him in.
He runs his hands through his hair. &#8220;Why weren&#8217;t you answering the phone?&#8221;
I roll my eyes. If he wants, Carter can fly faster than the signal on a phone. &#8220;What, did the bank robbery in Chicago hold you up?&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s a tough conversation. I thought it might be easier for you to have it from a distance.&#8221;
&#8220;Easier for me?&#8221; I briefly consider incinerating Carter&#8217;s costume. I&#8217;m pretty sure I could keep the heat contained, but if I&#8217;m wrong I&#8217;ll end up having to evacuate the building and pay the fire damages. Again. Still, I&#8217;m thinking it might be wor[...]</itunes:summary>

Nemesis
by Nathaniel Lee
It was the middle of second-period Spanish when I felt my cell phone go off in my pocket.  Three pulses, then two.  That meant one of my alerts had hit paydirt.  I&#8217;ve got newsfeeds filtered for keywords, pairing &#8220;emergency&#8221; and the names of every local school and business I could think of, plus I got Kenny from sixth period computer Science to cobble together a kind of hack on the actual first responders&#8217; radio channels.  If my phone had gone off, then there was trouble. 
If there was trouble, then the city needed Atom Boy.
So where was he?
Well, if I was in Spanish, then he was in History.  No, wait, he&#8217;d dropped the AP course.  Did he have some kind of math now instead?  Crud.  I had no idea.  I&#8217;d lost our hero.
&#8220;Miss Ramsey?&#8221;
&#8220;Ahem!&#8221;
&#8220;Uh, um, I mean, uh, Señora Ramsey?&#8221;
&#8221; Sí, Quentin?&#8221;
&#8220;Yo, uh, yo poder uso el baño?&#8221;
&#8220;Puedo.  Y sí, se puede.  Andale.&#8221;
I clapped a hand over my pocket to keep my phone-bulge hidden and ran out of the classroom, careful to turn to the right as if I were heading for the boy&#8217;s room.  A couple of months ago, that wouldn&#8217;t have been a bad idea; I&#8217;d discovered Adam&#8217;s secret when I walked in on him trying to get out of his tights at the end of fourth period.  Which he&#8217;d missed, by the way, and I&#8217;d had to cover for him and pretend like I&#8217;d gotten a text from his mom about an emergency dental appointment.
Nowadays, I made him use the locked room in the old elementary school building, next door to the art room.  I had a key because Mr. Adelaide trusted me to use it only to work on my project.  I felt bad about abusing that trust, but I figure helping a superhero save the world every week counts as some sort of civic duty.  I checked there first.
Adam was sitting at one of the old desks, his feet sticking out about a mile because it was designed for five-year-olds.  He had his suit half on.  His pale chest was bare, exposing those three wispy little curls that he was so proud of.  He didn&#8217;t look up when I came in. 
&#8220;Adam?  What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;ve lost my powers.&#8221;  His voice was dull, his eyes unfocused.  He sounded grim and deadly serious.
&#8220;Oh, for crying out loud, Adam, we&#8217;ve been over this.  Remember, last month?  You thought it was some kind of lingering effect from the Recluse&#8217;s poison bite, but it was all psychosoma-whosit.&#8221;  I ran in and snatched up his backpack, rummaging for his pill-box.  &#8220;Have you been taking your Paxil?&#8221;
&#8220;It made me gassy.  I&#8217;m on a new one now.  Starts with an &#8216;s,&#8217; I think.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, whatever it is, have you been taking it?&#8221;
&#8220;No!  I want to be me, not what some drug makes me.&#8221;
I resisted the urge to punch him.  It would be like hitting a steel wall, anyway.  Instead, I found the box and opened it.  The previous week&#8217;s pills were all still in their slots.  White pills, red pills, blue pills.  Patriotic.  &#8220;Which one is it?&#8221;
Adam shrugged.
&#8220;Argh!&#8221;  I pulled out one of each, thought about it, then made it two of each.  He had superpowers.  He could take it.  &#8220;Here.  Take these and get a move on.&#8221;
Adam picked the pills up.  &#8220;I told you, I lost my powers.&#8221;
&#8220;You did not.&#8221;
&#8220;Did so.&#8221;
I glared at him.  This called for drastic measures.  I turned, picked up a wooden dowel from the supply table, closed my eyes, and whacked him over the head.  I used my right hand this time; my left is my drawing hand, and I didn&#8217;t want to lose it for two weeks.  The actinic flash was blinding even through my eyel[...]</itunes:summary>

&#8220;You&#8217;re too restless,&#8221; the lizard whispered into my brain.
&#8220;And you&#8217;ve been at the reactor fuel again.&#8221;
Marla slapped her prehensile tail onto the table, cracking its surface with her paralysing stinger and rattling the chess pieces. The blow echoed through the control room.
&#8220;I hate it when you do that, Steven.&#8221;
&#8220;Do what?&#8221;
&#8220;Think you can read me.&#8221;
I smiled. &#8220;Your underarm scales are pale, which means a supercharged diet or zero-gravity. As we haven&#8217;t been off-planet, it must be the
food. Plus, your breath stinks of sulphur and your claws have white rings.&#8221;
Marla pointed one crimson eye at the table, but kept the other on me.
&#8220;Your move,” she said.
&#8220;Give me time. Why do you think I&#8217;m restless?&#8221;
&#8220;Because you&#8217;ve spent the last three weeks researching Loris, and done each patrol fully armed.&#8221;
I glanced through the window, as if by chance I might catch our thief creeping up in plain view, but all I saw were two huge moons glowering over the ruined planet, its civilisation long-dead, part-excavated and full of secrets.
I couldn&#8217;t let Marla know the site had me spooked, though. Her people had been hunters for a thousand years, and, through a quirk of fate, she believed in me.
&#8220;Right.&#8221; I said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s patrol.&#8221; I got most of the way to the door before I realised what the click behind me had meant. &#8220;And you can put that piece back.&#8221;
&#8220;Damn,&#8221; Marla said.
The night was darker than usual, but I left off my flashlight and navigated by the excavation&#8217;s amber glow. After two months I&#8217;d learned
the drill pretty well: walk three steps from the door before turning right, drop down through the first causeway, crunch my way over rubble and calcified ferns, pass beside three thousand year old shop windows, then into what people said were the temples of the spider-creatures that had once ruled Artemis.
As I walked, Marla leapt from one wall to another like a shooting star. She looked beautiful, her scales shining like jewels.
&#8220;Why you care so much about an urban legend?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;Because he&#8217;s a mystery. For two hundred years, Loris has been stealing artifacts, leaving only the letter L engraved onto the wall. Who wouldn&#8217;t be interested?&#8221;
&#8220;He&#8217;s only human, Steven.&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure. We didn&#8217;t have the technology to grow new bodies two centuries ago, so if he&#8217;s human, how has he lived so long?&#8221;
Marla was silent for a while, then she said, &#8220;however good he is, I bet you&#8217;re better.&#8221;
I walked away, unhappy with false praise. Instead, I ducked through the first arch, and stepped out below the huge, half-buried alien
machine. Next to it, the laboratories and excavating machines looked forlorn and tiny. Forty archaeologists worked here in Artemis&#8217; summer, but none had yet figured out what the machine did.
&#8220;Perhaps you regret our melding?&#8221; Marla whispered, her voice quavering.
&#8220;Not for a moment.&#8221;
&#8220;Then why do you seek out complications?&#8221;
&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;
&#8220;Loris, for instance. He&#8217;s just another hunt. So —&#8221;
&#8220;— Marla?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes?&#8221;
&#8220;The machine&#8217;s active.&#8221;
She appeared at my shoulder, scuttled up to the machine and crouched, eyes twitching in different directions. What had previously been a
mountain of dark metal now held a tiny panel that shimmered like oil on water. As we watched, it faded to black.
&#8220;Intriguing,&#8221; Marla said.
&#8220;Still think Loris is a myth?&#8221;
&#8220;I think we need to be careful.&#8221;
She left in a blur, dancin[...]</itunes:summary>

Hawksbill Station
by Robert Silverberg
Barrett was the uncrowned King of Hawksbill Station. He had been there the longest; he had suffered the most; he had the deepest inner resources of strength. Before his accident, he had been able to whip any man in the place. Now he was a cripple, but he still had that aura of power that gave him command. When there were problems at the Station, they were brought to Barrett. That was axiomatic. He was the king.
He ruled over quite a kingdom, too. In effect it was the whole world, pole to pole, meridian to meridian. For what it was worth. It wasn’t worth very much.
Now it was raining again. Barrett shrugged himself to his feet in the quick, easy gesture that cost him an infinite amount of carefully concealed agony, and shuffled to the door of his hut. Rain made him impatient:. the pounding of those great greasy drops against the corrugated tin roof was enough even to drive a Jim Barrett loony. He nudged the door open. Standing in the doorway, Barrett looked out over his kingdom.
Barren rock, nearly to the horizon. A shield of raw dolomite going on and on. Raindrops danced and bounced on that continental slab of rock. No trees. No grass. Behind Barrett’s hut lay the sea, gray and vast. The sky was gray too, even when it wasn’t raining.
He hobbled out into the rain. Manipulating his crutch was getting to be a simple matter for him now. He leaned comfortably, letting his crushed left foot dangle. A rockslide had pinned him last year during a trip to the edge of the Inland Sea. Back home, Barrett would have been fitted with prosthetics and that would have been the end of it: a new ankle, a new instep, refurbished ligaments and tendons. But home was a billion years away, and home there’s no returning.
The rain hit him hard. Barrett was a big man, six and a half feet tall, with hooded dark eyes, a jutting nose, a chin that was a monarch among chins. He had weighed two hundred fifty pounds in his prime, in the good old agitating days when he had carried banners and pounded out manifestos. But now he was past sixty and beginning to shrink a little, the skin getting loose around the places where the mighty muscles used to be. It was hard to keep your weight in Hawksbill Station. The food was nutritious, but it lacked intensity. A man got to miss steak. Eating brachiopod stew and trilobite hash wasn’t the same thing at all. Barrett was past all bitterness, though. That was another reason why the men regarded him as the leader. He didn’t scowl. He didn’t rant. He was resigned to his fate, tolerant of eternal exile, and so he could help the others get over that difficult, heart-clawing period of transition.
A figure arrived, jogging through the rain: Norton. The doctrinaire Khrushchevist with the Trotskyite leanings. A small, excitable man who frequently appointed himself messenger whenever there was news at the Station. He sprinted toward Barrett’s hut, slipping and sliding over the naked rocks.
Barrett held up a meaty hand. “Whoa, Charley. Take it easy or you’ll break your neck!”
Norton halted in front of the hut. The rain had pasted the widely spaced strands of his brown hair to his skull. His eyes had the fixed, glossy look of fanaticism—or perhaps just astigmatism. He gasped for breath and staggered into the hut, shaking himself like a wet puppy. He obviously had run all the way from the main building of the Station, three hundred yards away—a long dash over rock that slippery.
“Why are you standing around in the rain?” Norton asked.
“To get wet,” said Barrett, following him inside. “What’s the news?”
“The Hammer’s glowing. We’re getting company.”
“How do you know it’s a live shipment?”
“It’s been glowing for half an hour. That means they’re taking precautions. They’re sending a new prisoner. Anyway, no supplies[...]</itunes:summary>

 The Paper Menagerie
by Ken Liu
One of my earliest memories starts with me sobbing. I refused to be soothed no matter what Mom and Dad tried.
Dad gave up and left the bedroom, but Mom took me into the kitchen and sat me down at the breakfast table.
&#8220;Kan, kan,&#8221; she said, as she pulled a sheet of wrapping paper from on top of the fridge. For years, Mom carefully sliced open the wrappings around Christmas gifts and saved them on top of the fridge in a thick stack.
She set the paper down, plain side facing up, and began to fold it. I stopped crying and watched her, curious.
She turned the paper over and folded it again. She pleated, packed, tucked, rolled, and twisted until the paper disappeared between her cupped hands. Then she lifted the folded-up paper packet to her mouth and blew into it, like a balloon.
&#8220;Kan,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Laohu.&#8221; She put her hands down on the table and let go.
A little paper tiger stood on the table, the size of two fists placed together. The skin of the tiger was the pattern on the wrapping paper, white background with red candy canes and green Christmas trees.
I reached out to Mom’s creation. Its tail twitched, and it pounced playfully at my finger. &#8220;Rawrr-sa,&#8221; it growled, the sound somewhere between a cat and rustling newspapers.
I laughed, startled, and stroked its back with an index finger. The paper tiger vibrated under my finger, purring.
&#8220;Zhe jiao zhezhi,&#8221; Mom said. This is called origami.
I didn’t know this at the time, but Mom&#8217;s kind was special. She breathed into them so that they shared her breath, and thus moved with her life. This was her magic.
#
Dad had picked Mom out of a catalog.
One time, when I was in high school, I asked Dad about the details. He was trying to get me to speak to Mom again.
He had signed up for the introduction service back in the spring of 1973. Flipping through the pages steadily, he had spent no more than a few seconds on each page until he saw the picture of Mom.
I&#8217;ve never seen this picture. Dad described it: Mom was sitting in a chair, her side to the camera, wearing a tight green silk cheongsam. Her head was turned to the camera so that her long black hair was draped artfully over her chest and shoulder. She looked out at him with the eyes of a calm child.
&#8220;That was the last page of the catalog I saw,&#8221; he said.
The catalog said she was eighteen, loved to dance, and spoke good English because she was from Hong Kong. None of these facts turned out to be true.
He wrote to her, and the company passed their messages back and forth. Finally, he flew to Hong Kong to meet her.
&#8220;The people at the company had been writing her responses. She didn&#8217;t know any English other than &#8216;hello&#8217; and &#8216;goodbye.&#8217;&#8221;
What kind of woman puts herself into a catalog so that she can be bought? The high school me thought I knew so much about everything. Contempt felt good, like wine.
Instead of storming into the office to demand his money back, he paid a waitress at the hotel restaurant to translate for them.
&#8220;She would look at me, her eyes halfway between scared and hopeful, while I spoke. And when the girl began translating what I said, she&#8217;d start to smile slowly.&#8221;
He flew back to Connecticut and began to apply for the papers for her to come to him. I was born a year later, in the Year of the Tiger.
#
At my request, Mom also made a goat, a deer, and a water buffalo out of wrapping paper. They would run around the living room while Laohu chased after them, growling. When he caught them he would press down until the air went out of them and they became just flat, folded-up pieces of paper. I would then have to blow into them to re-inflate them so they could r[...]</itunes:summary>

Movement
By Nancy Fulda
It is sunset.  The sky is splendid through the panes of my bedroom window; billowing layers of cumulous blazing with refracted oranges and reds.  I think if only it weren’t for the glass, I could reach out and touch the cloudscape, perhaps leave my own trail of turbulence in the swirling patterns that will soon deepen to indigo.
But the window is there, and I feel trapped.
Behind me my parents and a specialist from the neurological research institute are sitting on folding chairs they’ve brought in from the kitchen, quietly discussing my future.  They do not know I am listening.  They think that, because I do not choose to respond,  I do not notice they are there.
“Would there be side effects?” My father asks.  In the oppressive heat of the evening, I hear the quiet Zzzapof his shoulder laser as it targets mosquitoes.  The device is not as effective as it was two years ago: the mosquitoes are getting faster.
My father is a believer in technology, and that is why he contacted the research institute.  He wants to fix me.  He is certain there is a way.
“There would be no side effects in the traditional sense,”the specialist says.  I like him even though his presence makes me uncomfortable.  He chooses his words very precisely.  “We’re talking about direct synaptic grafting, not drugs.  The process is akin to bending a sapling to influence the shape of the grown tree.  We boost the strength of key dendritic connections and allow brain development to continue naturally. Young neurons are very malleable.”
“And you’ve done this before?”  I do not have to look to know my mother is frowning.
My mother does not trust technology.  She has spent the last ten years trying to coax me into social behavior by gentler means.  She loves me, but she does not understand me.  She thinks I cannot be happy unless I am smiling and laughing and running along the beach with other teenagers.
“The procedure is still new, but our first subject was a young woman about the same age as your daughter.  Afterwards, she integrated wonderfully.  She was never an exceptional student, but she began speaking more and had an easier time following classroom procedure.”
“What about Hannah’s&#8230;talents?”my mother asks.  I know she is thinking about my dancing; also the way I remember facts and numbers without trying. “Would she lose those?”
The specialist’s voice is very firm, and I like the way he delivers the facts without trying to cushion them.  “It’s a matter of trade-offs, Mrs. Didier.  The brain cannot be optimized for everything at once.  Without treatment, some children like Hannah develop into extraordinary individuals. They become famous, change the world, learn to integrate their abilities into the structures of society.  But only a very few are that lucky. The others never learn to make friends, hold a job, or live outside of institutions.”
“And&#8230; with treatment?”
“I cannot promise anything, but the chances are very good that Hannah will lead a normal life.”
I have pressed my hand to the window.  The glass feels cold and smooth beneath my palm.  It appears motionless although I know at the molecular level it is flowing.  Its atoms slide past each other slowly, so slowly; a transformation no less inevitable for its tempo.  I like glass &#8212; also stone &#8212; because it does not change very quickly.  I will be dead, and so will all of my relatives and their descendants, before the deformations will be visible without a microscope.
I feel my mother’s hands on my shoulders.  She has come up behind me and now she turns me so that I must either look in her eyes or pull away.  I lo[...]</itunes:summary>

by Mike Resnick
I don’t know which bothers me more, my lumbago or my arthritis. One day it’s one, one day it’s the other. They can cure cancer and transplant every damned organ in your body; you’d think they could find some way to get rid of aches and pains. Let me tell you, growing old isn’t for sissies.
I remember that I was having a typical dream. Well, typical for me, anyway. I was climbing the four steps to my front porch, only when I got to the third step there were six more, so I climbed them and then there were ten more, and it went on and on. I’d probably still be climbing them if the creature hadn’t woke me up.
It stood next to my bed, staring down at me. I blinked a couple of times, trying to focus my eyes, and stared back, sure this was just an extension of my dream.
It was maybe six feet tall, its skin a glistening, almost metallic silver, with multi-faceted bright red eyes like an insect. Its ears were pointed and batlike, and moved independently of its head and each other. Its mouth jutted out a couple of inches like some kind of tube, and looked like it was only good for sucking fluids. Its arms were slender, with no hint of the muscles required to move them, and its fingers were thin and incredibly elongated. It was as weird a nightmare figure as I’d dreamed up in years.
Finally it spoke, in a voice that sounded more like a set of chimes than anything else.
“Hello, Dad,” it said.
That’s when I knew I was awake.
“So this is what you look like,” I growled, swinging my feet over the side of the bed and sitting up. “What the hell are you doing here?”
“I’m glad to see you too,” he replied.
“You didn’t answer my question,” I said, feeling around for my slippers.
“I heard about Mom – not from you, of course – and I wanted to see her once more before the end.”
“Can you see through those things?” I asked, indicating his eyes.
“Better than you can.”
Big surprise. Hell, everyone can see better than I can.
“How did you get in here anyway?” I said as I got to my feet. The furnace was as old and tired as I was and there was a chill in the air, so I put on my robe.
“You haven’t changed the front door’s code words since I left.” He looked around the room. “You haven’t painted the place either.”
“The lock’s supposed to check your retinagram or read your DNA or something.”
“It did. They haven’t changed.”
I looked him up and down. “The hell they haven’t.”
He seemed about to reply, then thought better of it. Finally he said, “How is she?”
“She has her bad days and her worse days,” I answered. “She’s the old Julia maybe two or three times a week for a minute or two, but that’s all. She can still speak, and she still recognizes me.” I paused. “She won’t recognize you, of course, but nobody else you ever knew will either.”
“How long has she been like this?”
“Maybe a year.”
“You should have told me,” he said.
“Why?” I asked. “You gave up being her son and became whatever it is you are now.”
“I’m still her son, and you had my contact information.”
I stared at him. “Well, you’re not my son, not anymore.”
“I’m sorry you feel that way,” he replied. Suddenly he sniffed the air. “It smells stale.”
“Tired old houses are like tired old men,” I said. “They don’t function on all cylinders.”
“You could move to a smaller, newer place.”
“This house and me, we’ve grown old together. Not everyone wants to move to Alpha whatever-the-hell-it-is.”
He looked around. “Where is she?”
“In your old room,” I said.
He turned, walked out into the hall. “Haven’t you replaced that thing yet?” he asked, indicating an old wall table. “It was scarred and wobbly when I still lived here.”
“It’s just a table. It holds whatever I put on it. That’s all it has to do.”
He looked up at the ceiling. “The paint’s peeling too.”
“I’m too old to do it myself, and painters cost mon[...]</itunes:summary>

The Cartographer Wasps and the Anarchist Bees
By E. Lily Yu
For longer than anyone could remember, the village of Yiwei had worn, in its orchards and under its eaves, clay-colored globes of paper that hissed and fizzed with wasps. The villagers maintained an uneasy peace with their neighbors for many years, exercising inimitable tact and circumspection. But it all ended the day a boy, digging in the riverbed, found a stone whose balance and weight pleased him. With this, he thought, he could hit a sparrow in flight. There were no sparrows to be seen, but a paper ball hung low and inviting nearby. He considered it for a moment, head cocked, then aimed and threw.
Much later, after he had been plastered and soothed, his mother scalded the fallen nest until the wasps seething in the paper were dead. In this way it was discovered that the wasp nests of Yiwei, dipped in hot water, unfurled into beautifully accurate maps of provinces near and far, inked in vegetable pigments and labeled in careful Mandarin that could be distinguished beneath a microscope.
The villagers&#8217; subsequent incursions with bee veils and kettles of boiling water soon diminished the prosperous population to a handful. Commanded by a single stubborn foundress, the survivors folded a new nest in the shape of a paper boat, provisioned it with fallen apricots and squash blossoms, and launched themselves onto the river. Browsing cows and children fled the riverbanks as they drifted downstream, piping sea chanteys.
At last, forty miles south from where they had begun, their craft snagged on an upthrust stick and sank. Only one drowned in the evacuation, weighed down with the remains of an apricot. They reconvened upon a stump and looked about themselves.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a good place to land,&#8221; the foundress said in her sweet soprano, examining the first rough maps that the scouts brought back. There were plenty of caterpillars, oaks for ink galls, fruiting brambles, and no signs of other wasps. A colony of bees had hived in a split oak two miles away. &#8220;Once we are established we will, of course, send a delegation to collect tribute.
&#8220;We will not make the same mistakes as before. Ours is a race of explorers and scientists, cartographers and philosophers, and to rest and grow slothful is to die. Once we are established here, we will expand.&#8221;
It took two weeks to complete the nurseries with their paper mobiles, and then another month to reconstruct the Great Library and fill the pigeonholes with what the oldest cartographers could remember of their lost maps. Their comings and goings did not go unnoticed. An ambassador from the beehive arrived with an ultimatum and was promptly executed; her wings were made into stained-glass windows for the council chamber, and her stinger was returned to the hive in a paper envelope. The second ambassador came with altered attitude and a proposal to divide the bees&#8217; kingdom evenly between the two governments, retaining pollen and water rights for the bees—&#8221;as an acknowledgment of the preexisting claims of a free people to the natural resources of a common territory,&#8221; she hummed.
The wasps of the council were gracious and only divested the envoy of her sting. She survived just long enough to deliver her account to the hive.
The third ambassador arrived with a ball of wax on the tip of her stinger and was better received.
&#8220;You understand, we are not refugees applying for recognition of a token territorial sovereignty,&#8221; the foundress said, as attendants served them nectars in paper horns, &#8220;nor are we negotiating with you as equal states. Those were the assumptions of your late predecessors. They were mistaken.&#8221;
&#8220;I trust I will do better,&#8221; the diplomat said stiffly. She was older than[...]</itunes:summary>

Certus per Bellum (Decided by War)
By S. Hutson Blount
&#8220;It&#8217;s quiet outside,&#8221; Nohaile said, trying to find a comfortable way to sit in his armor suit. &#8220;Are you sure it&#8217;s started?&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;ll get plenty loud,&#8221; said the girl. She was armored only in a ratty sweatshirt and a patched bib coverall. She&#8217;d entered the bunker
with a vest and some sensible-looking boots, but promptly removed them. Her bare feet made her look about twelve years old. &#8220;For right
now,&#8221; she continued after some rapid two-thumb typing on her hand console, &#8220;we got time to kill.&#8221;
&#8220;Miz Bamboo, do you think we can win?&#8221; Nohaile had a matching helmet to go with his armor. He felt foolish either leaving it off or putting it on, so it worried in his hands.
The girl laughed a little. It didn&#8217;t reach her eyes. &#8220;There&#8217;s no &#8216;miz.&#8217; Bamboo is my handle, not my name.&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;
&#8220;No worries. And yeah, we can win. The other guy hired cheap.&#8221;
Bamboo kept looking at the display on her console, checking through her seemingly-infinite pockets and producing unidentifiable items to
inspect and disappear again. Everything she carried seemed dirty but functional.
Nohaile looked down at his shiny armor suit and was ashamed.
&#8220;So, when do I get the story?&#8221; Bamboo asked.
&#8220;I thought you said you didn&#8217;t care about the circumstances of the lawsuit.&#8221; She&#8217;d been very clear on that point. Rude, even.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t. But every client has to tell. You care enough about whatever this disagreement is to put your ass on the line. You might as well get it over with.&#8221;
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to burden you while you&#8217;re…&#8221; He gestured at her control pad, blinking and murmuring to itself on the concrete floor beside
her.
She&#8217;d produced a handgun hidden somewhere in that shapeless coverall, a considerable-looking piece of artillery. To Nohaile&#8217;s inexperienced eyes, it looked like it would break her wrists if fired.
Bamboo stopped disassembling it and looked at him more pointedly. &#8220;Where did you say you were from, again?&#8221;
&#8220;Baltimore,&#8221; Nohaile said. &#8220;Before that, Dire Dawa. In Ethiopia,&#8221; he added, because he knew he would have to.
&#8220;They grow &#8216;em polite in Ethiopia, I guess. Burden away. When something happens, I promise I&#8217;ll take care of it.&#8221; She grinned at him, freckles behind straw-colored bangs.
Nohaile set his streamlined, buglike helmet beside him. &#8220;It was a patent infringement case. Originally, I mean. I had tried to interest
VesterDyne in my extrusion bearing process. Shortly after the first round of presentations, they cancelled the exploratory contract. They said they&#8217;d found another source with a similar product. I knew it couldn&#8217;t be similar, I had a patent.&#8221;
Bamboo test-fit[...]</itunes:summary>

Aphrodisia
By Lavie Tidhar

It began, in a way, with the midget hunchback tuk-tuk driver.

It was a night in the cool season&#8230;

The stars shone like cold hard semi-precious stones overhead. Shadows moved across the face of the moon. The beer place was emptying –

Ban Watnak where fat mosquitoes buzzed, lazily, across neon-lit faces. Thai pop playing too loudly, cigarette smoke rising the remnants of ghosts, straining to escape Earth’s atmosphere.

In the sky flying lanterns looked like tracer bullets, like fireflies. The midget hunchback tuk-tuk driver said, ‘Where are you going -?’ mainlining street speed and ancient wisdom.

Tone: ‘Where are you going?’

The driver sat on the elevated throne of his vehicle and contemplated the question as if his life depended on it. ‘Over there,’ he said, gesturing. Then, grudgingly – ‘Not far.’

But it was far enough for us.

Tone and Bejesus and me made three: Tone with the hafmek body, all spray-painted metal chest and arms, Victorian-style goggles hiding his eyes, a scarf in the colours of a vanished football team around his neck – it was cold. It was Earth cold, not real – there was no dial you could turn to make it go away. Bejesus not speaking, a fragile low-gravity body writhing with nervous energy despite the unaccustomed weight – Bejesus in love with this planet Earth, a long way away from his rock home in space.

Tone, in Asteroid Pidgin: ‘Yumi go lukaotem ol gel.’

‘No girls,’ I said. Tone smirked. Bejesus danced on the spot, nervous, excited, it was hard to tell. Tone said: ‘Boy, girl, all same.’

Bejesus, to the driver: ‘I dig your body work, man.’

Tone shaking his head. ‘Dumb ignorant rock-worm,’ he said, but with affection.

The hunchback midget tuk-tuk driver grinned, said, ‘You come with me, no pay. Free tuk-tuk!’

‘Best offer we’re going to get,’ Tone said, and I nodded. Bejesus passed me a pill. I dry-swallowed. The floating lanterns seemed larger then, like warm eyes blinking high above. ‘Let’s go!’ I said. My heart was beating too fast. ‘Hungry and horny and a long way from home,’ Tone said – a bad poet in hafmek armour.

We went.
 #

Piled at the back of a solar-powered tuk-tuk at night, Aphrodisia tunes blaring out, blurring my careful composure – Aphrodisia, the Upload Deity, queen of no-space – Aphrodisia who loved me and fucked me and sang to me and left me – left everything and everyone behind. She was everywhere now, goddess bitch, and I cried and the tears were multicoloured in rust and acid-rain. Bejesus, the tentacle-junkie, wrapped his arms around me, and even Tone patted me on the back, there, there, awkwardly.

I shrugged them off. Nest-brothers, we shared a hub in Tong Yun City years before, the asteroid-worm and the orbital hafmek and me – shared food and drugs and sex and minds – but we were younger then, on Mars.

Earth is different to anything you can imagine.

Golubash (Wine-Blood-War-Story)
by Catherynne M. Valente
The difficulties of transporting wine over interstellar distances are manifold. Wine is, after all, like a child. It can _bruise_. It can suffer trauma—sometimes the poor creature can recover, sometimes it must be locked up in a cellar until it learns to behave itself. Sometimes it is irredeemable. I ask that you greet the seven glasses before you tonight not as simple fermented grapes, but as the living creatures they are, well-brought up, indulged but not coddled, punished when necessary, shyly seeking your approval with clasped hands and slicked hair. After all, they have come so very far for the chance to be loved.
Welcome to the first public tasting of Domaine Zhaba. My name is Phylloxera Nanut, and it is the fruit of my family’s vines that sits before you. Please forgive our humble venue—surely we could have wished for something grander than a scorched pre-war orbital platform, but circumstances, and the constant surveillance of Chatêau Marubouzu-Debrouillard and their soldiers have driven us to extremity. Mind the loose electrical panels and pull up a reactor husk—they are inert, I assure you. Spit onto the floor—a few new stains will never be noticed. As every drop about to pass your lips is wholly, thoroughly, enthusiastically illegal, we shall not stand on ceremony. Shall we begin?
2583 Sud-Cotê-du-Golubash (New Danube)
The colonial ship _Quintessence of Dust_ first blazed across the skies of Avalokitesvara two hundred years before I was born, under the red stare of Barnard’s Star, our second solar benefactor. Her plasma sails streamed kilometers long, like sheltering wings. Simone Nanut was on that ship. She, alongside a thousand others, looked down on their new home from  that great height, the single long, unfathomably wide river that circumscribed the globe, the golden mountains prickled with cobalt alders, the deserts streaked with pink salt.
How I remember the southern coast of Golubash, I played there, and dreamed there was a girl on the invisible opposite shore, and that her family, too, made wine and cowered like us in the shadow of the Asociación.
My friends, in your university days did you not study the rolls of the first colonials, did you not memorize their weight-limited cargo, verse after verse of spinning wheels, bamboo seeds, lathes, vials of tailored bacteria, as holy writ? Then perhaps you will recall Simone Nanut and her folly, that her pitiful allotment of cargo was taken up by the clothes on her back and a tangle of ancient Maribor grapevine, its roots tenderly wrapped and watered. Mad Slovak witch they all thought her, patting those tortured, battered vines into the gritty yellow soil of the Golubash basin. Even the Hyphens were sure the poor things would fail. There were only four of them on all of Avalokitesvara, immensely tall, their watery triune faces catching the old red light of Barnard’s flares, their innumerable arms fanned out around their terribly thin torsos like peacock’s tails. Not for nothing was the planet named for a Hindu god with eleven faces and a thousand arms. The colonists called them Hyphens for their way of talking, and for the thinness of their bodies. They did not understand then what you must all know now, rolling your eyes behind your sleeves as your hostess relates ancient history, that each of the four Hyphens was a quarter of the world in a single body, that they were a mere outcropping of the vast intelligences which made up the ecology of Avalokitesvara, like one of our thumbs or a pair of lips.
Golubash I knew. To know more than one Hyphen in a lifetime is rare. Officially, the great river is still called the New Danube, but eventually my[...]</itunes:summary>

&#8220;Run,&#8221; Bakri Says
By Ferrett Steinmetz
&#8220;I just want to know where my brother is,&#8221; Irena yells at the guards.  The
English words are thick and slow on her tongue, like honey.  She holds her
hands high in the air; the gun she&#8217;s tucked into the back of her pants jabs
at her spine.
She doesn&#8217;t want to kill the soldiers on this iteration; she&#8217;s never killed
anyone before, and doesn&#8217;t want to start.  But unless she can get poor, weak
Sammi out of that prison in the next fifty/infinity minutes, they&#8217;ll start
in on him with the rubber hoses and he&#8217;ll tell them what he&#8217;s done.  And
though she loves her brother with all her heart, it would be a blessing then
if the Americans beat him to death.
The guards are still at the far end of the street, just before the tangle of
barbed wire that bars the prison entrance.  Irena stands still, lets them
approach her, guns out.  One is a black man, the skin around his eyes
creased with a habitual expression of distrust; a fringe of white hair and
an unwavering aim marks him as a career man.  The other is a younger man,
squinting nervously, his babyfat face the picture of every new American
soldier.  Above them, a third soldier looks down from his wooden tower,
reaching for the radio at his belt.
She hopes she won&#8217;t get to know them.  This will be easier if all they do is
point guns and yell.  It&#8217;ll be just like Sammi&#8217;s stupid videogames.
&#8220;My brother,&#8221; she repeats, her mouth dry; it hurts to raise her arms after
the rough surgery Bakri&#8217;s done with an X-acto knife and some fishing line.
&#8220;His name is Sammi Daraghmeh.  You rounded him up last night, with many
other men.  He is &#8211; &#8221;
Their gazes catch on the rough iron manacle dangling from her left wrist.
She looks up, remembers that Bakri installed a button on the tether so she
could rewind, realizes the front of her cornflower-blue abayah is splotched
with blood from her oozing stitches.
&#8220;Wait.&#8221; She backs away.  &#8220;I&#8217;m not &#8211; &#8221;
The younger soldier yells, &#8220;She&#8217;s got something!&#8221;  They open fire.
Something tugs at her neck, parting flesh; another crack, and she swallows
her own teeth.  She tries to talk but her windpipe whistles; her body
betrays her, refusing to move as she crumples to the ground, willing herself
to keep going.  Nothing listens.
This is death, she thinks.  This is what it&#8217;s like to die.
#
&#8220;Run,&#8221; Bakri says, and Irena is standing in an alleyway instead of dying on
the street &#8211; gravity&#8217;s all wrong and her muscles follow her orders again.
Her arms and legs flail and she topples face-first into a pile of rotting
lettuce.  The gun Bakri has just pressed into her hands falls to the ground.
Dying was worse than she&#8217;d thought.  Her mind&#8217;s still jangled with the
shock, from feeling all her nerves shrieking in panic as she died. She
shudders in the garbage, trying to regain strength.
Bakri picks her up.  &#8220;What is your goal?&#8221; he barks, keeping his voice low so
the shoppers at the other end of the grocery store&#8217;s alleyway don&#8217;t hear.
Why is he asking me that? she thinks, then remembers: all the others went
insane.  She wouldn&#8217;t even be here if Farhouz hadn&#8217;t slaughtered seventeen
soldiers inside the Green Zone.
It takes an effort to speak.  &#8220;To &#8211; to rescue Sammi.&#8221;
&#8220;Good.&#8221; The tension drains from his face.  He looks so relieved that Irena
thinks he might burst into tears.  &#8220;What iteration?  You did iterate,
right?&#8221;
&#8220;Two,&#8221; she says numbly, understanding what his relief means: he didn&#8217;t know.
He&#8217;d sent her off to be shot, unsure whether he[...]</itunes:summary>

 The girl was perfect. Her framing, the engine at her core, the intricate web of connections holding her objects together, built-in redundancies&#8230; Meroe had never seen such efficiency. The girl&#8217;s structure was simple because she didn&#8217;t need any of the shortcuts and workarounds that most of their kind required to function. There was no bloat to her, no junk code slowing her down, no patchy sores that left her vulnerable to infection.
&#8220;She&#8217;s a thing of beauty, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221; Faster said.
Meroe returned to interface view. He glanced at Zo and saw the same suspicion lurking in her beatific expression.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen anything like this,&#8221; Meroe said, watching Zo, speaking to Faster. &#8220;We don&#8217;t grow that way.&#8221;
&#8220;I know!&#8221; Faster was pacing, gesticulating, caught up in his own excitement. He didn&#8217;t notice Meroe&#8217;s look. &#8220;She must have evolved from something professionally-coded. Maybe even Government Standard. I didn&#8217;t think we could be born from that!&#8221;
They couldn&#8217;t. Meroe stared at the girl, not liking what he was seeing. The avatar was just too well-designed, too detailed. Her features and coloring matched that of some variety of Latina; probably Central or South American given the noticeable indigenous traits. Most of their kind created Caucasian avatars to start &#8212; a human minority who for some reason comprised the majority of images available for sampling in the Amorph. And most first avatars had bland, nondescript faces. This girl had clear features, right down to her distinctively-formed lips and chin &#8212; and hands. It had taken five versionings for Meroe to get his own hands right.
&#8220;Did you check out her feature-objects?&#8221; Faster asked, oblivious to Meroe&#8217;s unease.
&#8220;Why?&#8221;
Zo answered. &#8220;Two of them are standard add-ons &#8212; an aggressive defender and a diagnostic tool. The other two we can&#8217;t identify. Something new.&#8221; Her lips curved in a smile; she knew how he would react.

Counting Cracks
By George R. Galuschak
Four of us, jammed into my sister&#8217;s Ford Festiva, going to kill the monster. Sylvia drives. The Hum has left her untouched, so she&#8217;s the only one left in town who can drive. My sister licks the palm of her hand, touches it to her nose and bumps her forehead against the steering wheel. Then she does it again.
&#8220;Today would be nice, sis.&#8221; I say. I&#8217;m in the back seat with June, a twelve-year old girl clutching a teddy bear to her chest.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going as fast as I can,&#8221; she tells me. &#8220;It&#8217;s bad today.&#8221;
&#8220;The Shop-Rite has three hundred and fifty-seven ceiling tiles,&#8221; Michael tells me. He&#8217;s a little kid, nine years old, sitting up front with Sylvia. &#8220;I counted them.&#8221;
&#8220;Inpatient oranges creep handsome banisters,&#8221; June says, rolling her eyes.
&#8220;Good for you,&#8221; I say. My left leg hurts, which I guess is a good sign. My left arm feels like dead weight except for the tips of my fingers, which are tingly.
&#8220;Do you count tiles, Mr. Bruschi?&#8221; Michael asks.
&#8220;No. I counted cracks on the sidewalk. When I was a kid.&#8221;
A sparrow collides with the windshield. It bounces off and skitters to the pavement, where it thrashes. I haven&#8217;t seen a living bird in days. It must have flown into the Hum.
&#8220;Swill,&#8221; June says, pointing at the bird. &#8220;Maraschino cherries. Skittles. Cocktail weenies.&#8221;
&#8220;All right. I&#8217;m ready.&#8221; Sylvia twists the key, and the car starts. We back out of the driveway.
&#8220;The streets are so empty,&#8221; she says.
&#8220;That&#8217;s because everyone is dead,&#8221; Michael tells her. &#8220;They listened to the Hum and went into their houses and pulled the covers over their heads and died. I had a hamster that died, once. It got real old, so it made a little nest, and then it laid down in it and died.&#8221;
&#8220;We&#8217;re not dead,&#8221; I say.
&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; Michael corrects me. &#8220;Give it time.&#8221;
#
It started a week ago. Tuesday morning, hot day, storm clouds gathering like bad thoughts. I walked out to my car. I was going to work, the way normal people do. I&#8217;m not normal, but I&#8217;ve gotten good at pretending.
I saw a robin fluttering its wings on the sidewalk. At first I thought its back was broken, but when I came closer it squawked and ran onto the lawn. It gave a little hop, flapping its wings, and then hopped again.
I put my hands to my temples. My head hurt. I hadn&#8217;t slept well the night before, and I could feel the beginnings of a migraine forming. I looked at the robin, hopping and flapping its wings on my lawn. It didn&#8217;t look injured; it looked like it had forgotten how to fly.
I shrugged and walked away. The bird&#8217;s behavior was strange, but I needed to get to work. So I went. When I drove home that evening the sidewalks and streets were covered with birds, all squawking and flapping their wings.
The bird story made the nightly news. The newswoman stood in Buehler Park surrounded by a flock of distressed pigeons. She talked too loud and stumbled over her words. Her voice sounded a bit slurred, like she was drunk.
&#8220;Put something else on,&#8221; my wife said. We were eating dinner in front of the TV, the way we did when things were good between us.
&#8220;All right.&#8221; I shrugged and switched the channel. We watched a movie, and I forgot all about the birds.
The next morning my wife went blind.
#
We pull into Shop-Rite&#8217;s parking lot. Normally it&#8217;s jam-packed. They average three fender-benders a week, because the designers of the lot made the lanes too small, the spaces too tight. But today we drive right in.
&#8220;This is far enough[...]</itunes:summary>

The Speed of Time
by Jay Lake
&#8220;Light goes by at the speed of time,&#8221; Marlys once told me.
That was a joke, of course. Light can be slowed to a standstill in a photon trap, travel on going nowhere at all forever in the blueing distance of an event horizon, or blaze through hard vacuum as fast as information itself moves through the universe. Time is relentless, the tide which measures the perturbations of the cosmos. The 160.2 GHz hum of creation counts the measure of our lives as surely as any heartbeat.
There is no t in e=mc2.
I&#8217;d argued with her then, missing her point back when understanding her might have mattered. Now, well, nothing much at all mattered. Time has caught up with us all.
#
Let me tell you a story about Sameera Glasshouse.
She&#8217;d been an ordinary woman living an ordinary life. Habitat chemistry tech, certifications from several middle-tier authorities, bouncing from contract to contract in trans-Belt space. Ten thousand women, men and inters just like her out there during the Last Boom. We didn&#8217;t call it that then, no one knew the expansion curve the solar economy had been riding was the last of anything. The Last Boom didn&#8217;t really have a name when it was underway, except maybe to economists.
Sameera had been pair-bonded to a Jewish kid from Zion Luna, and kept the surname long after she&#8217;d dropped Roz from her life. For one thing, &#8220;Glasshouse&#8221; scandalized her Lebanese grandmother, which was a reward in itself.
She was working a double ticket on the Enceladus Project master depot, in low orbit around that particular iceball. That meant pulling shift-on-shift week after week, but Sameera got an expanded housing allocation and a fatter pay packet for her trouble. The E.P. got to schlep one less body to push green inside their habitat scrubbers. Everybody won.
Her spare time was spent wiring together Big Ears, to listen for the chatter that flooded bandwidth all over the solar system. Human beings are &#8212; were &#8212; noisy. Launch control, wayfinding, birthday greetings, telemetry, banking queries, loneliness, porn. It was all out there, multiplied and ramified beyond comprehension by the combination of lightspeed lag, language barriers and sheer, overwhelming complexity.
Some folks back then claimed there were emergent structures in the bandwidth, properties of the sum of all that chatter which could not be accounted for by analysis of the components. This sort of thinking had been going around since the dawn of information theory &#8212; call it information fantasy. The same hardwired pareidolia that made human beings see the hand of God in the empirical universe also made us hear Him in the electronic shrieking of our tribe.
Sameera never really believed any of it, but she&#8217;d heard some very weird things listening in. In space, it was always midnight, and ghosts never stopped playing in the bandwidth. When she&#8217;d picked up a crying child on a leaky sideband squirt out of a nominally empty vector, she&#8217;d just kept hopping frequencies. When she&#8217;d tuned on the irregular regularity of a coded data feed that seemed to originate from deep within Saturn&#8217;s atmosphere, she&#8217;d just kept hopping frequencies.
But one day God had called Sameera by name. Her voice crackled out of the rising fountain of energy from an extragalactic gamma ray burst, whispering the three syllables over and over and over in a voice which resonated down inside the soft tissues of Sameera&#8217;s body, made her joints ache, jellied the very resolve of the soul that she had not known she possessed until that exact moment.
Sameera Glasshouse shut down her Big Ears, wiped the logic blocks, dumped the memory, then made her way down to the master depot&#8217;s tiny sacramentarium.

The Water Man
by Ursula Pflug
The water man came today. I waited all morning, and then all afternoon, painting plastic soldiers to pass the time. Red paint too in the sky when he finally showed; I turned the outside lights on for him and held the door while he carried the big bottles in. He set them all in a row just inside the storm door; there wasn&#8217;t any other place to put them. When he was done he stood catching his breath, stamping his big boots to warm his feet. Melting snow made little muddy lakes on the linoleum. I dug in my jeans for money to tip him with, knowing I wouldn&#8217;t find any. Finally I just offered him water. 
We drank together. It was cool and clean and good, running down our throats in the dimness of the store. It made me feel wide and quiet, and I watched his big eyes poke around Synapses, checking us out, and while they did, mine snuck a peek at him. He was big and round, and all his layers of puffy clothes made him seem rounder still, like a black version of the Michelin man. He unzipped his parka and I could see a name, Gary, stitched in red over the pocket of his blue coverall. I still didn&#8217;t have a light on; usually I work in the dark, save the light bill for Deb. But I switched it on when he coughed and he smiled at that, like we&#8217;d shared a joke. He had a way of not looking right at you or saying much, but somehow you still knew what he was thinking. Like I knew that he liked secrets, and talking without making sounds. It was neat.
Seemed to me it was looking water–a weird thought out of nowhere–unless it came from him. He seemed to generate them; like he could stand in the middle of a room and in everyone&#8217;s minds, all around him, weird little thoughts would start cropping up–like that one. My tummy sloshing I looked too, and seemed to see through his eyes and not just mine. Through his I wasn&#8217;t sure how to take it: a big dim room haunted by dinosaurs. All the junk of this century comes to rest at Synapses; it gets piled to the ceilings and covered with dust. If it&#8217;s lucky it makes a Head; weird Heads are going to be the thing for Carnival this year, just as they were last, and Debbie&#8217;s are the best. Her finished products are grotesque, but if you call that beautiful then they are; the one she just finished dangles phone cords like Medusa&#8217;s hair, gears like jangling medals. Shelves of visors glint under the ceiling fixture; inlaid with chips and broken bits of circuitry, they hum like artifacts from some Byzantium that isn&#8217;t yet. Two faced Janus masks, their round doll eyes removed; you can wear them either way, male or female, to look in or out.
Gary was staring at them, a strange expression on his face. Like he wanted to throw up.
“Do you think they&#8217;re good?” I asked, to stop him looking like that. 
“Good enough,” he said, “if you like dinosaurs.”
“I like them. They are strange and wonderful.”
“But dinosaurs all the[...]</itunes:summary>

The Eckener Alternative
by James L. Cambias
The Hindenburg swung gently on the mast at Lakehurst as the sky over New  Jersey turned to purple twilight.  All the passengers, the reporters,  the newsreel men were gone.  A couple of sailors stood guard beneath the  big ship to enforce the no-smoking rule.
John Cavalli waited until the watchman below had turned away,  then slid down the stern rope to the ground.  He hunkered down next to  the big rolling anchor weight for a couple of minutes, then hurried off  into the darkness beyond the floodlights.
Once he was clear, Cavalli stopped to peel off the Russian army  arctic commando suit he&#8217;d been wearing ever since the Zeppelin had  lifted off from Frankfurt-am-Main.  It had kept him warm as he hid among  the gas cells with his IR goggles and fire extinguisher, but now in the  warmth of a spring evening it was stifling.
He hit the RETURN button on his wristband and disappeared.
#
&#8220;You can&#8217;t make big changes,&#8221; said the instructor the first day of Temporal Studies class.  He was a very laid-back physicist recruited from California in 2020s.  &#8220;That&#8217;s the most important rule.  The folks we  work for are the result of a particular set of historical events. Change history too much and their probability level drops below 50  percent.  If that happens, all this&#8221; &#8212; his gesture encompassed the Time  Center &#8212; goes away and we&#8217;re out of a job.  If we even exist anymore.&#8221;
A student in the row ahead of Cavalli raised his hand.  &#8220;What about making little changes?&#8221;
&#8220;Little  changes are fine.  We make little changes all the time.  Most of them  are things like making long-term investments, buying up art treasures  for safekeeping, keeping species from going extinct, that kind of  thing.  You&#8217;re going to learn all about gauging the effect of changes,  avoiding heterodynes and chaotic points, and when it&#8217;s okay to step on  butterflies.&#8221;
Cavalli was listening, but in the margin of his notebook he was doodling airships.

The  timegate stage was dark and the control room was empty, just as he&#8217;d  left it.  The Coke can was still on the console.  Was it maybe a little  further to the left than he remembered?  He stepped off the stage and  took a drink.  Still tasted the same.  It would take a pretty big  timeshift to change the flavor of Coca-Cola.
Cavalli locked the door behind him with his purloined master key  (the Time Center used mechanical locks because they were a bit more  resistant to minor time-shifts) and headed for the library.  He found a  book about Zeppelins he didn&#8217;t remember and skimmed the pages.  Hindenburg served safely until 1939; scrapped when WWII broke out.  No  postwar Zeppelins.  The usual &#8220;return of the airship&#8221; speculations.
Damn.  It hadn&#8217;t worked.  He had hoped erasing the vivid image  of the Hindenburg fire would have been enough to keep passenger  airships alive, but the war still marked the end of their era.
#
&#8220;So why don&#8217;t we stop things like the Holocaust or the firebombing of  Dresden?&#8221;  It was a relatively quiet dorm room party with half a dozen  trainees blowing off steam after the first written exam.  Cavalli didn&#8217;t  see who asked the question, but he sounded drunk.
Anna Kyle, the third-year trainee, answered. &#8220;Too big.  The  models predict major shifts in the 21st Century if there&#8217;s no  Holocaust.  You lose the Cold War and the whole Jihad era.  We just stay  away from World War II if we can help it.  Rescue a few things from  museums before they get flattened, take some videos for historians,  that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
&#8220;Why not stop the whole war?[...]</itunes:summary>

&#8220;You don&#8217;t look like an omnivore.&#8221;
I was supposed to spend the next several years working side-by-side
with this bear monster thing from an unpronounceable planet, and the
first words she speaks to me are these.
&#8220;Excuse me?&#8221;
&#8220;Your teeth are flat,&#8221; she hissed.  &#8220;Like a herbivore&#8217;s.&#8221;
I had been waiting in the tiered square outside the Hall of Harmony,
main office of the Galactic police force officially called the
Harmonizers, but which everyone really called the Predators.
Neelee-ornor is one of those planets that makes me a believer.  Cities
crowd right into forests as thick as the Amazon, and both somehow thrive
with riotous abandon.  It proves the Galactic creed really means
something.  Something worth fighting for.  Something that could get me
to take this thankless job.
So I waited to meet my partner, as I sat on a cool stone bench under a
huge branch dripping green saprophytes.  The air was damp but smelled,
strangely, like California after the rain, when I would leave CalTech
and hike into the hills.  I almost didn&#8217;t want her to show, so I could
sit and enjoy it.
I really knew only three things about her.  She had about two e-years
under her belt as a Predator.  She was a Sussuratian, a race of fierce
bearlike carnivores evolved from predatory pack animals, only a century
ahead of humanity in entering Galactic Culture.  And she was named
Briaathursiasaliantiormethessess.
God help me.
I rose awkwardly every time a Sussuratian passed, only to sit again
after it walked on.  Finally I gave up, and then a moment later a
Sussuratian bounded out of the passing crowds, and addressed me with
this comment about my eating habits.
I sprung off the bench and bowed slightly.  &#8220;I am Tarkos.&#8221;  We were
talking Galactic.  But my Galactic is pretty good, really.  Better than
hers, I was betting.  Her name, however, was a Sussuratian name, and in
that language a human larynx was hopeless.  Well, here goes.  &#8220;I am
honored to meet you Briaathursiasaliantiormethessess.&#8221;
She was about six feet long, with short dark fur that had black and
green and gold patterns in it reminiscent of a boa.  She was a
quadraped, and walked on all fours, her claws clicking.  Now she sat
back on her haunches and put her front hands together, threading the
seven claws on one hand through the seven on the other.  The effect was
a Kodiak holding a bouquet of knives.  Her four eyes &#8212; two large green
ones set below two small black ones &#8212; fixed on me.
&#8220;I am called Briaathursiasaliantiormethessess,&#8221; she said.
I bowed slightly again.  &#8220;Yes.  I apologize for my pronunciation.&#8221;  I
took a deep breath and tried again.  &#8220;Briaathursiasaliantiormethessess.&#8221;
&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, speaking now very slowly.  &#8220;It&#8217;s
Briaathursiasaliantiormethessess.&#8221;
For the life of me her pronunciation sounded exactly like mine.  Except
with a bunch of hissing involved in all the S&#8217;s.  &#8220;Can I just call you
Bria?&#8221;
Her small black eyes closed.  I knew that expressed something &#8211;
impatience?  Disgust?  Chagrin?  I couldn&#8217;t remember.  It&#8217;s hard to
learn emotional expressions from a crash video course.
&#8220;This assignment is of great importance and could be perilous,&#8221; she
said.  &#8220;I told them I didn&#8217;t want to work with a human.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, thanks for your honesty.&#8221;
She ran her long, dark-red tongue over fangs longer than my fingers.
Maybe she understood human sarcasm, because this 300-kilo carnivore then
offered an explanation:  &#8220;You&#8217;re dangerous.  I fear you.&#8221;
I nodded.  &#8220;Yeah.  I hear that a lot.&#8221;

Overclocking
by James L. Sutter
They’re waiting for him when he comes out of the tank.  Whether plainclothes or just another pair of clockers, he can’t quite tell, but the way they avoid looking in his direction tips him off in a heartbeat.  When Ari Marvel walks by, you _look_.
They start drifting idly in his direction, and that clinches things.  Reaching down into the lining of his pocket, Ari palms the whole batch and trails his hand over the edge of the bridge railing.  The brittle grey modsticks crumble with ease, and by the time the two have dropped their cover and made the sting he’s moved smoothly into position, hands against the brick and legs spread wide.  The pigs don’t even thank him for being so efficient.  The patdown’s rougher than necessary, but after a minute they throw their hoods back up and move off down the street.
Ari runs his hands through his faded blue-green spikes, then takes the stairs down to the tube.  A beginner might have lingered at the railing and thought about all the time and money now floating down the culvert, but Ari doesn’t look back.  Necessary expenditures.  Expected losses.
It’s just business, baby.
#
Back at the pad, Maggie’s waiting by the door.  She looks like hell: hair in ratty dreads, shirt stained with god-knows-what.  Crust in her eyes.
“Hey, Ari,” she says.
Ari slides his keycard into the lock, checking first to see if the hair he put over the swipestripe has been moved.  Still there.  It doesn’t mean that nobody’s been there, of course&#8211;just that if they have been, they’re good enough that there’s no point in worrying about it.  You win some, you lose some.
Inside, it looks like he’s won.  Maggie plops down on the couch, worrying a hangnail that’s started to bleed.  Her foot taps on the coffee table.
“Hey,” she says again.  He drops his coat onto the chair and moves into the kitchen to get a soda.  She picks up the remote and begins flipping rapidly through the channels, then turns the set off again.  Eventually he leaves the can on the counter and comes back into the living room, sitting down on the coffee table across from her and taking her hands.
“Maggie, look at me.” She does&#8211;or, at least, as well as she’s able to at this point.
“I’m only going to say this once.  You’re welcome to crash here, but you’re not getting a fix.  I won’t have that in my house.  You understand?”
She nods&#8211;those wide doe eyes the color of egg yolk&#8211;then goes back to gnawing at her thumb.  He stands and leaves her there, entering the bedroom and closing the door.  Once it’s locked, he jimmies loose the bottom drawer of the dresser and flips a wad of sweaty bills into the crudely carved hollow.  Then he drops fully clothed onto the mattress and covers his eyes with his forearm, blocking out the ruddy afternoon light that still filters in through heavy curtains. Out in the apartment, he can hear her moving about restlessly.
He&#8217;s doing it again.  It doesn&#8217;t matter that he knows how it&#8217;ll end, that he knows how it _has_ ended more than once.  It&#8217;s simply a given: she&#8217;ll show up.  He&#8217;ll let her in.  Things will proceed accordingly.  He bears down with his arm until the muted red of his eyelids turns to black, and then to stars.
The worst of it is that even through the filth, he can still see her.  Inside the shell of those dreads, her hair is still gold verging on white, so fine as to be almost intangible.  Behind the bruises and bags, her eyes would still crinkle upward if she smiled.  And if he opened his arms, she might still flow into them like water, sparkling and warm and full of life.
Ari is not a stupid man, but Maggie is an exception.
Eyes clenched tight, Ari curls up on his side and falls asleep.

Devour
By Ferrett Steinmetz
&#8220;I want some water,&#8221; Sergio says.  The bicycle chains clank as he strains to
put his feet on the floor.
Sergio designed his own restraints.  He had at least fifteen plumbers on his
payroll who could have installed the chains &#8211; but Sergio&#8217;s never trusted
anything he didn&#8217;t build with his own hands.  So he deep-drilled gear mounts
into our guest room&#8217;s floral wallpaper, leaving me to string greased roller
chains through the cast-iron curlicues of the canopy bed.
&#8220;You&#8217;re doing well, Bruce,&#8221; he lied, trying to smile &#8211; but his lips were
already desiccated, pulled too tight at the edges.  Not his lips at all.
I slowed him down; I had soft lawyer&#8217;s hands, more used to keyboards than
Allen wrenches.  Yet we both knew it would be the last time we could touch
each other.  So I asked for help I didn&#8217;t need, and he took my hands in his
to guide the chains through what he referred to as &#8220;the marionette mounts.&#8221;

Then he sat on the bed and held out his wrists while I snapped the manacles
on &#8211; the chamois lining was my idea &#8211; and we kissed.  It was a long, slow
kiss that needed to summarize thirty-two years of marriage. And it should
have been comforting, but his mouth was a betrayal.  His lips had resorbed
from their lush plumpness.  His tongue had withdrawn to a stub.
His kiss still sent flutters down my spine.
I pressed my hands against his back, moving towards making love, but Sergio
pushed me away.  &#8221;We don&#8217;t know how transmissible this is,&#8221; he said.  Then
he tugged on the chains to verify he could lie down and sit up, but not
leave the bed.
I pressed the keys into his palm, trying to burn the feeling of his skin
into mine forever.  He snipped the keys in half with a bolt-cutter, then
flung it all into the corner.
&#8220;That&#8217;s that,&#8221; he said, and rolled away from me to cry.  My arms ached -
still ache &#8211; from not being able to hold him.
Six days later, I&#8217;m still here.  And Sergio is still leaving.
&#8220;I want some water,&#8221; he repeats now.  Louder, more insistent.  Too angry to
be really Sergio.
&#8220;You never wanted water before,&#8221; I say, keeping a careful distance from the
bed.  &#8221;You like orange juice.&#8221;
Sergio tries to put his head in his hands.  The chains pull him short.
&#8220;For Christ&#8217;s sake, Bruce,&#8221; he says.  &#8221;I&#8217;m dying.  There are going to be
changes.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I say guardedly.  &#8221;There are.&#8221;
&#8220;And it&#8217;s apple cider I like.  In a chilled glass.  From the local guao yan,
no, orchard &#8211; and not that sugared crap you like.  Don&#8217;t try to trick me,
okay?  It&#8217;s just insulting to.&#8221;
He almost says to us, but then shudders.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to do anything crazy with water,&#8221; he begs.  &#8221;I can&#8217;t turn it
into. what&#8217;s the word?  Flamethrowers.  It&#8217;s water.  I&#8217;m just. thirsty.
I&#8217;ll fight with you about the things that matter, but.
&#8220;Just get me some damn water!&#8221; he barks.  I stare at him, knowing the old
Sergio never yelled, wondering how much is left.
Because I can see the traces of a young Sergio within the thing trapped in
the four-poster right now.  Sergio always had that perfect, youthful mix of
good cheekbones and lean muscle.  Now, his thighs and biceps are swollen
like a hormone-stuffed steer &#8211; but aside from that, Sergio would be the envy
of any plastic surgeon.  His crow&#8217;s feet have been pulled from his skin, his
collagen replenished.  His hair, once a brilliant mane of salt-and-pepper
curls, has turned a lank black at the roots.  It looks like some horrid[...]</itunes:summary>

The Ghost of a Girl Who Never Lived
By Keffy R. M. Kehrli
I am Sara&#8217;s second body.
My first memory is of Sara&#8217;s resurrection in a room that smelled of cotton balls and hydrogen peroxide.
&#8220;That&#8217;s funny,&#8221; a man said.
The world felt raw, sore, and new. Under my back, my butt, my fingertips, I could feel every thread in the sheets beneath me. The blanket over my stomach scratched. Padded straps crossed my arms.
&#8220;What&#8217;s funny?&#8221; This voice was a woman&#8217;s.
&#8220;Got another error message,&#8221; the man answered. &#8220;Have you ever seen that one before?&#8221;
I felt the sheets with Sara&#8217;s fingers, and the texture conjured memories I didn&#8217;t have. I should have known where I was and what I was there for, but I couldn&#8217;t catch hold of the fleeting thoughts. In the dim light of the room I could only see the ceiling.
&#8220;Let me see.&#8221; I heard a frenzied clicking. &#8220;It failed twice?&#8221;
&#8220;Nothing copied the first time, so I started over. It got about halfway through, and then it gave me this.&#8221;
&#8220;Error two-one-five-two. Copy error,&#8221; the woman said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen that before. I&#8217;ve never even seen an error in the middle of a transplant. Did you check the manual?&#8221;
&#8220;It didn&#8217;t list this one.&#8221;
The woman sighed and said, &#8220;The only thing I can think of is if we wipe everything back out and start over.&#8221;
 Operating tables, and the anesthetician’s face. Tissue paper examining tables, candles in a church.
&#8220;She&#8217;s conscious, though,&#8221; the man said. &#8220;When the machine aborted, it sent the Copy Completed code. Don&#8217;t look at me like that! I don&#8217;t know if I ought to mess around with it anymore, or&#8230;&#8221;
The woman interrupted, &#8220;You know we can’t do that without contacting the parents. Come on, we might as well go see what the damage is.&#8221;
They stood over me. The man was the younger of the two, and he looked down at me from behind thick glasses. He held his clipboard tight against his chest like a shield. The woman stood closer to me; her hair was light, either blond or grey. She frowned like it was my fault.
&#8220;Can you hear and understand me?&#8221; she asked.
The man wrote something on his clipboard. I could hear graphite rubbed free, caught in the paper.
My mouth felt dry, and my lips did too, as though if I tried to speak they would break apart. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; I managed.
She unhooked the straps on my arms. I lifted my left arm and looked at the fingers, hand, wrist. Clean, and smooth, unmarked.
Cat-scratch scar near my first knuckle, angry red and faded pink.
&#8220;Do you know why you&#8217;re here?&#8221;
I wanted to say the right thing, but I didn’t know what that would be. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t.&#8221;
&#8220;She&#8217;s coherent,&#8221; the woman said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to call the parents.&#8221;
The man nodded, and he was still writing. Scratch scratch scratch. He didn&#8217;t answer her.
The woman disconnected something that slid out from under the skin of my scalp, and I didn&#8217;t like how it rubbed against my skull. &#8220;Make sure you tell them that we won&#8217;t require the final payment until we get this sorted.&#8221;
&#8220;Copy error,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Is that why I don&#8217;t know where we are?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, Sara,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think.&#8221;
#
I walk until I find a cabin in the woods, the windows broken out by tree branches, by wind and rain and thrown rocks. The door hangs far on its hinges.
Shotgun shells, wet with rain. Raccoon droppings. These are the things that litter the floor inside. I step over them in Sara&#8217;s boots, into a [...]</itunes:summary>

Hello everyone,
Can we talk about Fringe for a second? It’s somehow managed to survive to a fourth season on Fox, which is a feat in and of itself. But it’s also managed to keep the monsters of the week new and interesting, even when they’re new iterations of the same monsters of the week because we’re now in a slightly more adjacent parallel universe than the one we’d gotten used to. And when the new monsters are the old good guys.
It’s also notable for surviving because we’re kind of awash in fantasy on the (American) teevee right now. Grimm, Being Human, and Once Upon a Time are the new-ish ‘genre’ shows, and SyFy, which some of you elderly folks may remember as the SciFi channel, doesn’t have a science fiction series that isn’t imminently headed for the grave.
Which is kind of a show of how fickle the fates of TV production is, and how swiftly the tide can shift away once a new shiny happy fun ball enters the room.
But Fringe continues to turn in the solid mediations on the endless strange that lurks in the corners of space-time, while keeping you caring about characters even as many of them permutate as the show moves from universe to universe.
This month we bring you a trio of stories from Judith Tarr, Randy Henderson, and Zachary Jernigan. They contain dinosaurs, a future of literature or at least novels, and the souls of Earth — in a convenient travel cube.

Pairs
by Zachary Jernigan
I had been practicing turning myself into a knife. Between star systems I gathered and focused my particles into a triangle, a sharp shape. Hurling myself against the diamond-hard walls of my small ship, the point of the weapon hardened. I honed myself.
            You see, I had decided to murder my employer. I had studied his weaknesses and come to believe myself capable of the act. I did not know when and where, nor did I know what would trigger it. I simply knew it had to happen. On that day I would either die or buy myself a measure of freedom.
            Originally, this was the extent of my plan: To serve myself.
My name is Arihant. I am one of two humans still inhabiting a physical form, diminished though it is. Outside the walls of my ship, I am in form a faintly translucent white specter, strong and powerfully built—an artist’s anatomical model. Over the years it has become difficult to remember what my face looked like, and thus my features are only approximately human, my head bare. My eyes glow the color of Earth’s sun.
            I am quite beautiful, Louca tells me. On more than one occasion she has run her hands over the ghostly contours of my body. “I wish you were solid,” she once said. “Oh, Ari. The things I would do to you.”
            Louca is the one I am forced to follow and observe. Her name means crazy—an appropriate name. She is the second human possessing a body. Technically, her body is a black, whale-shaped ship one hundred meters long, but her avatars take the forms of anything she imagines. Very rarely, she is human, and never the same person twice. More often, she wears the bodies of flying animals.
            She dreams of flying, which is appropriate.
            Our profession is transport. For three centuries we have hauled the disembodied souls of Earth—each stored in a projection cube—from star to star to be sold. They are quite expensive, I am told, but I have no understanding of the means of exchange. Nearly everything is hidden from me, and Louca sees nothing.
            The reason souls are bought varies. Often they are kept as curios. Sometimes they are used to attract customers to the buyer’s business. My employer used to goad me on these points: “Is it not wonderful to know your people are put to such good use? Imagine how happy it must make them!”
            But I know the truth. Even without physical bodies, men become lonely. They despair and I feel it. Surely Louca feels it; she goes crazier and crazier in such close proximity to ghosts. Before the events of this story, only the luckiest souls were bought in pairs or groups, a rare occurrence. Now, because of Louca and I, it is the rule that souls must be sold in pairs.
            It is my one accomplishment, making men marginally less alone.
            Still, I arrange nothing—I have no power over the situation. I follow Louca from a distance of one hundred thousand kilometers, never any closer, and report anything unusual. I need not watch very closely. Louca’s duty is to dream violent dreams, to defend and deliver her payload. Hopefully, her capacity for violence will never be tested. She is categorically insane—a fact that, my employer insists, makes her uniquely suited to the job of protector.
            Employer. Job. The terms are ridiculous, for Louca and I are not paid. Our terms of service are not negotiable. I am no one’s employee, but I prefer not to use the word slave. Or master.
            I cling to life. I value it, though what value it has is measured in a mere handful of molecules. I possess no unique or useful knowledge, only memories. My ship, small though it is, has several lifetimes’ worth of entertainment files. [...]</itunes:summary>

Surviving the eBookalypse
by Randy Henderson
I entered the City Public Library wearing my plastic replica chainmail and sword, and my suede &#8220;book jacket&#8221; with a laminated author&#8217;s license clipped to the collar.
Before me stood a fully automated checkout kiosk for scheduling author recitals.  The library floor beyond that was filled with neat rows of author cubicles, each with a desk and chair.  Most were occupied.  The air was filled with the soft tickity-ticking of keyboards, and the smells of coffee, &#8220;New Book&#8221; scented air fresheners, and Cup o’ Soup.  Heads popped up over cubicle walls in response to the clacking of the door, then disappeared again when they saw I was no customer or potential patron.
I understood their disappointed expressions too well.  This was not at all where I thought I would be two years after publishing my first e-book.
A woman’s smile caught my attention.  It was like cherry-haloed sunshine, floating between her neon blue hair and her black lace dress.  She emerged from a cube in the Romance section, walked up to me, leaned in close and sniffed at the air. Then she said with the hint of a Mexican accent, &#8220;I smell a transfer from Bainbridge library, no?  An MFA boy, if I&#8217;m not mistaken?&#8221;
&#8220;That obvious?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;Lucky guess.&#8221;  She laughed, and flicked my author&#8217;s license.  &#8220;Says so right here.&#8221;
&#8220;Oh.  Yes.&#8221;  I felt the fool.  I glanced at her author’s license.  &#8220;Myra Sweet.&#8221;
&#8220;That&#8217;s me,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;So, the great literary novel didn&#8217;t work out like you thought it would, eh?&#8221;
&#8220;You’ve heard of my book?&#8221;
&#8220;No, but it’s the same old story.  Follow me.  I&#8217;ll show you around.&#8221;  She turned and walked away.  I followed in the wake of her sugary perfume, and my eyes were drawn down to the swaying of her hips.  There lie danger, I felt certain, but tempting danger.
On the back of her black suede book jacket were reviews of her work.
&#8220;Myra Sweet&#8217;s recital style would make an audience in Antarctica sweat.&#8221; – Romance Recitals Monthly
&#8220;Sweet lives up to her name with The Bride Wore Pistols.  This one has to be heard to be believed.&#8221; – Jenna Johnson, Amazon-Random House
&#8220;Myra Sweet blends sex and action so seamlessly her work deserves a new genre – sextion?  Sacxy?  Whatever, she&#8217;s smoking hot.&#8221; – Phoenix Jones
I wondered if the reviews were real.  I hoped they weren’t.  If someone with reviews like that didn’t have a patron supporting her, what chance did I have?  I reached back to make sure the blurb for my own book, &#8220;Magic Daze and Dark Knights,&#8221; was still Velcroed securely to the back of my jacket.
We walked past the row of thriller authors, almost exclusively men with crew cuts dressed in various colored jumpsuits and bomber-style book jackets.  A few of them gave me an informal salute or a cursory nod as we passed, and their musk cologne made me cough in response.
We passed the row of horror authors, with their all-black clothing, red or black hair, and pale skin.  Most of them arched a single eyebrow at me, or stared at me until I looked away.
Further off I saw cowboys and cowgirls, Renaissance-garbed folks, and business-casual attire.  Seeing so many authors of the same genre together just reinforced my opinion that &#8220;dressing to genre&#8221; was not a good idea for everyone.  One man&#8217;s mustachio was another man&#8217;s weasely whiskers.  One woman&#8217;s ghostly was another woman&#8217;s sickly.  It reminded me to straighten my posture and suck in my modest gut.
At the back of the library was a &#8220;timeline of books&#8221; displayed across the wall.  We walked along it,[...]</itunes:summary>

REVENANTS
by Judith Tarr
Janie wanted to pet the pterodactyl.
“Here’s the auk,” I said. “Look how soft his feathers are. Look at the dodo, isn’t he funny? Don’t you want to give the quagga a carrot?”
Janie wouldn’t even dignify that with disgust. It was the pterodactyl or nothing.
Janie is four. At four, all or nothing isn’t a philosophy, it’s universal law. A very intelligent four can argue that this is the Greater Metro Revenants’ Zoo, yes? And this is the room where they keep the ones that can be petted, yes? So why can’t a person pet the pterodactyl?
No use explaining that everything else was inoculated and immunized and sterilized and rendered safe for children to handle. Everything but the pterodactyl. They’d just made it, and it was supposed to be pettable when they were done, but not yet. There’d been plenty of controversy about putting it on display so soon, but public outcry won out over scientific common sense. So the thing was on display, but behind neoglas inlaid with the injunction: No, I’m Not Ready Yet. Look, But Don’t Touch.
Janie reads. I should know. It’s one of the chief points of debate between her father and me. She could read the warning as well as I could. “So why can’t I touch? I want to touch!”
She was fast winding up to a tantrum. I could stop it now and risk an injunction for public child abuse, or wait till it became a nuisance and we were both shuffled off the premises.
Inside its enclosure, the pterodactyl stretched its wings and opened its beak and hissed. Neoglas is new, about as new as revenants; it’s one-way to sound as well as sight. The pterodactyl couldn’t see us or hear us, which was lucky for Janie. I wished we couldn’t see or hear it, either.
It wasn’t particularly ugly, just strange. One whole faction of paleontologists had been thrown out into the cold when the thing came out of its vat warm-blooded and covered with soft silvery-white fur. Without the fur it would have been a leathery lizardlike thing with batwings. With the fur it looked like a white bat with a peculiar, half-avian, half-saurian head, and extremely convincing talons.
Janie’s fixation and the thing’s furriness notwithstanding, it didn’t look very pettable. Its eyes were a disturbing shade of red, with pinpoint pupils. I wondered if it was hungry, or if it wanted to stretch its wings and fly.
Janie had stopped whining. She was going to howl next.
Something bellowed in the bowels of the building. Janie’s mouth snapped shut.
“There,” I said. “Look what you did.”
If that got me cited, let it. It cut off Janie’s howl before it started.
“They’ve got something big down there,” somebody said.
“Probably the aurochs,” said somebody else.
“Mammoths trumpet like elephants.”
“Maybe it’s a T. Rex,” said a kid’s voice.
“They don’t have one of those yet,” said the one who knew it all. “They’d need a bigger enclosure than they can afford to build, with a stronger perimeter field. So they’re bringing back later things, because they’re smaller.”
“But if they’ve got the mammoths—”
“Mammoths don’t have teeth as long as your arm. They don’t eat people.”
Janie’s eyes were as big as they can get. I got her out of there before she decided she wanted to howl after all.
Ice cream distracted her. So did a pony ride in the zoo’s park—the pony was a Merychippus, a handsome little dun that looked perfectly ponylike except for the pair of vestigial toes flanking each of its hooves. By the time we picked up our picnic and headed for the tables by the mammoths’ pit, I was starting to breathe almost normally.
If you haven’t got your kid license yet, you can only imagine you know what it’s like to take the qualifying exam. Studying for it is hell, and the practicum’s a raving bitch. Then when you pass and get the kid, six times out o[...]</itunes:summary>

Dear Faithful Listeners And Readers—
Happy 2012! It&#8217;s looking to be a very exciting year at Escape Pod, and we&#8217;re delighted you&#8217;re still hanging out with us!
We had a lot of fun bringing you different things in 2011, from our first audio drama at the end of the year to the various story collections to our supporters. And thanks to your supporters, by the way. It&#8217;s amazing to realize we&#8217;re in our seventh year doing this, and we&#8217;ve operated in the black the entire time. We couldn&#8217;t have done that without you, so thank you.
To be completely honest, it hasn&#8217;t been smooth sailing. We got behind in submissions this year, even with some time off to catch up. Authors got angry, as they should have done, and we&#8217;ve figured out where things went wrong and are working on fixing it. I won&#8217;t offer excuses, only that I&#8217;m responsible for this magazine and I let down our authors, and I&#8217;m very sorry for this. We&#8217;re closing our doors to submissions in January in order to get everything organized.
Hugo voting is open, from now until March 31! I&#8217;ll have a blog post soon about what Escape Pod has offered that is eligible, and we&#8217;re appreciate a consideration if you&#8217;re eligible to nominate.
Resolutions are promises to fail, so we won&#8217;t make any, but we do promise to continue to bring you weekly SF that will be fun. And lose those 10 pounds, of course.
Have a safe and happy 2012. Be mighty, and have fun!

When we lost control we gathered the best &#8212; scientists, economists, engineers, architects into the CPF ….

SAM:  		You think?
MEL:  	No, I mean in the CPF.  The main power was rated for fifty years, then if nobody woke us up the backup was supposed to kick in.   But for some reason, it’s only running at half power.  Whole sections are shutting down.  I was lucky, I just barely escaped being d[...]</itunes:summary>

Long Winter&#8217;s Nap
by Catherine H. Shaffer
“Eat,” said MooninMama, “You have a long winter ahead.” LittlestOne turned her head away as MooninMama lifted the spoon of raspberry pie dripping with honey and caribou fat. LittlestOne was sleepy, too sleepy, for what she planned.
“I am already full,” said LittlestOne. Her stomach rumbled, giving away her lie.
MooninMama shrugged and set the plate away. It was beginning to get cold in the cave as the crackling fire burned down to embers. Soon it would be time to sleep, time to dream of spring, when they would awaken, shivering, and find that Santy Clawr had visited them.

MooninMama lay next to YediDaddy and pulled LittlestOne down between them, like a baby. All of the others had their own beds.
The hardest part was lying still between MooninMama and YediDaddy without falling asleep. It wasn’t like going to sleep at night. There were no blankets to keep them warm, though they had soft beds. More than once, LittlestOne shook herself awake after accidentally nodding off. She wasn’t sure she could fight off the long sleep by simple force of will, not with the cold coming down into her bones.
She peeked out from beneath her heavy lids and the cave was dark except for the thin, crackly lines of orange from the dying embers in the fire pit. The taste of sugar rose to her tongue and her hands and feet began to tingle.
MooninMama was still, her breath coming softer and fainter each time. Her bright blue eyes were closed and her cheek as soft as a baby’s. Chestnut hair fanned around her shoulders. Her breasts rose and fell softly with her breath. YediDaddy wasn’t breathing at all. There was a faint beard of frost on his face, decorating the stubble on his chin. All around lay LittlestOne’s brothers and sisters, their children, her aunts and uncles and cousins, her grandparents, and all the other people of the tribe.
In the summer, when the tribe slept, there were all sorts of sounds in the night. People coughing, snoring, and sometimes laughing, but here there was nothing but a deep silence.
LittlestOne stood up and shook the tingling out. She felt a pang of longing looking at her parents hibernating, but it wasn’t enough to keep her with them. She turned to sneak out. She felt dizzy and stumbled several times as she tiptoed across the sleeping bodies of her tribe. Nothing would wake them now but Spring.
LittlestOne crawled out of the cave and went to the summer house that YediDaddy had built. She lit a fire and crouched beside it. When she felt completely awake, she went out into the night. It was snowing softly, and there weren’t any stars. She had never been so alone.
But she resisted the temptation to go back to the cave with her family. She imagined what they would say when she told them she had met Santy Clawr. They wouldn’t think she was such a baby, then!
