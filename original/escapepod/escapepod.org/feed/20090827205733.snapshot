<p><em>He was in Piet&#8217;s Number Seven, a bar-cum-caravanserai in an illegal orbit trailing far enough behind Vesta to be ignorable.  Piet&#8217;s had been instantiated in an old volatiles bladder that had done the Jovian run a few too many times before falling into the surplus circuit.  You could store entire cities in Piet&#8217;s cubage, which made for a somewhat attenuated bar experience.

When I met Skinhorse, my first thought was old.  Which was weird.  Nobody gets old these days.  We all die young, some of us after living a long time, if we're lucky.

He was in Piet's Number Seven, a bar-cum-caravanserai in an illegal orbit trailing far enough behind Vesta to be ignorable.  Piet's had been instantiated in an old volatiles bladder that had done the Jovian run a few too many times before falling into the surplus circuit.  You could store entire cities in Piet's cubage, which made for a somewhat attenuated bar experience.  Plus the place had one of those gravity cans -- yes, those gravity cans -- which meant your drink stayed stuck down long as you were near a Higgs carpet.

So there I was annoying myself with three perfectly disrespectable rock jocks, each of us out to fleece the others, when this cadaver starts to stand over me.  We're all forever young or forever dead, but this armstrong looked like he'd shaved about half a cent too deep across his whole body, then restored his dermis with spray-on thermal insulation.

Rated R for strong language, strong violence, and world-spanning tumors.

By then we were monitoring Wren Hepta-Yemenni. She fell into bed with Dorado ambassador 214, though I donrsquo;t know what he did to deserve it and she didnrsquo;t even seem sad when he expired.

You can tell the British bluebell because the flowers are smaller, deeper blue, and they&#8217;re usually

We've got robotic arms to put the eyeballs in. Metal clamps to pulldown the eyelids. Tony, on Four, keeps the grease vats filled. Oil squirts nineteen times a minute to keep the eye sockets from squeaking. Tiny slick needles stitch on the lashes, while millions of different irises get stamped in magenta and yellow and cyan, so no two will ever be alike, just like us.

All that, and they can't engineer anythingmdash;or anyonemdash;to take over my job. People in Organs go home coated with grease and vinegar; people in Bones have lost fingers to the machines, and still nobody wants the job where a hundred half-live cyborgs line up in rows, twitching when your back is turned. Waiting for someone to talk to them, feel for them. Transcend them to life.


There are safety signs around the factory. "Scrub Up." "Know Thyself." "Don't Blink." That last is the best piece of advice, here on the eyeball floor.

No spaceships will loom large in blue skies, nor hover over our cities. At night, though, when we see blinking dots of light near the horizon, as small and pale as any star, we'll think they're planes or satellites of human origin. They won't be. These are alien ships, come for conquest.

That is all we can see. What we hear is just as faint and difficult to resolve: we hear rumors. Or rather, one persistent rumor: "the aliens want volunteers."

We set down in Pekoi as part of the organics inquisition team, still stinking of the last city. We're all muscle. Not brains. The brains are out eating at the foreignersrsquo; push downtown, and they donrsquo;t care if we whore around the tourist dregs half the night so long as somebodyrsquo;s sober enough to haul them out come morning. When the brains arenrsquo;t eating, theyrsquo;re pretending to give us directions in the field, telling us where to sniff out organics. Theyrsquo;re writing reports about
how dangerous Pekoi is to the civilized world.

Wersquo;re swapping off some boy in a backwater push the locals cleared out for us. Wersquo;re sitting around a low table. I pass off another card to Kep. Luce swaps out a suit. She has to sit on one leg to lean over the table. Itrsquo;s hot in the low room, so humid that moths clutter aroundour feet, too heavy to fly.

The boyrsquo;s making little mewling sounds again. Somebody should shut him up, but not me. This is my hand. Irsquo;m ahead.

Rated R for violence and sexual situations.

"Buggerit, I don't have time for this," Joe muttered. The stable waiting for the small herd of cloned spidercows cluttering up the north paddock was still knee-deep in manure, and the tractor seat wasn't getting any warmer while he shivered out here waiting for Maddie to come and sort this thing out. It wasn't a big herd, but it was as big as his land and his labour could manage ndash; the big biofabricator in the shed could assemble mammalian livestock faster than he could feed them up and sell them with an honest HAND-RAISED NOT VAT-GROWN label.

"What do you want with us?" he yelled up at the gently buzzing farm.

"Brains, fresh brains for baby Jesus," crooned the farm in a warm contralto, startling Joe half out of his skin. "Buy my brains!" Half a dozen disturbing cauliflower shapes poked suggestively out of the farms' back then retracted again, coyly.

"Don't want no brains around here," Joe said stubbornly, his fingers whitening on the stock of the shotgun. "Don't want your kind round here, neither. Go away."

Rated PG for strong language, chemical violence, and drug-abusing dogs.

Some of them you’ll have seen, some you won’t, some you’ll agree with me on and some you’ll wonder what I was drinking when I watched them but that’s half the fun.

Kevin switched the audio over to the projector. The lecture hall was filled with outdoor noises. Wind hummed softly over the microphone, cattle lowed nearby, a truck accelerated in the distance.

A roan steer staggered around a concreted yard, its mute distress accompanied by clattering hooves and the fleshy slap of its thigh striking the ground when it fell. A new sound was introduced - incongruous, but familiar to Kevin's audience.

Whale song.

Gradually, the cow's shaking stilled, until it could stand securely. Its muscles continued to tremble, but not enough to upset its equilibrium while it listened.

Rated PG-13 for violence and mad cow disease.

Zhi 4's scream pierces the Siberian night. 



My spiked metal boots crunch through the snow as I race towards him, with Zhi 6 running at my side. The nanochip in my brainstem clicks on, and I reach out with my mind, but I can't sense even a trace of Zhi 4. A few seconds earlier his form had been outlined by the dark turquoise glow of the force field.



We stop twenty feet short of the field's perimeter. Beyond it, the hazy silhouette of the colossal Stalk looms, its millions of cilia undulating.


My bodysuit hums as it transmits data back to Xiang Xu Base, situated behind the Rusanov ice cap half a mile away.



My pulse flutters in anticipation and I take a deep breath to try to rein in my excitement. I -- like all Zhis -- have been designed with an insatiable curiosity about the Stalk's origins and vulnerabilities. Knowing I've been bred to feel this way doesn't make me feel it any less. Where did the Stalk come from? Why is it here? How can it thrive in these temperatures? I see the same questions reflected in Zhi 6's expression.

Rated PG-13 for cloning and some adult themes.

 "You're a disgrace to your calling and your species." The Cardinal's words were at odds with the verging-on-seductive voice of the translator embedded in the Anturean's Chlor-tank. From beneath lowered lashes Ignatz O'Reilly, D.D. Inter-Species, watched his superior's mouth-tendrils vibrate, a gesture he knew denoted extreme lust or mounting rage.

 Lust was out of the question, he supposed.

 "Falling-down drunk at Mass. Passing out in Confession. And don't think your little black-market dealings go unnoticed." The Cardinal's posterior spines flushed blue. Ignatz averted his eyes even further, studying the faint brown lines crisscrossing each other on a slate floor the color of dried blood. The mutant squid bastard really was mad this time. 

 "If I might be permitted to explain, Your Eminence..." Ignatz's tongue tasted like last night's liquor. "I indulge for purely medicinal reasons...a slight asthmatic condition...any allegations that I would engage in illegal..."

Rated R for religious themes, carousing, and transubstantiaton of a different sort.

<p>There are a number of good writers now breaking into the big leagues through podcasting.  My friend <a href="http://jchutchins.net">J.C. Hutchins</a> is one of them.  I loved his <a href="http://www.7thsonnovel.com">7th Son</a> trilogy, and I jumped at the chance when he asked me to read an advance copy of his horror novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312383827?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=escapepod-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0312383827">Personal Effects: Dark Art</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=escapepod-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=0312383827" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> and record a reaction for him.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my initial reaction (Hutch liked it enough that he added the background music and bumper titling and such):</p>

<p><object width="360" height="207"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4947110&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00adef&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4947110&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00adef&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="360" height="207"></embed></object></p>

<p>And here&#8217;s the big group &#8220;vlurb&#8221; project that my piece was a part of:</p>

<p><object width="360" height="207"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5070261&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00adef&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5070261&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00adef&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="360" height="207"></embed></object></p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/5070261">J.C. Hutchins&#8217;s &#8220;Personal Effects: Dark Art&#8221; - SuperVlurb</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/sfeley">Stephen Eley</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>(The folks in that vlurb are all awesome and you should check out their sites: <a href="http://PJBallantine.com">Philippa Ballantine</a>, <a href="http://scottsigler.com">Scott Sigler</a>, <a href="http://sethharwood.com">Seth Harwood</a>, <a href="http://wordsushi.com">Mark Yoshimoto Nemcoff</a>, <a href="http://christianaellis.com">Christiana Ellis</a>, <a href="http://Matt-Wallace.com">Matt Wallace</a>, <a href="http://jamesmelzer.net">James Melzer</a>, <a href="http://maxquickseries.com">Mark Jeffrey</a>, <a href="http://murverse.com">Mur Lafferty</a>, <a href="http://crescentstation.net">Phil Rossi</a> and <a href="http://mattselznick.com">Matt Selznick</a>.)</p>

<p>I read the book in PDF form.  And then I pre-ordered it on Amazon, because it&#8217;s just that good.  (Also because the little goodies that come with the physical copy sound like fun.)  This is an unusual horror novel: it brings in a lot of conventional settings and tropes, but the characters break from formula in some surprising ways.  And it&#8217;s a <i>smart</i> horror novel.  Silliness in hats aside, I highly recommend it.</p>

<p><em>Mr. Wayne was taking his daily exercise, walking Arthur around the lake in Nevley Park, when the sky darkened and a light snow began to fall. A few flakes fluttered against his cheeks. He could feel the cold through his heavy topcoat. He enjoyed the park when it was deserted, but at his age he couldn&#8217;t afford a chill. He thumbed the control in his pocket. Arthur turned left onto a bridge that would cut their return journey by a good half mile. Mr. Wayne followed.</em></p>

Kegelman-Ballston Corporation is proud to announce the first public release of its new drug, Halitex, which cures Ulbarton’s Flu completely after one ten-pill course of treatment.  Ulbarton’s Flu, as the public knows all too well, now afflicts upwards of thirty million Americans, with the number growing daily as the highly contagious flu spreads.  Halitex “flu-proofs” the body by inserting genes tailored to confer immunity to this persistent and debilitating scourge, whose symptoms include coughing, muscle aches, and fatigue.  Because the virus remains in the body even after symptoms disappear, Ulbarton’s Flu can recur in a given patient at any time.  Halitex renders each recurrence ineffectual.</em></p>

<p>Rated <strong>PG</strong> after intensive clinical testing.</p>

Halitex ldquo;flu-proofsrdquo; the body by inserting genes tailored to confer immunity to this persistent and debilitating scourge, whose symptoms include coughing, muscle aches, and fatigue.  Because the virus remains in the body even after symptoms disappear, Ulbartonrsquo;s Flu can recur in a given patient at any time.  Halitex renders each recurrence ineffectual.

Rated PG after intensive clinical testing.

Some of them you’ll have seen, some you won’t, some you’ll agree with me on and some you’ll wonder what I was drinking when I watched them but that’s half the fun. Spoilers abound so if you haven’t seen the movie and want to be surprised, go rent it now, we’ll be here when you get back.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>Just a quick note that Escape Pod episode 200 will <em>probably</em> not be going out on our usual Thursday schedule this week.  We&#8217;ve been negotiating for the rights to a Major Story by a Major Author.  We&#8217;re dealing with the literary agency for the author&#8217;s estate, which is always a slower process than working with living authors directly.  Everything appears to be a green light and the story production is moving ahead at speed, but we&#8217;re waiting on final signatures.  It&#8217;s my expectation that we&#8217;ll have the episode out within a few days.  (Certainly before next week&#8217;s regularly scheduled EP201!)</p>

<p>And it&#8217;s worth it.  When you hear the story I think you&#8217;ll agree.  Thank you for your patience.</p>

<p>&mdash; Steve</p>

<p><em>They came from test tubes.  They came pale as ghosts with eyes as blue-white as glacier ice.  They came first out of Korea.</em></p>

<p><em> I try to picture David’s face in my head, but I can’t.  They’ve told me this is temporary—a kind of shock that happens sometimes when you’ve seen a person die that way.  Although I try to picture David’s face, it’s only his pale eyes I can see.</em></p>

<p><em> My sister squeezes my hand in the back of the limo.  “It’s almost over,” she says.  Up the road, against the long, wrought iron railing, the protestors grow excited as our procession approaches.  They’re standing in the snow on both sides of the cemetery gates, men and women wearing hats and gloves and looks of righteous indignation, carrying signs I refuse to read.

 I try to picture Davidrsquo;s face in my head, but I canrsquo;t.  Theyrsquo;ve told me this is temporarymdash;a kind of shock that happens sometimes when yoursquo;ve seen a person die that way.  Although I try to picture Davidrsquo;s face, itrsquo;s only his pale eyes I can see.

 My sister squeezes my hand in the back of the limo.  ldquo;Itrsquo;s almost over,rdquo; she says.  Up the road, against the long, wrought iron railing, the protestors grow excited as our procession approaches.  Theyrsquo;re standing in the snow on both sides of the cemetery gates, men and women wearing hats and gloves and looks of righteous indignation, carrying signs I refuse to read.


Rated PG-13.  Contains racism and genetic engineering.

"Maybe it's what you'd do with the knowledge that determines whether or not you'll discover the secret of time travel."

"What?" I asked the old man.

"I know for a fact that time travel is possible. I knew the man who discovered it. And you'll never guess what he used his discovery for."

Well, I didn't believe that old man any more than you believe me, but we'd been waiting in that airport for four hours, so I humored him.

"All right, I'll bite," I said. "What did he use time travel for?"

"Wally didn't need to see the pyramids getting built, or sail with Columbus, or even watch JFK's assassination. What Wally wanted to do, more than anything, was get to work on time."

<p><em>Imagine a cross between Byzantium and a termite mound. Imagine a jeweled mountain, slender as an icicle, rising out of the steam jungles and disappearing into the dazzling pearl-grey skies of Gehenna.

It's going to be the Three of Clubs.

I know this, as certainly as I know my own name.  I'm less sure about some things than my fans would think.  But sometimes, the swirling laws governing what may happen coalesce into what will happen with astonishing clarity.  The sun will rise tomorrow, the Pirates will beat the Mets tonight, and as soon as I announce my "guess," the Three of Clubs will appear on the monitor in front of me.

"Jack of Spades," I proclaim, full of conviction.

The monitor flickers, and is suddenly filled by a pixilated version of the Three of Clubs.

 Bars of light crossed my desk, carved from the sun by the open window. The
scent of hot asphalt rose from the path that led to the capitol buildings.

Beside me, Dr. Singh motioned for the guards to bring in Dr. Norman
Terriault. He looked pale. I motioned for him to sit.

The guards stood on either side. The officer saluted.

I closed the window. A faint buzzing hovered in the air.

"Why me?" Terriault asked.

"You must be familiar with the work of the Imitant Office," Singh consulted
his tablet, "Dr. Terriault."

"I'm just like both of you." Terriault leaned forward, the guards pulled him
back.

"Apparently," I said.

Rated PG for low intensity inter-species conflict
