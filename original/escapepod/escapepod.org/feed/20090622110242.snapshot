Zhi 4's scream pierces the Siberian night. 



My spiked metal boots crunch through the snow as I race towards him, with Zhi 6 running at my side. The nanochip in my brainstem clicks on, and I reach out with my mind, but I can't sense even a trace of Zhi 4. A few seconds earlier his form had been outlined by the dark turquoise glow of the force field.



We stop twenty feet short of the field's perimeter. Beyond it, the hazy silhouette of the colossal Stalk looms, its millions of cilia undulating.


My bodysuit hums as it transmits data back to Xiang Xu Base, situated behind the Rusanov ice cap half a mile away.



My pulse flutters in anticipation and I take a deep breath to try to rein in my excitement. I -- like all Zhis -- have been designed with an insatiable curiosity about the Stalk's origins and vulnerabilities. Knowing I've been bred to feel this way doesn't make me feel it any less. Where did the Stalk come from? Why is it here? How can it thrive in these temperatures? I see the same questions reflected in Zhi 6's expression.

Rated PG-13 for cloning and some adult themes.

 "You're a disgrace to your calling and your species." The Cardinal's words were at odds with the verging-on-seductive voice of the translator embedded in the Anturean's Chlor-tank. From beneath lowered lashes Ignatz O'Reilly, D.D. Inter-Species, watched his superior's mouth-tendrils vibrate, a gesture he knew denoted extreme lust or mounting rage.

 Lust was out of the question, he supposed.

 "Falling-down drunk at Mass. Passing out in Confession. And don't think your little black-market dealings go unnoticed." The Cardinal's posterior spines flushed blue. Ignatz averted his eyes even further, studying the faint brown lines crisscrossing each other on a slate floor the color of dried blood. The mutant squid bastard really was mad this time. 

 "If I might be permitted to explain, Your Eminence..." Ignatz's tongue tasted like last night's liquor. "I indulge for purely medicinal reasons...a slight asthmatic condition...any allegations that I would engage in illegal..."

Rated R for religious themes, carousing, and transubstantiaton of a different sort.

<p>There are a number of good writers now breaking into the big leagues through podcasting.  My friend <a href="http://jchutchins.net">J.C. Hutchins</a> is one of them.  I loved his <a href="http://www.7thsonnovel.com">7th Son</a> trilogy, and I jumped at the chance when he asked me to read an advance copy of his horror novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312383827?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=escapepod-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0312383827">Personal Effects: Dark Art</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=escapepod-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=0312383827" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> and record a reaction for him.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my initial reaction (Hutch liked it enough that he added the background music and bumper titling and such):</p>

<p><object width="360" height="207"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4947110&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00adef&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4947110&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00adef&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="360" height="207"></embed></object></p>

<p>And here&#8217;s the big group &#8220;vlurb&#8221; project that my piece was a part of:</p>

<p><object width="360" height="207"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5070261&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00adef&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5070261&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00adef&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="360" height="207"></embed></object></p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/5070261">J.C. Hutchins&#8217;s &#8220;Personal Effects: Dark Art&#8221; - SuperVlurb</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/sfeley">Stephen Eley</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>(The folks in that vlurb are all awesome and you should check out their sites: <a href="http://PJBallantine.com">Philippa Ballantine</a>, <a href="http://scottsigler.com">Scott Sigler</a>, <a href="http://sethharwood.com">Seth Harwood</a>, <a href="http://wordsushi.com">Mark Yoshimoto Nemcoff</a>, <a href="http://christianaellis.com">Christiana Ellis</a>, <a href="http://Matt-Wallace.com">Matt Wallace</a>, <a href="http://jamesmelzer.net">James Melzer</a>, <a href="http://maxquickseries.com">Mark Jeffrey</a>, <a href="http://murverse.com">Mur Lafferty</a>, <a href="http://crescentstation.net">Phil Rossi</a> and <a href="http://mattselznick.com">Matt Selznick</a>.)</p>

<p>I read the book in PDF form.  And then I pre-ordered it on Amazon, because it&#8217;s just that good.  (Also because the little goodies that come with the physical copy sound like fun.)  This is an unusual horror novel: it brings in a lot of conventional settings and tropes, but the characters break from formula in some surprising ways.  And it&#8217;s a <i>smart</i> horror novel.  Silliness in hats aside, I highly recommend it.</p>

There are a number of good writers now breaking into the big leagues through podcasting.  My friend J.C. Hutchins is one of them.

<p><em>The biggest rocket ever was the Saturn V.  On the launch pad it was taller than a 30-story building.  Today&#8217;s rockets are smaller and lighter.  Today&#8217;s rockets can be launched more than once.  They have wings and can come back to earth and land like airplanes.</em></p>

<p><em>When a rocket launches, it&#8217;s like an earthquake. The ground is shaking! There is flame and smoke. It&#8217;s like an explosion!</em></p>

<p><em>Antonio is strapped into his seat.  He is about to ride to a space station.  Because there is no air in space, Antonio must wear a space suit.  In the suit, Antonio can breathe and talk over radio.  He wears a helmet with a special faceplate that protects him from the sun.  The fingers of his gloves have tiny claws that help him work with small objects.</em></p>

<p><em>What&#8217;s all that noise? It must be a rocket! Astronauts are traveling to space!</em></p>

Kegelman-Ballston Corporation is proud to announce the first public release of its new drug, Halitex, which cures Ulbarton’s Flu completely after one ten-pill course of treatment.  Ulbarton’s Flu, as the public knows all too well, now afflicts upwards of thirty million Americans, with the number growing daily as the highly contagious flu spreads.  Halitex “flu-proofs” the body by inserting genes tailored to confer immunity to this persistent and debilitating scourge, whose symptoms include coughing, muscle aches, and fatigue.  Because the virus remains in the body even after symptoms disappear, Ulbarton’s Flu can recur in a given patient at any time.  Halitex renders each recurrence ineffectual.</em></p>

Some of them you’ll have seen, some you won’t, some you’ll agree with me on and some you’ll wonder what I was drinking when I watched them but that’s half the fun. Spoilers abound so if you haven’t seen the movie and want to be surprised, go rent it now, we’ll be here when you get back.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>Just a quick note that Escape Pod episode 200 will <em>probably</em> not be going out on our usual Thursday schedule this week.  We&#8217;ve been negotiating for the rights to a Major Story by a Major Author.  We&#8217;re dealing with the literary agency for the author&#8217;s estate, which is always a slower process than working with living authors directly.  Everything appears to be a green light and the story production is moving ahead at speed, but we&#8217;re waiting on final signatures.  It&#8217;s my expectation that we&#8217;ll have the episode out within a few days.  (Certainly before next week&#8217;s regularly scheduled EP201!)</p>

<p>And it&#8217;s worth it.  When you hear the story I think you&#8217;ll agree.  Thank you for your patience.</p>

<p>&mdash; Steve</p>

<p>&#8220;Wally didn&#8217;t need to see the pyramids getting built, or sail with Columbus, or even watch JFK&#8217;s assassination. What Wally wanted to do, more than anything, was get to work on time.&#8221;</p>

Special closing monkey music by George Hrab

Sliding his hands over the clay, Sly relished the moisture oozing around his fingers. The clay matted down the hair on the back of his hands making them look almost human. He turned the potterrsquo;s wheel with his prehensile feet as he shaped the vase. Pinching the clay between his fingers he lifted the wall of the vase, spinning it higher.

Someone banged on the window of his pen. Sly jumped and then screamed as the vase collapsed under its own weight. He spun and hurled it at the picture window like feces. The clay spattered against the Plexiglas, sliding down the window.

Rated PG.  Contains one angry chimp with a potty mouth. Sort of.

It's going to be the Three of Clubs.

I know this, as certainly as I know my own name.  I'm less sure about some things than my fans would think.  But sometimes, the swirling laws governing what may happen coalesce into what will happen with astonishing clarity.  The sun will rise tomorrow, the Pirates will beat the Mets tonight, and as soon as I announce my "guess," the Three of Clubs will appear on the monitor in front of me.

"Jack of Spades," I proclaim, full of conviction.

The monitor flickers, and is suddenly filled by a pixilated version of the Three of Clubs.

Rated PG for...welll, you already know why, don't you?

 Bars of light crossed my desk, carved from the sun by the open window. The
scent of hot asphalt rose from the path that led to the capitol buildings.

Beside me, Dr. Singh motioned for the guards to bring in Dr. Norman
Terriault. He looked pale. I motioned for him to sit.

The guards stood on either side. The officer saluted.

I closed the window. A faint buzzing hovered in the air.

"Why me?" Terriault asked.

"You must be familiar with the work of the Imitant Office," Singh consulted
his tablet, "Dr. Terriault."

"I'm just like both of you." Terriault leaned forward, the guards pulled him
back.

"Apparently," I said.

Rated PG for low intensity inter-species conflict

Adolf Hitler came to Paris in June 1941 feeling the weight of his years in his legs and the taste of a dying dream in his mouth.  He spent most of that first day walking up and down the Champs Elyseacute;es, working the stiffness out of his bones and muscles while he looked at the shops and the people.  Some of the dull ache was from the wooden benches on the train from Hamburg; most of it was age.  And beneath the discomfort of his body, his soul ached too.

He'd never been here before, he thought as the Parisians slipped past in the noon-time sun.  He snorted at the revelation.  A fine painter you are, he told himself.
