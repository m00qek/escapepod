"I know I can't do anything about this--" she gestured toward the tangled blankets, the hospital bed, the pale walls. "But I've asked the doctors to take some cells--I still have a few healthy ones left, you know, and they'll keep for some time--"

I could guess the rest. But Susan, ever the biologist, had her lecture after all. "It doesn't work like that." Her voice was gentle, as if she were speaking to one of her two sons, not to Mom. "A clone isn't the same as the original. Your clone would be no more like you than--than one identical twin is like another. It wouldn't be--" Susan's voice caught. "It wouldn't be you."

"You don't _know,_" Mom said. "None of the clones are old enough to ask yet. They're just babies." 

Rated G: Not for kids, but nothing to worry about if you listen around the kids.

"Laura," a speaker said, as though I hadn't been gone for six years, as though she'd seen me every day in between. "Laura, where is your uncle?"

I used to imagine her disintegrated, torn apart into silent atoms.

"It's not Laura anymore," I said. "It's Lolo. I'm gender neutral."

"I don't understand," she said.

"You've got a Net connection," I said. "Search around on "gender neutral" and "biomod operation."

I wasn't sure if the pause that came after that was for dramatic effect or whether she really was having trouble understanding the search parameters. Then she said, "Ah, I see. When did you do that?"

"Six years ago."

They took Johnny Green from class 3a at ten orsquo; clock on Tuesday morning.  He was the last to go. They thought I didnrsquo;t notice, but Irsquo;ve been onto them for a while now. 

It started nearly two weeks ago. Teaching biology is difficult when yoursquo;ve got a teenage audience. Almost every topic on the syllabus has something about reproduction in it, and that reduces your typical youngster to giggles, rude jokes or hysteria. Irsquo;ve got used to it over the last twenty years, and have come to expect the reactions. Irsquo;ve even come to know who to expect them from.

So when Jack Doyle was quiet during my ldquo;Asexual reproduction in amoebardquo; spiel, I knew immediately that something was wrong. And my sense of wrongness really went into overdrive when he stayed behind after class to ask questions.

Rated PG for asexual reproduction and giggling teens.

Marv snorted. "Calendar calculating. They all do that. Not worth a paper dollar, not even in a carnival sideshow."

"I've heard of it, but -- " Her blue eyes were wide as a con man's smile. "They can all do it?"

"Sure." Marv tilted back, his big wooden chair squeaking. "All the Counters, anyway. It's like the Artists -- they all draw horses. Or dogs. Which is funny, because back when they got their talents you'd never see a horse here in the city. Dogs, okay, no big deal. But you ask any Artist to sketch you a horse, and blam -- if the damn thing galloped off the paper you wouldn't be surprised."

Her gaze went a bit distant. "That's what I'd like," she said. "To become an artist. Or a musician."

But the plane just stopped, and hung there, nose tipped at a slight angle, mere feet from the building.

And that's when the figure -- the one people call the Ambassador, or the Doctor, or the Outsider, or the Professor, or a hundred other names -- appeared. Just a middle-aged man in a white lab coat, with steel-rimmed glasses and graying hair. His image filled the air above the jetliner, like the dome of the sky had been transformed into an IMAX movie screen.

He said, "People of Earth, I have a message for you."

Rated PG  for ennui and futility of life.

Show Notes:

	Tim Pratt is serializing a Marla Mason novel, Broken Mirrors at his website. His first anthology is out this summer from Night Shade Books, Sympathy for the Devil.
Tom Rockwell's work can be found at his personal music website, Devo Spice, The Funny Music Project, and his comedy troupe, Cirque du So What?

It wasn't that Em disapproved of drug use, you just had to be savvy about which drugs you took. Back before she had to get a day job, she was a M@tch girl, much to the delight of the guys on the club scene. M@tch wasn't a wimpy drug, but it didn't turn you into a murderous street zombie either. It was also expensive -- a designer "where it's @!" drug -- that the Tweakers couldn't afford anyway.

Rated R for one sexual scene and drug use.

<p><em>One of the first generation of Krenn had lived long enough to reach the site, though none had expected to. The very first Krenn had conceived of this journey in the distant past, dedicating his life and his posterity to the pilgrimage with an ever recycling population of clones. Like their clone-father, each was an optimized collection of smart matter no bigger than a speck.

One of the first generation of Krenn had lived long enough to reach the site, though none had expected to. The very first Krenn had conceived of this journey in the distant past, dedicating his life and his posterity to the pilgrimage with an ever recycling population of clones. Like their clone-father, each was an optimized collection of smart matter no bigger than a speck. Hundreds of generations of Krenn had lived and died during the voyage, their remains enshrined into niches in the very walls of the vessel that now lay shattered at its destination.

The survivors flooded out upon the steppes of the heel, rejoicing despite the crushing weight that gravity forced upon them. They settled in, constructing mansions of haze and shadow, and waited for enlightenment to come. The mission and purpose of the first Krenn remained with each of them. This place had been the site of the greatest triumph of the greatest archaeocaster in all of history. Before the beginning of the quest, Krennmdash;the original Krennmdash;had felt drawn to it. He had cultivated the tales, sifted myth from coincidence, mastered the lost language of the interview-eschewing, spatial curmudgeons of the ancient dark times, and recreated the route through dimensional puzzles to this theoretical location. The odds of success had been so absurd not a single entelechy of Krenn's cregrave;che dared invest time or expense in the project. And yet, here they were, nearly three hundred unique individuals sharing the template of Krenn.

Her neighbor mdash; the other one, across the hall mdash; helped her figure it out, long before the math geeks finished crunching their numbers.

"Watch," he'd said, and laid a deck of cards facedown on her coffee table. (There was coffee in the cups, with a generous dollop of Bailey's. He was a nice-enough guy that Adele felt comfortable offering this.) He shuffled it with the blurring speed of an expert, cut the deck, shuffled again, then picked up the whole deck and spread it, still facedown. "Pick a card."

Adele picked. The Joker.

"Only two of those in the deck," he said, then shuffled and spread again. "Pick another."

She did, and got the other Joker.

He felt rather silly, but the performance seemed to be working. The human, one hand steadying its spin, looked on intensely.

<p><em>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid,&#8221;  Thargus said, meaning the opposite. He&#8217;d seen the trick on old films stored in the moss-brain when humans always said one thing and meant another like &#8220;We&#8217;re safer if we split up.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>The human exhaled a long stream of smoke. &#8220;I&#8217;m not,&#8221; it said.</em></p>
<p><em>That didn&#8217;t sound right. Thargus considered his response while staring at the human. It sure was ugly. A patchwork of dirty synthetics over the majority of its body, and on top of its pudgy, pink head, strand upon strand of greasy hair. Ugh!  Thargus felt sick.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Be afraid, then,&#8221; he said.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Why, are you going to eat me?&#8221;</em></p>

"Don't be afraid,"nbsp; Thargus said, meaning the opposite. He'd seen the trick on old films stored in the moss-brain when humans always said one thing and meant another like "We're safer if we split up."

The human exhaled a long stream of smoke. "I'm not," it said.

That didn't sound right. Thargus considered his response while staring at the human. It sure was ugly. A patchwork of dirty synthetics over the majority of its body, and on top of its pudgy, pink head, strand upon strand of greasy hair. Ugh!nbsp; Thargus felt sick.

"Be afraid, then," he said.

"Why, are you going to eat me?"

Thargus didn't feel comfortable telling an outright lie, but that didn't mean he needed to be too honest. "I might."

Rated F: for two f-bombs and some serious munchies.

<p><em>As the old man came in, letting the door close gently behind him, an expression came over his face that Garth had seen many times before: a compound of misty nostalgia and appalled astonishment.

Finally the old man&#8217;s eyes stopped dead on the smiling face of the six-foot-tall fiberglass cow that stood at the end of the counter, wearing an apron and a chef&#8217;s hat.  &#8220;My God,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s Moogle McDougal.&#8221;</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Cross posted from <a href="http://murverse.com/2010/05/07/new-escape-pod-editor-announced/">Murverse.com</a>:</em></p>
<p>I’ve been hinting at a seekrit project for a while now, and it’s finally public: Steve Eley, the brilliant mind behind the first podcast fiction magazine, is stepping down from <a href="http://escapepod.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Escape Pod</strong></a>, and I’ll be taking his place.</p>
<p>I’ve been involved with Escape Artists in one way or another several times in the past five years. Steve has published several of my short stories, and asked me and Ben Phillips to helm <a href="http://pseudopod.org/" target="_blank">Pseudopod</a> when it launched. I had to step down in 2007 because i had a day job and simply had to let some outside things go.</p>
<p>I’ve been working behind the scenes on the EP thing for a couple of weeks now, sifting through slush with some truly dedicated volunteers. We re-launch after our hiatus next week on Escape Pod’s fifth anniversary with Steve’s last podcast. Then I will take over hosting for three weeks, then we will run our traditional Hugo short story offering. July is when I’ll settle into the job fully with hosting and editing. We’ve got some new things coming up for the podcast this summer.</p>
<p>But never fear! The podcast is awesome because of Steve’s vision: fun SF, and I’ll never turn away from that.</p>
<p>I’ve got a great team helping me, and I’m very excited to see where we can steer this ship. Thanks for all the congrats that came through Twitter and email so far, it really means a lot to me that people have confidence in my ability to take this amazing podcast and keep it strong.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A message from Steve, posted on the forums:</p>
<hr />
<blockquote><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>This&#8217;ll be a short message, with a longer one later.  First things first: I am alive.  Family&#8217;s doing well, including Harper:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/30334780@N00/4503923699/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4040/4503923699_7875f0827c_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><P>There&#8217;s been a lot going on, but that&#8217;s a lousy excuse to be radio silent for this long.  I&#8217;m sorry about that.  This doesn&#8217;t justify it, but it&#8217;s symptomatic of one thing: I&#8217;ve been managing my energy poorly.  I&#8217;m being stretched too thin.</p>
<p><P>That warrants more explanation, and I&#8217;ll say more soon.  What I want you to know right now is that I&#8217;m going to be resigning from Escape Pod.  This isn&#8217;t actually a negative, although it probably sounds that way.  It&#8217;s the right thing to do for myself <em>and</em> it&#8217;s the right thing to do for the podcast.  There&#8217;s a plan in the works to bring new energy in &#8212; one or more people who will do better by you than I have lately.</p>
<p><P>Escape Pod won&#8217;t be going away.  I really do think the podcast matters.  The stories matter, and the audience matters.  And I&#8217;m not going to say you&#8217;ll never hear my voice again.  But I won&#8217;t be trying to keep everything on my shoulders.  That worked for a few years, and I felt I needed to keep coming back to it.  But I think you deserve better.  And we&#8217;re going to work to make sure you get it.</p>
<p><P>Whew.</p>
<p><P>So.  How&#8217;s things with you?</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Escape Pod will be back up and running May 12 (which, incidentally, is our 5 year anniversary/birthday/thingie). <strong>Also, we will be closed to submissions until July 1.</strong> If you do not hear from us by then, feel free to resubmit. </p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be announcing the new editor shortly, until then, thank you for your patience, your support, and your concern. </p>

ldquo;Thatrsquo;s very kind,rdquo; Etan said, ldquo;but I have called, and I donrsquo;t want to imposemdash;ldquo;

ldquo;It was my employerrsquo;s idea to stop, sir. I agreed, of course. My employer is quite fond of people. In fact, my employer loves people. And Irsquo;m sure you would be rewarded in some way.rdquo;

Rated R. Contains profanity and mature (if alien) themes.

<p><i>Turns out, you know, that old dharma bum never made it off the wheel of karma.  He had too many attachments, to the road, to words; and if you love the things of the world of Mara too much you fall back into the world, like gravity pulling back a rocket that doesn’t reach escape velocity.  Two, three thousand years later, he&#8217;s still on the road.  Really, nothing&#8217;s changed.  And Neal, that old prankster, Neal never really did want to transcend, he loved to see it all streaming past the window, a constant moving circus disappearing in the rear-view mirror, loved to talk, loved it all.</i></p>

<p>First appeared in <a href="http://www.asimovs.com">Asimov&#8217;s</a>, December 2002.</p>
<p><i>“They’re uploads, Jennifer.”  When I first met Mel, I thought the sleepy voice was sexy.  “How can they move in with us when they’re not anywhere?”</i></p>
<p><i>“They bought a puppet to live in,” I say.  “Life-sized, nuskin, real speak – top of the line.  It’s supposed to be my Christmas present.  Bring the family back together for the holidays and live unhappily ever after.”</i></p>
<p><i>“A puppet.” A puzzlement glyph pops up at the bottom of my screen.  “As in <b>one</b> puppet?”</i></p>
<p><i>“It’s a timeshare – you know.  They live it serially.  Ten hours of him, fourteen of her.”</i></p>
<p><i>“Not fifty-fifty?”</i></p>
<p><i>“He’s giving her the difference so he can take extra time off for his bass tournament in June.”</i></p>
<p><b>Rated PG.</b> Contains family drama and way too much sugar.</p>

This story originally appeared in Aeon #14.

The diner stood off the highway outside a small town optimistically called Hope. Hope was being stuck in the middle of the Northwest and wishing you were someplace, anyplace else. And Hope was also the name on the tag pinned to the dead woman in waitress uniforms that was currently lying against the wall inside the _Barbie-Q Roadhouse_. I had to stop myself from worrying at the connection: looking for patterns when sometimes there are none at all.

I wasn't worried about Hope (the waitress, not the town). I didn't get called down here for a murder: shit, murder is an honest-to-God American pastime. Just look at the statistics. No, I got called in because of the Marilyn.

The Marilyn was also dead. All in all, there were five dead people in the Barbie-Q: two waitresses; a balding man who ndash; from his bag full of cheaply-printed catalogues ndash; was some sort of a general salesman; the diner's manageress; and Marilyn. They had been shot by a machine gun, probably an Uzi. Marilyn's head left a red smear against the glass of the booth she sat in. She was there alone.

What the hell was a Marilyn doing out here?

<p><em>Flies buzzed around the edges of the huge stone block, gathering at the rivulets of blood that ran down to the floor. A bit of what looked like it might be intestine hung off one corner, drawing special attention. It was a testament to the force of the collision that fragments of bone and tissue were scattered all the way down the passage, some even wedged in the carvings in the stone walls. Two men surveyed the scene with dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;See? And this just keeps happening. It&#8217;s getting so we can&#8217;t get anything done around here,&#8221; said the taller of the two, a grey-haired man with red eyes and a patchy beard.</p>
<p>The other man, younger but not precisely young, hauled himself up on top of the block and examined the mechanism. &#8220;This bar&#8217;s been sliced right through.&#8221; He looked back down at his client. &#8220;You say this was a poltergeist?&#8221;</em><br />

Rated PG for some violence and language.</strong></p>

"See? And this just keeps happening. It's getting so we can't get anything done around here," said the taller of the two, a grey-haired man with red eyes and a patchy beard.

The other man, younger but not precisely young, hauled himself up on top of the block and examined the mechanism. "This bar's been sliced right through." He looked back down at his client. "You say this was a poltergeist?"
