			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boy, does it suck when everything goes horribly wrong. For 200 years, these dudes have been our friends, ever since we helped them make peace with these other dudes who were our friends even longer. But now they&#8217;re all pissed at us. So let&#8217;s send our most awesome dude to their house and hold a giant party, inviting everyone. That&#8217;ll totally work! Until the few asshats who kind-of-sort-of know these friendly dudes&#8217; roommate call in all their asshat friends and start throwing down.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty much the entire plot of <em>Star Trek: Typhon Pact #4: Paths of Disharmony</em>. Also known as the one with Captain Picard and the dreadlocked Andorian on the front cover.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/eablog_pod_ward.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1904" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/eablog_pod_ward-184x300.jpg" alt="" width="184" height="300" /></a>In all honesty, this is quite possibly the best of the Typhon Pact novels so far, and I&#8217;m not really surprised at that. It&#8217;s the most popular ship and crew in <em>Star Trek</em>, plus a race that has really gotten kind of short shrift in televised <em>Trek</em> (<em>Enterprise</em> notwithstanding), plus a classic <em>Trek</em> &#8220;let&#8217;s go to a planet and solve a problem&#8221; episode. It&#8217;s written by Dayton Ward, who has done some really great <em>Trek</em> writing over the years. And, of all the <em>Trek</em> tie-ins written since the end of <em>Voyager</em>, this one brings together the largest amount of the most popular crew (four-sevenths of the central TNG cast).</p>
<p><em>Paths</em> begins with the <em>Enterprise</em> being sent to Andor, a staunch Federation member for more than 200 years, because their people are up in arms that genetic research is being done to help them find ways to reproduce that don&#8217;t involve four distinct sexes. Lieutenant Thirishar ch&#8217;Thane, late of the Deep Space Nine relaunch, is a part of that team. Support on Andor is turning against the Federation, and the Andorian presider hopes a scientific conference will be the answer. Like I said, pretty standard TNG at this point.</p>
<p>Aboard the <em>Enterprise</em>, we find Picard, Beverly, their son Rene (who is now one year old), Worf, and Geordi. Added to their number are science officer Elfiki, contact specialist (and somewhat annoyingly Mary-Sue-ish<a href="#jr_chen">*</a>) T&#8217;Ryssa Chen, security chief (and Worf-squeeze) Jasminder Choudhury, assistant chief engineer Taurik, and ship&#8217;s counselor Hegol Den. Picard is mentally battling with himself as to whether or not he should take a promotion to Admiral (or even Ambassador), and he and Beverly are definitely looking to make things a little more stable for their son. Geordi is having love issues (a common theme for him). And everyone is worried about the Typhon Pact.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at Andor, the crew splits up into their traditional small groups &#8212; Picard does some diplomacy and is enticed to visit an archaelogical dig; Beverly works with the genetic scientist who caused all this trouble; Geordi builds a power station; Choudhury has to secure the conference building; and up on the ship, Worf is left in charge. Through all of this we meet many secondary Andorian characters, as well as a lot of enterprising young men (and women) &#8212; mostly in security. About 40 percent into the book, a rebel group of Andorians strikes at the Federation personnel, but it&#8217;s not until halfway through &#8212; the traditional cliffhanger point &#8212; that we see who&#8217;s really behind all of this anti-Federation settlement.</p>
<p>As one would expect, after the Typhon Pact drops a bombshell that shakes the Andorian people&#8217;s trust in the Federation, the true villains make a series of attacks somewhat reminiscent of the Picard-on-the-surface-Riker-on-the-ship that we saw in <em>Insurrection</em>. Our heroes must stop these terrorists.</p>
<p>You can guess how that turns out.</p>
<p>In exactly the same way that <em>Rough Beasts of Empire</em> didn&#8217;t, <em>Paths of Disharmony</em> manages to make me care about all the secondary (and even the minor) characters enough that I didn&#8217;t get lost when we jumped from place to place. With the exception of a huge digression (Picard&#8217;s archaeological trip, which seemed to me to be an excuse to tie in <em>Enterprise</em>), the writing is well-paced and the action is gripping.</p>
<p>I know there are at least two more Typhon Pact books in the offing, but they&#8217;ll be hard-pressed to top this one. Definitely worth it, for both casual and die-hard <em>Star Trek</em> fans who are looking for the next chapter in the lives of our <em>Next Generation</em> friends.</p>
<p><a name="jr_chen">*</a> <em>I don&#8217;t blame Ward; he didn&#8217;t invent the character, and he actually gives her some respectable things to do in this episode.</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Quick note: Sorry it&#8217;s late folks, minor illness-related delays.</p>
<p>The ePub version can be found <a href="http://traffic.libsyn.com/escapepod/Soundproof5.epub">here</a>.</p>
<p>To our readers—</p>
<p>I’ve always been of two minds about that proverb (well, curse) that has been attributed to the ancient Chi- nese of “May you live in interesting times.”</p>
<p>Because let’s face it, boring times are getting further apart and fewer. The era of the noble farmer living a quiet life on the plains is long dead in much of the developed world, and while we always dream of re- turning home to a quiet Ithaca, I think a lot of us prefer the torrents of the seas and not knowing what the next isle will bring.</p>
<p>Which is bit of a long way of saying that it was a bit of a crazy month last month, wasn’t it?</p>
<p>Thousands of much better words than these have been etched in the cyber on the wave of popular revolu- tions in North Africa and the Middle East, so I’m going talk about the impending end of the Space Shuttle program.</p>
<p>Space shuttles were always a bit of science fiction that existed in the real world for those of us who grew up after the space race. They were the oddly shaped white space ships in the toy box with the X and Y- Wings and variants of the Enterprise.</p>
<p>They mixed the aspiration of escape from the bonds of gravity with the weight of tragedy that such aspira- tion can lead to. They were something between a pickup truck and the first real wave of space colonizers. Not that the two are mutually exclusive</p>
<p>The third to last shuttle mission is skimming the stratosphere as I write this, and the last one is due to launch in June. And then the US civilian space program will be reliant on private sector for space vehicles until at least 2015. Which, in a way, is progress.</p>
<p>But progress that doesn’t quite sit right. You want commercial haulers out there making space civilized, useful, and cheap enough that you might be able to hop out there for less than a decade’s salary. But there’s a need for ships of the line, and those come from the public masses.</p>
<p>Last month, Escape Pod brought you four stories, two of which will be republished here. Unfortunately we bought EP279: Conditional Love just before we started asking for ePub rights, as it was just nominated for the Nebula. Escape Pod knows all, but not always at the right time.</p>
<p>But we are bringing you the excellent David D. Levine’s Written On The Wind and the quite interesting Alex Dally MacFarlane’s The Notebook of My Favorite Skin-Trees. One’s about a bunch of aliens living together, mostly in peace, and the other’s about advertising in the near future.</p>
<p>We also did something a little special with the Written On The Wind episode, and you can read about it in the back of this month’s Soundproof.<br />
Yours,<br />
—Bill</p>

		<description><![CDATA[We love Spock. We love Sisko. But will we love them in the same book at the same time? A review of David R. George III's <i>Rough Beasts of Empire</i> reveals that... well... we won't.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m really hoping that the <em>Star Trek</em> Typhon Pact tie-in novels aren&#8217;t going to suffer from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_%28film_series%29#Curse">odd-numbered curse</a> all the way through, because I don&#8217;t think I can handle spending another $8 on book five if it&#8217;s going to be as disappointing as <em>Rough Beasts of Empire</em>, the third book in the saga.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ea_rboe.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1885" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ea_rboe-186x300.jpg" alt="" width="186" height="300" /></a>I had really hoped <em>Empire</em> would be great. After all, the author, David R. George III, wrote what was to my mind the best installment in the Lost Era, <em>Serpents Among the Ruins</em> (if you like <em>Trek</em> and you haven&#8217;t read it, you should rectify that situation immediately). George has also written other very enjoyable books in the <em>Trek</em> universe. But, unfortunately, this Typhon Pact novel just doesn&#8217;t cut it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m usually a fan of multiple interlocking stories that come together at the end. I even liked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_actually">Love Actually</a>, despite the extremely-tangential way some of the storylines touched each other. But compared to <em>Empire</em>, that film&#8217;s stories were completely intertwined.</p>
<p>There are four distinct stories in <em>Empire</em>, and the only way to explain them is to keep them separate, like they are in the novel.</p>
<p><strong>The Tzenkethi.</strong> As with the other Typhon Pact novels, <em>Empire</em> exists to show us a <em>Star Trek</em> race that we haven&#8217;t seen. The Tzenkethi are a merit-driven caste society of beautiful beings with no bones and a very unique approach to the use of floor (and ceiling) space. Their names are so complex that I can&#8217;t even remember what the main Tzenkethi character was called. Something with an A at the end. Anyway, this Tzenkethi was sent to be the Typhon Pact&#8217;s ambassador to Romulus, although she had a secret mission. Which was addressed so infrequently that I totally forgot about it until the very end.</p>
<p><strong>Vulcan-Romulan Reunification.</strong> Spock is still on Romulus, trying to bring both sides together. This was by far the least interesting of all the storylines because, (a), we&#8217;ve been dealing with it in novels for far too long and, (b), we know it&#8217;s never going to succeed. It&#8217;s just an excuse to get a picture of Leonard Nimoy on the cover of the book. In any case, an assassination attempt is made upon Spock, which leads him to approach Praetor Tal&#8217;Aura<a href="#jr_tal">*</a> with a groundbreaking proposal.</p>
<p><strong>The Romulan Senate.</strong> The Ortikant family, led by Gell Kamemor<a href="#jr_gell">**</a>, is heavily involved in the reformation of the Romulan Senate under Tal&#8217;Aura.</p>
<p><strong>Captain Sisko.</strong> I firmly believe that this is the story George wanted to tell when he started writing this book. It is the most interesting, the most nuanced, and the most compelling. In the beginning, we see Sisko commanding the starship <em>New York</em> during the Borg war in <em>Star Trek: Destiny</em>. This actually happens before the first two Typhon Pact novels, which confused me at first, but I got over it. Anyway, after the battle, Sisko goes home to Kasidy and his family, but remembers that the Prophets told him he would only know sadness if he made a life for himself on Bajor. So he makes the questionable decision to leave Bajor and return to Starfleet. He is assigned a starship on patrol along the Romulan border, where he becomes Emo Sisko.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also several minor sub-plots, including the return of a somewhat-overused-as-a-plot-device character, the summit between Empress Donatra and Praetor Tal&#8217;Aura, the observations of Senator Durjik, and an out-of-nowhere flashback to Sisko&#8217;s experiences during the last Tzenkethi conflict which completely pulled me out of the story.</p>
<p>The plots above only barely touch, and I don&#8217;t feel as though they were adequately tied together (especially Sisko&#8217;s, which only very slightly interacted with any of the others). I really feel this is two books &#8212; Sisko&#8217;s story, and the Romulan story. Unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t really get into the Romulan story because it was too boring, and I couldn&#8217;t really get into the Sisko story because I can&#8217;t believe that Sisko would walk away from his family just because the Prophets told him to. I can think of at least three better ways to get Sisko into the story, and I&#8217;m probably not the only <em>Trek</em> fan who read &#8220;reunification&#8221; and thought &#8220;oy vey, enough already.&#8221;</p>
<p>I realize I&#8217;ve been pretty negative overall, but mostly what I&#8217;m negative about is the plot and the story. George&#8217;s writing is still top-notch, even when he&#8217;s dumping scads of exposition, and as with the other Typhon Pact novels there are plenty of hooks into other <em>Star Trek</em> shows and books that fans will remember and recognize. I just don&#8217;t think this book was interlaced enough with its A and B plots to really interest me; therefore, I&#8217;ll have to recommend that you give this one a pass and just read the spoilers online.</p>
<p><a name="jr_tal">*</a> <em>You may remember her from </em>Star Trek: Nemesis<em> as the Romulan woman who left the Senate chamber just before everyone turned into stones and crumbled to dust.</em></p>
<p><a name="jr_gell">*</a> <em>See </em>Serpents Among the Ruins<em>, where she was the chief Romulan negotiator on the Treaty of Algeron, best known for preventing the Federation from developing or using cloaking devices.</em></p>

<p><strong>The Notebook of my Favourite Skin-Trees</strong><br />
By Alex Dally MacFarlane</p>
<p>BANANA</p>
<p>The best part of these are the fruits, growing on their fat stem, dangling down the person’s back or from their arm. I always bow and smile, asking, “Can I taste one of your fruits? Bananas from a skin-tree are so sweet.”</p>
<p>So sweet and so small, a single mouthful.</p>
<p>I also enjoy the place where banana tree meets flesh, roots curving over and into the person’s limb &#8212; pressing my lips there, my tongue &#8212; and the small shade cast by the leaves.</p>

<p>Kim Cuc saw advertisements everywhere she looked in the walking street market, but only on the leaves of the skin-trees: names of shops and cafés and restaurants spelled out, Thai or English or other languages, in the bright white veins. Aside from the occasional cry from stall owners or vendors &#8212; “I have the finest grilled bananas in Chiang Mai! Come and taste!” &#8212; no other form of promotion cluttered the senses.</p>
<p>That had always been the intent of the skin-trees’ engineers and earliest supporters. Kim Cuc smiled often, seeing the remains of once-garishly lit billboards, or walls that several years earlier would have been covered in paper.</p>
<p>No smiles on this night.</p>
<p>She stopped every person with a skin-tree in the walking street market, to ask if they’d noticed strange discolourations on their leaves. “There is a sickness,” she said, putting urgency into the phrase she now knew in many languages, not just her native Vietnamese and second tongue English, “and it’s important to collect samples and data.” Into one of the notebooks carried under her arm, she noted the age and ethnicity of the person, the age and species of their tree, the company its leaves advertised &#8212; this for those whose trees remained healthy. In a second notebook, with frowning lizards on the spine, she noted the same information for those whose trees were not. There she added information about the duration of the discolourations, their colour and spread. Samples went into a third notebook, with little clips to fasten two pages together, and special paper to protect and preserve the leaves.</p>
<p>The lizard-spined notebook was not as full as the first, yet.</p>
<p>Late in the night, when vendors began packing away their wares, Kim Cuc followed the shoppers returning to their homes. She drank from the large bottle of nutrient-full water she always carried around. The durian tree growing on her left shoulder needed it.</p>
<p>She passed a stall selling Buddha-shaped lanterns, a popular tourist item. Some still glowed, yellowly and redly, and in their light she glanced at her durian. A brown circle, no greater in circumference than a joss stick, lay on the edge of one leaf.</p>
<p>“No!” she cried out.</p>
<p>The bright screen of her wrist-computer did not contradict the Buddha lights.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>BANYAN</p>
<p>The banyan’s thick roots suggest a secret fluidity, like wax, uncommon to plants: frozen over Pitsamai’s shoulder, beginning where bone used to jut from her thin flesh, sliding down her shoulder blades, curling around her upper arm (carefully trained not to restrict movement), stretching across her collarbone and down her breastbone, down the neat lines of her ribs. They frame her right breast. I always think they will flow when Pitsamai is alone, even though she tells me this isn’t the case.</p>
<p>The thick leaves advertise Chiang Mai University. Veins curl in the letters in Thai and English, artificially white against dark green. Pitsamai loves her university.</p>
<p>The tangled trunks rise from her shoulder, as tall as her forehead. Aerial roots dangle from its branches, always reminding me of hair (sometimes tangling with Pitsamai’s hair), and they are my favourite part. I always tilt my head when I kiss Pitsamai’s lips, so the aerial roots brush my cheek. When I kiss the base of the tree, that special place where root is fixed to flesh, the aerial roots tangle in my hair.</p>
<p>I considered, years ago when no skin-tree grew on me, acquiring a banyan. Perhaps it’s retained its allure because I have to be with Pitsamai or another of my girlfriends to enjoy it: a double pleasure, like spicy meat inside a rice ball.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>“I am worried,” Pitsamai, biological engineer at Chiang Mai University, said in English.</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t say that!”</p>
<p>The previous night, Kim Cuc had torn off the infected leaf and fastened it in her third notebook. She’d written in the lizard-spined one, summarising this latest infection. By the light of glowing Buddhas, she’d wiped the tears from her cheeks and pretended the sickness was only a small thing, a two-hour stomach upset among the skin-trees.</p>
<p>The look on Pitsamai’s face when she took the leaf from Kim Cuc’s notebook ended that flimsy lie.</p>
<p>They stood on the edge of Pitsamai’s lab, where the Asian skin-trees had been created. Behind them were rows of tables, glass equipment, remote-controlled machines that tended to the cultures and plants in secure and biohazard cabinets. One of Pitsamai’s colleagues sat at a table, inputting data to a computer. Graphs arced across its screen.</p>
<p>Several specimens in the cabinets &#8212; skin-trees grafted to synthetic limbs &#8212; bore the dark marks of the disease.</p>
<p>“It’s beginning to spread very quickly,” Pitsamai said, “and in many parts of the world. Örn is seeing them in Iceland now. Neroly in Venice has begun a clinic, and noticed a dramatic rise two days ago &#8212; partly due to people only just hearing about the clinic, only just getting concerned, but many were new. This afternoon I v-chatted to one of the first cases in Australia. Half the leaves on his tree are brown and shrivelling. I think the skin-trees will die from this.”</p>
<p>Skin-trees were not meant to do that before the person’s death.</p>
<p>Kim Cuc played with the amulet at her throat, hating the nausea that wriggled in her belly like a troublesome naga. “What more can I do to help?”</p>
<p>“Keep collecting samples for me. Talk to some of the older cases in your notebook.” Pitsamai tangled her fingers into Kim Cuc’s. “I know it will be hard, seeing their trees so ill, but I need to know if any of them have managed to</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I haven’t posted here as much as I should, and hope to alter that in the next few weeks. There are things I know I should be writing about (Like, for example, Fringe. Which is a great, great SciFi show. It has heart and a parallel universe and an ancient and mysterious machine.)</p>
<p>But I’m breaking my silence today to relate onto thee, treasured listener, of a really cool thing I was able to facilitate the weekend before last.</p>
<p>A little bit back I got an email from Susan (aka Georgia), who lives in Washington, D.C. with her boyfriend Christie (aka Xie). (Yes, boyfriend. As Susan explained in an early email, “Australians have flexible ideas on what counts as a dude&#8217;s name.”)</p>
<p>Like many people who email me, she is a fan of Escape Pod. Unlike many¹ people who email me, she wanted Escape Pod’s help asking her boyfriend, Christie, to marry her.</p>
<p>They listen to Escape Pod together, and apparently Steve Eley fills a void in Christie’s life that others of us fill with Dan Savage or Dear Prudence. The relationship advice columnist void. Get your mind out of the gutter treasured listener.</p>
<p>So we did it, and awoke Steve from his deep slumber. And I spliced it quickly into a copy of EP278 Written On the Wind and sent our favorite robot speeding her way with it.</p>
<p>The text is below, but I&#8217;m sure many of you would prefer listening to Steve read it, so <a href="http://traffic.libsyn.com/escapepod/Proposal.mp3">click here</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Hi, this is Steve Eley.  Rising from the deep for a special announcement.  There&#8217;s a lot going on in the world, but some things are more important than others.  Some of the most important things involve just two people.  Could be any two people, but let&#8217;s say two people from the United States and Australia.  Let&#8217;s say these two people are in love.  There&#8217;s almost nothing more important than that.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">They&#8217;d have a lot of challenges, these two people.  They&#8217;d spend a lot of time on planes.  They&#8217;re in love, so it&#8217;s worth it.  And maybe they listen to Escape Pod on the plane.  Maybe when they&#8217;re together, they listen to Escape Pod together, too.  Making dinner, or walking the kitten.  It&#8217;s clearly not the most important thing, but anything two people do together can be special.  And if one of those two people asks us to help, with the most important question &#8212; that&#8217;s VERY special.  It&#8217;s special enough to bring me up out of retirement.  But what&#8217;s special is what you two have.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So.  Christie.  I&#8217;m talking to you.  Georgia wants to know: will you marry her?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We now return you to your regularly scheduled outro.  Have Fun &#8212; and I _hope_ you say yes.</p>
<p>And as Susan emailed me soon after:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He said yes. <img src='http://escapepod.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  (Or rather&#8230; &#8220;Well if Steve Eley thinks I should, then of course I will!&#8221;)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Thank you so much. And give my thanks to every else too!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And Xie say thanks as well. He didn&#8217;t see it coming&#8230; He kept saying &#8220;that&#8217;s just like us!&#8221; until, finally, he realized it <em>was</em> us.</p>
<div>And we&#8217;re very happy for them both. Best of luck you pair of really hoopy froods.</div>
<div></div>
<p>¹Really, everyone else. So far.</p>

ldquo;Just curious if my campaign had had any effect,rdquo; Minerva said, nodding  toward the window.nbsp; The billboard across from the Gene-Engineered  Pediatric Inpatient Center flashed a smog warning, then a PSA about eye  strain from computer visors, but Grace remembered when it had borne a  static image:nbsp; Minnie, one year old, a pink sundress exposing the stubs  of her arms and legs.nbsp; _Babies should be born, not made._nbsp; The ad had  stayed up until Minnie was eight, three years after her parents turned  her over to GEPIC, and apparently she had seen it.nbsp; She was twelve now,  with serious eyes and a loose ponytail, dark blonde. </itunes:summary>

		<description><![CDATA[After the demise of the Borg, our Star Trek heroes needed a new Big Boss to fight. So the editors gave us the Typhon Pact. "Zero Sum Game" is the first in the miniseries, and... well, I'm a little disappointed.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the summer of 1988, my mom picked my sister and me up from our summer camp and said that my dad had gotten hurt at work (his foot) and was in the hospital. We were going to go see him, but since we&#8217;d be there for a while, she&#8217;d take us to the bookstore first. I remember picking out a book, and then on the way to the front, I noticed a whole shelf of <i>Star <i>Trek</i></i> novels. I grabbed the one with the coolest cover.</p>
<p>That was my first exposure to non-YA genre fiction. The book was Diane Duane&#8217;s <i>My Enemy, My Ally</i>, still one of my favorites.</p>
<p>Since then, I have read hundreds of <i>Star <i>Trek</i></i> novels across all five series. I used to read every single one, but now I pick and choose. I&#8217;ve been pretty judicious lately. However, I decided I&#8217;d give the Typhon Pact novels a try, and started with the first one, David Mack&#8217;s <i>Zero Sum Game</i>.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ea-zsg.jpg"><img src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ea-zsg-185x300.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1845" /></a>Although marketed as a Typhon Pact novel, <i>Zero Sum Game</i> is really a DS9 book at its heart. It also kind of requires that you&#8217;ve read the <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Destiny">Destiny trilogy</a> so you know about the characters, and that you&#8217;re at least aware of the events in Keith R.A. DeCandido&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Star-Trek-Generation-Singular-Destiny/dp/1416594957/ref=sr_1_21?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1297003755&amp;sr=8-21">A Singular Destiny</a> (read the spoilers; I found the book kind of boring and Mary-Sue-ish). For those who aren&#8217;t: Ezri Dax is now the captain of the starship <i>Aventine</i>, and her crew contains folks from DS9 and TNG &#8212; including <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Simon_Tarses">Simon Tarses</a>. The Typhon Pact is a group of traditional <i>Trek</i> enemies that formed in the wake of the Borg invasion chronicled in Destiny; it includes the Romulans, the Tholians, the Gorn, the Breen, the Kinshaya, and the Tzenkethi. I seem to remember the reason for their creation as being pretty flimsy, but that&#8217;s neither here nor there. It seems as though the Typhon Pact novels are going to humanize <i>Trek</i> enemies who haven&#8217;t gotten a lot of play over the years. First up, the Breen, who speak in machine language and whose faces have never been seen. In the DS9 years, the Breen allied themselves with the Dominion, and that&#8217;s really about all you need to know. </p>
<p>In <i>Zero Sum Game</i>, Starfleet Intelligence has learned that the Breen are developing a slipstream drive to rival the Federation&#8217;s fastest propulsion technology, which is installed aboard the <i>Aventine</i>. Dr. Bashir, who has done a few missions for SI in the past, is tapped to infiltrate the Breen because he is genetically-enhanced, thereby giving him the ability to learn, process, and react faster than your average SI agent. His briefing is conducted by the other enhanced individuals Bashir met during DS9, including Sarina Douglas, with whom he&#8217;d fallen in love at one point. He agrees to go on the mission, with Douglas as his partner, and after an overly-convoluted plan to get them inserted into Breen space on the correct planet, they get their &#8212; and every <i>Trek</i> fan&#8217;s &#8212; first view of what the Breen are really like.</p>
<p>And that is, by far, the best part of the book. Not the action sequences, not the narrow escapes from death, not the way Douglas overcomes her captors or Bashir fights moral battles with himself over killing, and definitely not the B-plot of Dax trying to keep the <i>Aventine</i> on the Breen border so they can pick up Bashir and Douglas when their mission is complete. All of the plot and action is average <i>Trek</i>, and there&#8217;s actually quite a lot of improbable goings-on that seem to work out perfectly for our heroes. Even the ending is pretty unbelievable, and the coda wasn&#8217;t as surprising (to me, anyway), as I think it was intended to be.</p>
<p>But the Breen&#8230; ah, the Breen. I&#8217;d hate to spoil it all by saying everything Mack came up with to make them interesting, but the reason they really wear those masks and armor is almost worth the price of admission. As with many <i>Trek</i> novels, there&#8217;s plenty of space to explain and describe things that just can&#8217;t be covered in a television episode, and Bashir and Douglas&#8217;s mission to the Breen world is enough to fill a couple of episodes by itself.</p>
<p>The novel is $8, whether it&#8217;s electronic or paper, and I&#8217;m quite pleased that Mack writes such long stories because there&#8217;s almost nothing that annoys me more than paying $8 for something that&#8217;s only 225 pages with large print and big spaces between the lines. While all Kindle books use more or less the same font size and kerning, <i>Zero Sum Game</i> is 352 pages in print, so I definitely didn&#8217;t feel cheated by paying $8 for it. However, after the heart-wrenching character deaths in <i>SCE: Wildfire</i> and the sweeping grandness of <i>Destiny</i> &#8212; probably the best cross-series saga available in the <i>Trek</i> universe &#8212; I felt a little let down by <i>Zero Sum Game</i>. I&#8217;ll still read Mack&#8217;s next book, because he can easily reach the bar he set with <i>Destiny</i>, but I don&#8217;t feel as though I <i>needed</i> to read this novel the way I needed to read <i>Destiny</i> or <i>Invasion</i> or <i>The Lost Era</i>.</p>
<p>A few last words on the Typhon Pact miniseries: I happen to be the kind of person who can&#8217;t stop reading a series once it&#8217;s started, so I&#8217;ve already bought the second in the miniseries. It&#8217;s the <i>Titan</i> entry, and I happen to enjoy the <i>Titan</i> novels &#8212; they seem to have taken the mantle of the single-episode novel that TNG and TOS used to have, back in the day. I also understand the concept of needing a Big Boss now that the Borg are out of the picture. I even understand wanting to show us the <i>Trek</i> races we don&#8217;t know very well and humanizing them so we sympathize. But I&#8217;m not sure the Typhon Pact is a credible enough enemy, and I don&#8217;t fear them the way I feared the Borg or the Romulans. Where these books will shine is the exploration of the lesser-known enemy races, and also in the interactions between characters. Mack wrote Dax&#8217;s crew as a cohesive unit, and I don&#8217;t remember if he invented Lieutenant Kedair but she is definitely an interesting addition to the cast; the way he showed us the Breen was also quite well-done. So far in Book 2, I&#8217;m learning quite a bit about the Gorn. </p>
<p>I think my problem is that I&#8217;m just not as excited about these books as I was for <i>Destiny</i>, or for new entries in <i>New Frontier</i>, or even for stand-alone <i>Trek</i> novels like in the 90s and early 2000s. And I think that really does a disservice to both <i>Star Trek</i> and to the novelists they&#8217;ve tapped to write these books &#8212; Mack, Michael A. Martin, David R. George III, and Dayton Ward, who have written some really great <i>Star Trek</i> fiction in the past. Perhaps when taken as a whole, after I&#8217;ve read them all, the Typhon Pact miniseries will feel like a complete storyline and I&#8217;ll feel better about recommending the entire series. But not yet.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Though Del Rey released the <i>Kraken</i> in the US last summer, I've only now gotten around to reading it. And as far as I can remember, no one in the book makes a <i>Clash of the Titans</i> reference. Anywhere.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When China Mieville&#8217;s <em>The Scar</em> &#8212; still my favorite book of his &#8212; came out, I was working for an over-the-air sci-fi-themed radio show which shall remain nameless. They booked an interview with Mieville, and as the board-op, I called him (I&#8217;m guessing at his hotel in Los Angeles or wherever he was), thanked him for being on the show, and potted him up when it was time for him to go on. The hosts talked to him about the novel, which was noteworthy to them I guess because it had a vampire in it. After about 15 minutes, they thanked him, and it was over<a href="#jr_scarint">*</a>.</p>
<p>Mieville&#8217;s latest novel, <em>Kraken</em>, is about a giant squid in the same way <em>The Scar</em> is about a vampire.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ea_kraken.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1786" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ea_kraken-196x300.jpg" alt="" width="196" height="300" /></a><em>Kraken</em> is an extremely difficult book to summarize; Mieville&#8217;s plots often are. So instead I&#8217;m going to link you to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/may/15/china-mieville-kraken-novel">this review by The Guardian</a>. Their one-sentence precis is quite masterful:</p>
<blockquote><p>Following the quest of museum curator Billy Harrow to recover his mysteriously vanished prize exhibit, the giant squid Architeuthis, Kraken plunges Billy and the reader into an alternative London of cults and magic.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that you know that, here&#8217;s what I liked (and didn&#8217;t) about the book:</p>
<p>When I first started reading the novel, I have to say I was &#8212; quite sadly &#8212; disappointed. Not with the content or the ideas, but with what I perceived to be the novel&#8217;s generic nature. It had many of the hallmarks of a fantasy story, and while each element was quite interesting&#8230; well, a $1000 hamburger at a gourmet restaurant still looks like a hamburger. To wit:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main character, Billy Harrow, is about 30, intelligent, a little geeky (but not too much), and non-violent. Stuff happens to him. Eventually he takes control of that stuff.</li>
<li>Dane is a guard who is the key to the world of weird, and while our MC didn&#8217;t like him at first, it turns out he&#8217;s quite an important character.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s a trio of policemen who want Billy to work for them, and they come off kind of like Smith in the first <em>Matrix</em>, but it turns out that, hey, they&#8217;re not all bad.</li>
<li>Wisecracking female cop who knows more than her colleagues? Check.</li>
<li>Small god who is very helpful but can&#8217;t actually <em>do</em> anything.</li>
<li>This is the big one, the one that really ripped it for me: while the Big Bad Guys are the usual sort, it seems like most urban (or regular) fantasy contains two guys who speak with a funny patois or patter to their speech, are ruthless, love their jobs, and are feared by everyone. Yep. They&#8217;re totally there. And they commit murder and inventively-violent ways which, to me, seemed far too over-the-top even for Mieville, who, in the past, has had the arms of a dead child grafted onto its mother&#8217;s face as a form of punishment.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the first 100 pages or so, I got into the swing of things and the generic feel of the characters went away. The use of conventions makes sense &#8212; it allows a fantasy reader to jump right into the world through the use of familiar characters, and casual readers are able to map character types onto the kind of characters they&#8217;re used to in, say, political thrillers or romantic comedies, thereby making what is often a very tough book to read just slightly easier.</p>
<p>And make no mistake: this isn&#8217;t the easiest book in the world to read. Mieville knows a lot of words, and he makes no bones about using them all &#8212; and not just in the order you&#8217;re used to. His writing is almost gymnastic in nature, and it forces you to pay attention to every bit of it in order to ensure you don&#8217;t miss anything. It&#8217;s really tough on those of us who are quick readers. He also continues to use very visceral and phantasmagoric verbal imagery &#8212; something I noticed in the New Crobuzon books &#8212; and, while it adds strength to the storytelling, sometimes it just gets tiring to have to think so hard about the words, instead of what they&#8217;re saying. (For example, when the Final Boss is revealed, and the monologue is given, I had trouble remembering the various clues that were given throughout the rest of the story as the Final Boss explained them.) I don&#8217;t mind working hard to read a book, but it can be too much from time to time.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the book&#8217;s humor and genre awareness &#8212; for example: if you give a <em>Star Trek</em> fan the magical power to teleport, of <em>course</em> he&#8217;s going to beam everywhere he can. And speaking of <em>Trek</em>, one of Billy&#8217;s primary weapons throughout the novel is his phaser. It really works. In some places, Mieville basically says &#8220;yeah, this genre convention is crap, here&#8217;s how it <em>really</em> is when a magical practitioner does it&#8221;. That works too. One of his strengths is that every little bit of the world is fully-realized, which means the novel is packed full of little moments of win.</p>
<p>Also on the positive column is the sheer amount of cool and different powers the denizens of London possess. Smoking reality, teleportation, burning something so thoroughly it never even existed, creating a demonically-possessed iPod&#8230; there are dozens, and they&#8217;re all interesting. As are the end-of-the-world cults and the weird religions, the Embassy of the Sea, and the penultimate Boss Fight (think Jenova, with the final boss being Sephiroth).</p>
<p><em>Kraken</em> is Mieville at his creative best, building a detailed and immersive world with a complex and layered plot that &#8212; in this case, quite literally &#8212; could mean the end of the world. The novel certainly has its flaws, as I noted above, but it&#8217;s definitely a good story, exciting and enjoyable to read. It&#8217;s no <em>The Scar</em>, but I think it&#8217;s a better book than <em>The City and The City</em> (which I didn&#8217;t really enjoy that much). I for one would&#8217;ve preferred another visit to New Crobuzon, but this is almost as good.</p>
<p>So, if this book&#8217;s just sitting on your bookshelf, gathering dust, perhaps it&#8217;s time to &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8211; oh, yes, I&#8217;m going there &#8211;</p>
<p><strong>RELEASE THE <em>KRAKEN</em>!</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://dogs.icanhascheezburger.com/2010/08/03/funny-dog-pictures-kraken/"><img src="http://ihasahotdog.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/129160173034145959.jpg" alt="funny dog pictures-Release the Kraken!" /></a></p>
<p><a name="jr_scarint">*</a> <em>One would think the guy who had actually </em>read<em> the first novel in the New Crobuzon cycle might have helped in the prep for the interview. But that didn&#8217;t happen. If only I&#8217;d known how big a fan of Mieville&#8217;s I&#8217;d become, I&#8217;d have gotten in on the ground floor there.</em></p>

<p><strong>Written on the Wind</strong><br />
by David D. Levine</p>
<p>Thuren Nektopk peered down at Luulianni from above his massive desk.  &#8220;I suspect you know why I&#8217;ve called you to speak with me in person.&#8221;  He spoke in his native language, Ptopku Dominant, using the form of address for a subordinate or a child.  It was a constant reminder that the Ptopku had built and largely staffed this station, and was one of the most powerful species in the Consortium.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Supervisor,&#8221; Luulianni replied in the same language, knotting her tentacles.  </p>
<p>&#8220;And that would be&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of my side project.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;  Nektopk suddenly released the bar from which he hung, caught himself on another handhold, and with two swift strokes of his arms swung down to where his six slitted eyes were level with Luulianni&#8217;s.  &#8220;Your little side project.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Luulianni cringed.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand why it&#8217;s so much of a problem.&#8221;  She straightened and tried to meet his gaze.  &#8220;I put in my full quota of time every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you do, and not one moment more.  But I know you are capable of so much more than that.  Any work you do on this pointless little side project of yours constitutes theft of resources from the Section &#8212; from the whole Project!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Theft?&#8221; she squeaked.  Angry at herself for the loss of control, she brought her voice down.  &#8220;Theft of resources?  But I don&#8217;t use any data storage space, or any other Section resources!  I write my notes on the backs of old printouts.&#8221;  She did not mention how much more natural it felt to work on paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are stealing the most valuable resource of all!&#8221;  Nektopk pointed at her with one limber foot.  &#8220;Your own time and attention!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s my time!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been sent here by your people &#8212; at considerable expense, I might add &#8212; to assist in the Project, to learn the ways of the Consortium, and to demonstrate your species&#8217; unique skills.&#8221;  He leaned closer to her.  His smell was bitter.  &#8220;And if I find that your species, as represented by yourself, does not demonstrate any unique skills, your application for Consortium membership could very well be denied.&#8221;  He swung himself up to the edge of his desk, the better to glare down at her.  &#8220;Therefore, your time is not your own.  You owe it to the Section, to the Project, and to your own people to put every bit of available time into your assigned task.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luulianni hung her head.  &#8220;Yes, Supervisor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may return to your work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Supervisor.&#8221;<br />
<em><br />
<a href="http://escapepod.org/2011/02/03/ep278-written-on-the-wind/">Read More&#8230;</a></em><br />
<span id="more-1832"></span><br />
#</p>
<p>Luulianni&#8217;s scales prickled with anger as she made her way back to her workspace.  If she was to demonstrate her unique skills, why did he not listen to her ideas?  And if her time was so valuable, why did Nektopk insist that she come to his office, halfway across the station, rather than using the screen?  </p>
<p>She straightened her shoulders and forced herself to walk down the middle of the corridor.  The Muuli were a burrowing species; her instinct was to cling to the wall, to hide from the harsh, bluish light and the Ptopku swinging from handhold to handhold far above.  Luulianni consoled herself that some day her people would build their own stations in space, with low ceilings and narrow corridors.  They would be dark, and warm, and smell of dirt and of many long-nosed Muuli.</p>
<p>But that day was a long time away.  And if she didn&#8217;t prove herself here, it might never come.</p>
<p>She knew she was one of the best linguists of her species.  Her work had been invaluable in establishing communication with the many races of the Consortium when they had arrived on her world.  Jun Dal-Nieri, the highly respected head of the Contact Team, had insisted she join the Eight Degrees Project &#8212; said her skills would be invaluable in decoding the Message that was the riddle of the age.  </p>
<p>But when she had arrived at the station, she found herself a lowly Second-Level Linguist in the Language Three Section, working for a rigid, procedure-bound, manipulative&#8230; </p>
<p>&#8220;Eek!&#8221; she squeaked, her head pulling back against her shoulders as she nearly slammed into a wall of hard white skin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, Luu!  I thought you saw me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Geeni Rount was an imposing figure &#8212; over twice Luulianni&#8217;s height, roughly tetrahedral, with a flexible limb at each of the four corners and an eye in the center of each of the four sides.  His species, the Turundi, had rebuilt themselves for work in space.  At the moment he was deeply involved with an open maintenance panel.</p>
<p>&#8220;My fault.  I was kind of distracted.&#8221;  She spoke in Consortium Trade Language.  She had been studying Turundi Modal, but at the moment she didn&#8217;t feel up to the challenge of conversing in it.  It was a complicated language, with inflections for such things as sincerity and direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thinking about Language Eight again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not any more.  Nektopk has told me to focus all my attentions on my assigned task.&#8221;  She waggled her tongue over her shoulder in the direction of his office, a gesture of disrespect that always made Geeni laugh.  But this time he didn&#8217;t even smile.  &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My government has withdrawn our representative from the Consortium Grand Council.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My President says there&#8217;s no point trying to negotiate with the Ptopku any further.  If they don&#8217;t back down, he&#8217;ll send our fleet to englobe the Ptopku homeworld.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s against the law!&#8221;</p>
<p>Geeni rocked in sad acknowledgment.  &#8220;There hasn&#8217;t been a war within the Consortium for centuries.  But the President says the Ptopku need to be stopped before they can complete construction of this &#8216;super weapon.&#8217;  The Ptopku deny everything, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This must be very hard for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know what they say &#8212; a Turundi always has multiple viewpoints.  As a member of the Project, I trust the people I work with&#8230; besides, if someone really had found plans for a weapon in the Message, I&#8217;m sure we would have heard rumors.  But as a Turundi, I know that&#8217;s just the kind of secret the Ptopku would do anything to keep.  And as a citizen of the Consortium, I just wish both governments would stop this scary nonsense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I may be just a provisional citizen, but I wish the same thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>They said their good-byes and moved off in opposite directions.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Arriving at her workspace, Luulianni climbed awkwardly into the tall chair that brought her up to the screen.  Even with threats of war in the air, she still had to do her job.  Her species was counting on her.</p>
<p>But her official assignment was deathly dull.  She tried to remind herself that comparing the character frequencies in the Message against all known languages might provide some hints at its structure, or at least directions for study, but it didn&#8217;t help.  Her mind kept drifting to the problem of Language Eight.</p>
<p>Consortium astronomers had known for centuries about the cosmic background radiation, eight standard degrees above absolute zero, that was the visible remnant of the hot compressed state of the universe over three billion standard years ago.  Slight fluctuations had been observed in this radiation for over a century, but it was just thirty-one years ago that the great Puhst astrophysicist Shimustli had recognized a definite and complex pattern &#8212; a Message that dated from the very beginning of the universe.</p>
<p>Many people felt this must be a message from the Creator; many others believed it to be technological or philosophical information from an enormously advanced and ancient species.  It could be the plans for a source of limitless energy, or an ultimate weapon, or the key to universal happiness &#8212; there was no way of knowing, but surely a Message embedded in the structure of the universe itself must be of vital importance.  So the Consortium created the enormous Eight Degrees Project, administered by the Ptopku, to study the Message and work towards a translation.</p>
<p>Great progress had been made in the first few years.  The Message consisted of just over two billion binary digits, grouped into &#8220;cells&#8221; of sixteen digits each.  It was divided into seven sections, each with a different data pattern, labeled Language One through Language Seven.  Each language section was in turn divided into three subsections.</p>
<p>And there the work had stalled for over twenty years.  The problem of decoding an alien language with no common referents had been faced and overcome again and again in the history of the Consortium, but always there were living users of the language, or related languages, or associated artifacts, or some other clues to provide context and hint at meanings.  Here there was nothing &#8212; just the single Message itself.  </p>
<p>Billions of trade credits had been poured into the problem.  Astronomers looked for similar messages from other points in the cosmos.  Archaeologists searched for artifacts on the planets of the oldest stars.  Statisticians sifted the digits of the Message for clues.  Linguists attempted to reconstruct the first languages in the galaxy from evidence in the oldest known languages.  None of these had had any success.</p>
<p>Finally, just a few months ago, a breakthrough had been made: a group of religious statisticians on Wufung Elirundi determined that there were blocks of a distinct statistical pattern embedded in the first two sections of all seven languages.  This pattern had become known as Language Eight.</p>
<p>Luulianni was fascinated by this new language, as was every other linguist, statistician, archaeologist, and crackpot in the Consortium.  She made charts of its patterns and trends.  She talked about it long into the night with the other linguists.  She even dreamed about it &#8212; rows and columns of symbols sliding back and forth, now blocking her view, now revealing glimpses of meaning that, frustratingly, slipped away when she awoke.</p>
<p>And now she had been barred from this work, condemned to slog through thousands of statistical comparisons of Language Three with known languages.  Even more frustrating, this work had all been done before &#8212; but it had to be repeated with the blocks of Language Eight removed.  It was like measuring the holes in a shuuliuntu cheese, ignoring the cheese itself that she would love to nibble.</p>
<p>Luulianni tapped and scratched the screen with her tentacle-tips, running one comparison after another.  She knew that others, such as Geeni, could write complex instructions so that the screen itself could perform repetitive tasks like this, but she didn&#8217;t know how &#8212; and, besides, Geeni had told her that the data was too inconsistent for the comparisons to be completely automated.  So the afternoon passed in repetitive drudgery.</p>
<p>Finally the time displayed in one corner of the screen caught up with her stomach &#8212; days here were longer than on her home world &#8212; and she climbed slowly down from her chair.  </p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Luulianni fixed herself a simple dinner of grubs.  The angry Ptopku and Turundi faces on her screen made her lose her appetite, so she canceled the news and called up the Message data in its place.  As she ate, she scribbled on a piece of paper.  Surely my meal time is my own, she thought.</p>
<p>With the blocks of Language Eight removed from the other seven languages, it became obvious that the numerical cell values of all the others clustered in the low end of the range of possible values, while the values of Language Eight were scattered all over the range.  It wasn&#8217;t video or audio data, but to Luulianni it didn&#8217;t smell like a natural language either.  What else could it be?</p>
<p>One of the frustrations of working with the screen was that all work had to be done in the alphabet of the Consortium Trade Language, each cell value being represented by an arbitrary and unpronounceable triplet of letters.  But on her own, on paper, Luulianni used notations of her own invention.  She had developed a different writing system for each language, constantly revising each to reflect her growing understanding of its shape and smell.  Language Five, for example, used over a thousand different cell values &#8212; it seemed to be a pictographic language, so she had developed an enormous library of pictograms for it.  She knew the little symbols she drew had no relation to the actual meanings of the cells, but staring at them was more natural, more intuitive, than staring at letter triplets.</p>
<p>For Language Eight, which used tens of thousands of cell values, she was currently using a notation based on the sixteen binary digits of each cell.  She drew a grid of lines on her paper, mentally divided each square into four by four, and placed a dot or a line in each location corresponding to the zero or one value of the corresponding digit.  It was tedious work, but by doing it with a pen held in her own two tentacle-tips she felt connected to the language in a way the screen could never allow.</p>
<p>Her cup of grubs sat half-eaten on the table beside her as she reached the bottom of the sheet and started on another one.  One of the grubs made it to the edge of the cup and fell with a small, soft sound to the tabletop; absently she slurped it up with a flick of her tongue and kept writing.  As long as I haven&#8217;t finished my dinner, she thought, I can keep working on this.</p>
<p>A long time later, well after she should have gone to sleep, three grubs lay forgotten in the cup.  But when she reached for another sheet, there wasn&#8217;t one.  She had exhausted her pile of used printouts.</p>
<p>Frustrated, she flipped her current sheet over, but the other side was already densely covered with print.  She looked on the backs of some previous sheets &#8212; the same.  Finally she came across one that had an unmarked strip running down one side.  She drew a grid of tall narrow rectangles, instead of squares, in the empty space, so there would be the same number of cells in each line as before.  But when she found her four-by-four arrangement of dots and lines was illegible in that space, she switched to a simple linear arrangement, writing the dots and lines vertically for each cell.</p>
<p>She was halfway down the page when she saw something peculiar out of the corner of her eye.  She blinked and sat up from where she had been crouched, nose to the page.</p>
<p>It looked like a circle.  A loose, ragged circle of lines in a field of dots.  She squinted a little and it became clearer.</p>
<p>There was another circle.  But this one had a line across its center.  And over there, a triangle.</p>
<p>She sat stunned.  A grub crawled across the page; her tongue snatched it up without tasting it.</p>
<p>Pictures.  Crude, simplistic, but recognizable.  </p>
<p>Language Eight was pictures!</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Early the next morning a haggard, rheumy-eyed Luulianni stood at the foot of Nektopk&#8217;s desk.  Scattered on the floor around her was an assortment of old printouts, flattened boxes, paper wipes, and even her Letter of Commendation, pulled from its frame on the wall &#8212; all covered with dots and lines in a variety of colors.  </p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you see?&#8221; she wailed.  &#8220;This could be the key to all seven languages!&#8221;  She swayed a bit on her feet, and she realized she had accidentally addressed Nektopk as an equal.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re simply misleading yourself,&#8221; he replied, stressing the pronoun that indicated her status.  &#8220;These little pictures are the product of selective reasoning, wishful thinking, and lack of sleep.  A few apparent patterns here and there are only to be expected in any data set of this size.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But look at this circle!  And here&#8217;s another one, with a dot in the center!  And here, and here, and look, here&#8217;s a very clear cross!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but what about the tens of thousands of cells that do not display such clear pictures?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They may be in a more complex notation.  The simple pictures could point the way to decoding the rest of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nektopk lowered himself gently to the floor next to Luulianni and took her lower set of tentacles in his feet.  They were warm and rough.  &#8220;Dear child, surely something so obvious would have been discovered by other researchers before this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe they did, then dismissed it like you just did.  Maybe they missed it because it was too obvious.  But it needs to be studied, not just discarded!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re tired.  Go back to your quarters and get some rest, then wash yourself and come back in the afternoon.  It&#8217;s obvious you&#8217;ve been working too hard &#8212; I&#8217;ve misjudged your abilities.  I&#8217;ll see if I can come up with a simpler assignment for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes narrowed.  &#8220;Go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miserably, she began to gather her papers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave those here.  I don&#8217;t want you wasting any more time on them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luulianni felt her scales rising with rage.  She struggled to keep her voice level.  &#8220;These are my papers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything on this station is the property of the Project.  If you insist on compounding your theft of services with theft of property, you will make it very<br />
difficult for me to continue to shield you from the consequences of your actions.  Now go!&#8221;</p>
<p>They stared at each other for a moment, her two eyes trying and failing to meet his six.  Finally she pulled herself to her full height and said &#8220;Very well.  But this Letter of Commendation is my property.  It was given to me by Jun Dal-Nieri herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it and leave.  But you must be prepared to account for your behavior.  I want to see you here at twenty-nine this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Exhausted though she was, Luulianni was too angry to sleep, too angry to eat, too angry even to stop moving.  She paced back and forth in Geeni&#8217;s workspace, knotting and unknotting her tentacles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish we&#8217;d never invented radio!&#8221; she fumed.  &#8220;I thought it was so wonderful the first time I heard voices from the air.  If I&#8217;d known we were broadcasting our existence to the universe I would have personally smashed every transmitter!  Maybe I could have stopped it before anyone noticed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t work that way.  By the time that first broadcast was over, the beginning of it was already halfway across Consortium space.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And three years later we were thrust into a universe of rocket ships, idiot screens, and six-eyed bureaucrats who wouldn&#8217;t recognize an idea if it fell on them!  We never had a chance to get to our own feet before the Consortium came and scooped us up like bad little children!  And now they&#8217;re going to blow themselves up, and us with them!&#8221;  She stopped pacing as she realized what she&#8217;d said.  &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so sorry, Geeni&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be.  I&#8217;m worried too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luulianni stared at the Letter of Commendation still crushed in her lower tentacles.  She began to tremble with sorrow and exhaustion.  &#8220;I was the lead translator for Contact.  I helped make it all happen.  I was so proud when I was invited to join the Eight Degrees Project!  And now look at me.&#8221;  She curled into a defensive ball, her words barely audible.  &#8220;I&#8217;m a Second-Level Linguist, my supervisor hates me, and I&#8217;m probably going to lose my job.  And keep my people from joining the Consortium.  If there is still a Consortium to join.&#8221;</p>
<p>Geeni reached out a hand and stroked her trembling scales.  &#8220;It&#8217;ll be all right,&#8221; he said.  But he said it in Turundi Modal, and the inflection of the verb indicated he didn&#8217;t really believe it.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Twenty-nine in the afternoon, and Luulianni stood with bowed head at the foot of Nektopk&#8217;s desk.  Hanging to the left and right of Nektopk were two other Ptopku, even older and darker and surlier than he.  &#8220;I have asked Kutotop and Epotkup here to observe these proceedings and verify their fairness.&#8221;<br />
Luulianni&#8217;s tentacles contracted with dread at the words.  &#8220;You were specifically instructed on more than one occasion to stop expending Project resources on work unrelated to your specific assignment.  Do you confirm that this is true?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she muttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please speak up,&#8221; said the one on the left &#8212; Kutotop &#8212; addressing her as an equal.</p>
<p>Luulianni swallowed, then repeated more firmly: &#8220;Yes, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You also,&#8221; Nektopk interrupted, &#8220;came to my office in a state of disarray, and presented to me a series of improperly formatted and unauthorized works on the topic of Language Eight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Improperly formatted&#8217;?&#8221; Her toes curled in indignation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you confirm that this is true?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did present to you my work on Language Eight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you deny that Language Eight is entirely outside your specific assignment?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a trained linguist!  I was asked to join the Project because of my unique skills!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is irrelevant to the current discussion.  Does your assignment include Language Eight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well.  Therefore, since you admit you have repeatedly disobeyed specific job-related instructions, I have no choice but to discipline you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are hereby demoted to Third-Level Linguist, effective immediately.  Your personal screen access to Project information will be revoked, and your workspace access will be limited to data immediately relevant to your work on Language Three.&#8221;  Luulianni opened her mouth to protest, but Nektopk held up a toe to silence her.  &#8220;Furthermore, you are placed on probationary status, and any further disobedience may result in dismissal from the Project.  Do you understand the effect this would have upon your species&#8217; evaluation for membership in the Consortium?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;  She managed to squeeze the word out between teeth held firmly together.  It was the only way to keep them from chattering visibly in anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finally, you are specifically instructed not to do any further work of any kind on Language Eight, nor are you to discuss your previous unauthorized work with anyone.  Do you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may return to your quarters.  You will receive a new and less taxing assignment tomorrow morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luulianni turned and walked out without saying a word.  She didn&#8217;t trust herself to say anything that wouldn&#8217;t get her in even more trouble.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>She filed a protest, but the grievance committee was headed by Nektopk&#8217;s friend Epotkup.  She contacted her homeworld, but the government of a provisional species had no clout within the Project.  She sent a message to Jun Dal-Nieri, but received a noncommittal reply encouraging her to keep her spirits up.  Finally she resigned herself to her situation and tried to make the best of it.</p>
<p>She did as she was told for eight days.  Eight days of boring, repetitive, interminable work that she wouldn&#8217;t even have asked her students to do when she was teaching.  But on the eighth day she got a private message from Geeni: &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell anyone else, but I saw something while I was doing maintenance on the main data store.  The Senior Redactor for Language Four has made some kind of breakthrough on Language Eight!  They&#8217;re going to call a big conference to discuss the breakthrough and its implications.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luulianni sat rigidly at her screen as she read the message, trembling, scales rising all along her back.  </p>
<p>The Senior Redactor for Language Four was Doun Epotkup, who had been present at Luulianni&#8217;s demotion.</p>
<p>The sound of her chair clattering to the floor was cut off by the door closing behind her.</p>
<p> #</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to take your suspicions to your supervisor,&#8221; Geeni said.</p>
<p>&#8220;My supervisor is the one who stole my idea in the first place!  He&#8217;s just using Epotkup as a shield.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you so sure he stole your idea?  We don&#8217;t know what the breakthrough is.  It could be completely unrelated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Epotkup has never done any work on Language Eight before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk to the head of the Section, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the Section heads are Ptopku.  Who are they going to believe?  Two Senior Redactors, or a recently demoted Third-Level Linguist from a provisional species?  And I&#8217;ve already exhausted all my protest options.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There must be someone who will listen&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then Geeni&#8217;s screen sounded an incoming video call.  Luulianni ducked out of the camera&#8217;s view.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Station Security,&#8221; said the Ptopku voice from the screen.  &#8220;Ordinator Rount, do you know a Third-Level Linguist by the name of Luulianni?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Linguist Luulianni is wanted by Security on a matter of gravest importance.  Do you know her current location?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;  Luulianni was glad that Consortium Trade Language did not indicate a statement&#8217;s degree of sincerity.  If they had been speaking Turundi Modal, Geeni would surely have given himself away through the habitual honesty of his grammar.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you see her, or if she contacts you, please call Security immediately.  Do not attempt to talk to her or restrain her yourself.  She is extremely dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Officer.&#8221;  Geeni terminated the call.</p>
<p>Luulianni&#8217;s scales prickled with rage.  &#8220;It&#8217;s a lie,&#8221; she said in Turundi Modal, with the highest sincerity.</p>
<p>Geeni stared at her for a time, the one eye facing her unblinking as always.  &#8220;I believe you.  But what can you do now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can prove myself.  But I need your help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of help?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know your way around this station better than anyone I know.  There must be a place I can burrow in for a few days.  I need screen access, a little food, and plenty of paper.  That&#8217;s all I ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>Geeni&#8217;s eyes never closed, and with eyes on every side he could not look away, but Luulianni had learned to tell when he was concentrating his attention in a different direction.  She waited in anxious silence while he drew away within himself.  Then, at last, he returned his gaze to her.  </p>
<p>&#8220;I can help you.  But you aren&#8217;t going to like it.&#8221;</p>
<p> #</p>
<p>The stars were very small and very bright and very far below.  Luulianni shivered violently from cold and fear, tentacle-tips clutching the tough transparent plastic of the bag that enclosed her.  Her own breath was the loudest thing in the universe.</p>
<p>Geeni swung himself from handhold to handhold on the station&#8217;s outer surface, the two of them turning over and over together as he went.  She tried not to remember that only the firm grip of his hands kept the two of them from falling away from the rotating station, dropping just as fast as they would in real gravity &#8212; but with no bottom.</p>
<p>She reminded herself again that this was part of Geeni&#8217;s job and that he was good at it.  He said he even liked it.</p>
<p>She couldn&#8217;t imagine liking it.</p>
<p>The only thing more terrifying than too much sky above was too much sky below.  </p>
<p>Finally Geeni stopped, pulled open a hatch, and thrust her inside.  As he&#8217;d instructed her, she waited for the light on the hatch to turn blue before unzipping the bag.  She felt a pain in her ears, but she swallowed several times and it went away.  The air in the tiny space was even colder than the air in the bag, if that were possible, and stank of oil and metal.  </p>
<p>She looked through the tiny window in the hatch beneath her feet.  Geeni waved a hand, and his voice came from the short-range radio in her pack.  &#8220;How are you doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;C-c-cold!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll warm up soon.  Check the systems like I told you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The compartment was a maintenance access point that could also be used as an emergency refuge in case of space suit failure.  There was plenty of air and water, and a box of multi-species survival food.  And most important, when she attached Geeni&#8217;s small portable screen to the data port, she had full access.<br />
&#8220;Everything checks out.  And it is getting a little warmer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember, keep the window covered and use the screen for reading only.  If you write anything they&#8217;ll know you&#8217;re here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got it.  And Geeni?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;  She said it in the most sincere Turundi Modal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good luck,&#8221; he replied in the same language and mode.</p>
<p>The floor creaked alarmingly as Geeni swung away.  Once he was gone there was a pinging and tapping as various metal and plastic parts warmed up, occasional rushing sounds from some of the pipes that ran through the compartment, and the continuous wheeze of the airmaker.  The air grew warmer, but not very, and it still stung Luulianni&#8217;s nose with the reek of rubber and electricity.</p>
<p>But the space was blessedly, refreshingly, small.  And she had brought as much paper as she could fit in her pack.</p>
<p>She set to work.</p>
<p> #</p>
<p>Luulianni threw her pen at her paper in disgust.  It bounced off, leaving a small mark, and rattled out of reach behind a pipe in the corner.  She sighed, then growled and crushed the paper into a wad with all four tentacles.</p>
<p>Maybe Nektopk had been right in the first place.  The vast majority of the blocks of Language Eight refused to resolve themselves into any understandable pattern.  And the more she stared at the shapes she had found, the more she started to wonder whether she had been fooling herself all along.  This circle, for instance, was a patchy, ragged thing, full of gaps.  She knew some species saw pictures they called &#8220;constellations&#8221; in the night sky, imposing meaning on the random patterns of the stars.  Had she done the same with the digits of Language Eight?  </p>
<p>Experimentally, she tried writing out only every other cell, skipping the cells with the apparent gaps.  If there were a real pattern, surely removing half the data would destroy it.  Alternatively, removing the gaps would make clear that the circle she&#8217;d thought she&#8217;d seen was only a mirage.<br />
It didn&#8217;t do either of those things.  With the gaps removed, the circle was much crisper and clearer, although now it was an oval.  And furthermore&#8230; she kept transcribing.  Leaving out every other cell, the remaining data in the block formed a series of lines.</p>
<p>Now she was curious about the data she&#8217;d left out.  She went back and transcribed only the missing cells, and was amazed to find they also formed a clear set of lines.  And not only that, but&#8230; she tore the paper in half and placed the second picture above the first.</p>
<p>The two sets of lines connected up very tidily.</p>
<p>She sat and stared at the resulting single picture.  The oval was accompanied by lines that might be interpreted as indicating motion in a left-hand curve.  It was simplistic, but quite clear.  There was no possibility of wishful thinking &#8212; this picture was definitely and unambiguously present in the data.<br />
It was probably the most meaningful thing anyone had ever found in the Message.  Even though she had no idea what it meant.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Some time later she had covered almost every surface of the compartment with paper.  There were ovals and circles and squares, lines and curves and dots.  It was a spare, concise graphical system.  She was strongly tempted to interpret the pictures literally, but she knew that a picture of a square falling might indicate the sound of the word for &#8220;falling&#8221; rather than the concept &#8220;falling.&#8221;  Or perhaps just the first phoneme of that word.  And there were many pictures whose meaning was not at first apparent.</p>
<p>Just then the floor creaked, and her heart nearly stopped.  But it was only Geeni.  </p>
<p>&#8220;The Turundi Third Fleet is on its way to the Ptopku homeworld,&#8221; he said.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Geeni, that&#8217;s terrible!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s worse news.  They&#8217;re also planning to englobe other major Ptopku planets and facilities&#8230; including this station.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;re unarmed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Ptopku are sending ships of their own to defend us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what we need&#8230; we&#8217;ll be right in the middle of a war zone!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s still some hope for a peaceful settlement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are they going to do with you, and the other Turundi on the station?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re leaving us alone as a show of Consortium solidarity&#8230; and because there are too many of us in important technical positions.  They&#8217;re also proceeding with the conference on Language Eight, to demonstrate their sincerity about the Message not being decoded yet.  Which reminds me&#8230; Epotkup has released his findings.  He says Language Eight is a syllabic language encoded with eight-digit cells.  That&#8217;s different from what you found, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That means he didn&#8217;t steal your idea at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s plausible.  But the pictures are really there.  Look!&#8221;  She pressed some papers against the window so Geeni could see them, and explained what she had found.  </p>
<p>Geeni was amazed, especially when he realized she had done all this work with pen and paper.  He said he would write a code to translate all the blocks of Language Eight into pictures she could see on the screen.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave the pictures in my personal data storage area.  You&#8217;ll be able to see them, because you&#8217;re using my access permissions, but nobody else will.&#8221;</p>
<p>She thanked him profusely, but she barely even noticed the sounds the floor made as he swung away.</p>
<p>Epotkup must have seen her work on Language Eight.  Why else would he suddenly announce a breakthrough in a language he&#8217;d never shown any interest in before?  But if he had seen her work, why were his findings so very far off the track?</p>
<p>It was as though he were trying to lead other researchers astray.</p>
<p>But why would a Senior Redactor do such a thing?</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Her brooding was interrupted by a message from Geeni indicating that the first batch of pictures was available for her use, and soon the problems of Epotkup and the impending war were the furthest things from her mind.</p>
<p>Having the pictures on the screen was an enormous help.  It rapidly became clear that the first subsection of each language had many more pictures, and simpler pictures, than the second subsection.  And though most of the pictures were unique within a language, many of them repeated in some or all of the other languages.</p>
<p>When she finally realized what she was seeing she laughed out loud.  Then she slapped her tentacles across her mouth, afraid she might give away her hiding place.  Then, as the implications of what she had seen began to sink in, she sat down hard and began to tremble.</p>
<p>The pictures were meant to be interpreted literally.  </p>
<p>The first section of each language was a primer: each picture was followed by a word or words with the same meaning.  Read in order, the pictures built up a graphical vocabulary that, together with the increasing sophistication of the words, led up to the second section: a formal dictionary of the language, with more pictures to help the reader along.  And, since there were so many pictures in common between the seven languages, each language could be used to bridge gaps in understanding that might occur in the others.  </p>
<p>The third section of each language was a long passage of text with no pictures.  That section had to be the end goal of all the other content: the real message in the Message.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>When Luulianni was a child she had accidentally tunneled through the wall of her playroom into her neighbor&#8217;s home.  The familiar feel of dirt under her tentacles had suddenly given way to air, a terrifying feeling of falling, an opening into an exciting new world of unexpected sights and smells.</p>
<p>This felt just like that.  </p>
<p>The air in the compartment was very dry, and her lips and her tentacles chapped and then began to crack.  She did not sleep.  She did not eat.  Sometimes she realized just how thirsty she was and drank some water.  </p>
<p>Everything took on an amazing lucidity.  Occasionally her parents would come by and ask how she was doing, but she waved them away impatiently.  It was only later that she remembered her parents were dead.</p>
<p>Geeni appeared at the window again and again, increasingly frantic.  Luulianni was being accused of horrible crimes &#8212; datajacking and drug smuggling and slavery &#8212; and Station Security had interviewed him repeatedly.  They obviously suspected he was hiding her.  </p>
<p>She waved him away too.  </p>
<p>Word by word, the Message emerged from its three-billion-year sleep like a tiny plant cracking its seed and thrusting toward the light.  She was frustrated by her clumsy, chapped tentacles.  They could not write as fast as she could read, now.  She even knew the real name of Language Three &#8212; or at least she knew the symbols in her own notation that made up its name.  At times she even felt she knew how to pronounce it.</p>
<p>At last there came a point where she sat back and just read the sentences she had successfully translated, read them over and over, let their meaning soak into her.  </p>
<p>And then she trembled with sorrow, in a way she had never done since her mother died.  All the anger she had felt toward the Consortium drained away, replaced by gratitude &#8212; the regretful gratitude of an adult child who realizes at last just how much her parents have done for her &#8212; and by sadness for the lonely race that had sent the Message.  </p>
<p>She only hoped it had not been received too late.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>An unknown time later she was jerked from her stupor by Geeni&#8217;s insistent pounding on the hatch.  He said there was an important meeting she must not miss.  She knew she needed to go, but it was hard to remember why.</p>
<p>Moving as though underwater, Luulianni gathered her papers and forced them clumsily into her pack, then climbed slowly into the bag she had come in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure you&#8217;ve sealed it properly?&#8221; Geeni shouted.  His voice in the radio was tiny and funny.  Had he said that before?</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; she said.  She looked at it again.  Was she really sure?  Maybe not.</p>
<p>She pulled the zipper shut the last few tentacle-widths just as Geeni opened the hatch.  The bag puffed out and she felt a horrible pain in her ears.  Forgotten papers rushed out the hatch like students released from class, dragging her bag along with them.  Then she was through the hatch and the stars were all around.  She tumbled, falling freely, for a long long moment until Geeni&#8217;s hand snagged one of the carrying loops on the bag and she fell with a squeak to the bottom.</p>
<p>The trip back to the airlock was much easier than the trip out, because she was unconscious.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Geeni smuggled her through service corridors to the big conference room.  All the Section heads and many important linguists from off-station were there to hear Doun Epotkup present his findings on Language Eight.  Even Jun Dal-Nieri was there, her sleek black form seated imposingly in the place of honor on the left side of the podium.  Luulianni was nearly certain it was really Jun and not just another mirage brought on by lack of sleep.</p>
<p>At first, nobody noticed the small disheveled figure making its way slowly up the center aisle toward the podium.  But then Epotkup stopped speaking, his words trailing off in the middle of a sentence, and every eye in the room turned to her.</p>
<p>Nektopk shouted &#8220;Call Security!  This person is a dangerous criminal!&#8221;  But before anyone else could move, Jun Dal-Nieri sprang to the microphone.  Her people were predators, and her powerful limbs commanded as much respect as her position and reputation.  </p>
<p>&#8220;I have never known anyone more talented or trustworthy than Linguist Luulianni,&#8221; Jun said as Epotkup sidled hastily away.  &#8220;We should at least listen to whatever she has come here to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nektopk&#8217;s fur bristled in fear, but he stood his ground.  &#8220;You don&#8217;t know the harm she could do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then Kutotop, the third Ptopku from Luulianni&#8217;s demotion, rose from his seat.  &#8220;Let her speak,&#8221; he said.  Nektopk sputtered an enraged sentence at him in some Ptopku dialect, but Kutotop replied in Consortium Trade Language.  &#8220;I have grown very uncomfortable with our handling of this situation, Nektopk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This could mean the end of the Project!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It could mean the conclusion of the Project.  But perhaps the time has come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nektopk shouted again in Ptopku dialect.</p>
<p>Kutotop waved a hand in negation.  &#8220;It is not worth the risk of war.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nektopk&#8217;s eyes darted from Kutotop to Jun to Luulianni, his gaze hard and cold as the stars outside her little window.  &#8220;I refuse to be party to this disaster,&#8221; he said, and in three great swings of his arms was out the door.</p>
<p>Luulianni shuffled to the podium and climbed awkwardly up to the lectern, with Kutotop and Jun&#8217;s help.  As Kutotop placed his microphone around her neck, he said &#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry we treated you this way, Linguist Luulianni.  Nektopk&#8217;s faction believed we could win a war with the Turundi.  They blocked progress on the Message and spread false intelligence about a super weapon to provoke an attack, hoping to get the rest of the Consortium on our side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jun&#8217;s ears were flattened in shame.  &#8220;I owe you an apology too.  We suspected they were deliberately prolonging the Project, but we didn&#8217;t know why.  I feared if I shared my suspicions with you on a Ptopku-controlled channel it could jeopardize you.  I didn&#8217;t realize how much trouble you could get into on your own!&#8221;</p>
<p>Later, Luulianni did not remember her speech, but those who had heard it told her it was quite coherent and very moving.  She began by thanking Jun and the whole Consortium for the help they had given her and her species.  The audience rumbled when she explained what she had discovered about Language Eight, and made a shuffling and mumbling sound as the sample pictures that Geeni had printed out were passed around.  Luulianni explained the structure of the three sections of each language and gave a few examples.</p>
<p>Then she read the portions of the Message that she had translated.</p>
<p>Pandemonium.  The conference fragmented into a hundred individual, indelible memories&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8211; Jun sat stunned, tears leaking slowly from her eyes, overwhelmed by the poignancy of the Message itself&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8211; Epotkup covered his head with his hands, muttering in Ptopku Dominant: &#8220;Lost, all lost&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Kutotop argued excitedly with the other linguists&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8211; Geeni bounded out of the room, tumbling end over end, rushing to tell his government that the Message held no military secrets, that the war could be called off&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8211; Nektopk, in his quarters, turned a small black pill over and over between his fingers, thinking that the new Ptopku government would have to find another scapegoat&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;but Luulianni saw none of them.  She slid to the floor and passed out.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>One hundred Consortium Standard years later a monument was dedicated at the spaceport on the Muuli homeworld.  There was a statue of Luulianni, of course, showing her as she had looked in her later years as the Muuli representative to the Consortium Grand Council.  But the largest part of the monument consisted of the text of the Message, in its seven original languages and all the languages of the Consortium.</p>
<p>It read as follows:<br />
<em><br />
Greetings from the species once known as Homo Sapiens.  You who read this are, in a way, our children.  We hope that you will forgive us for what we have done to you.</p>
<p>We lived a long time, as a species, but in that time we spread over only a small portion of a single galaxy.  In all that time we met only one other intelligent species, and that was nearly dead.  We heard messages from two others, but they were so far away that conversation was impossible.</p>
<p>We learned much about our universe, and we learned how to break many of the rules of physics.  But the speed of light was one rule we never could break.  So, in the end, we died.  </p>
<p>We died of loneliness.</p>
<p>Before we died we scattered many tiny machines into the void.  These machines broke some of the rules, and made more of themselves to break them further.  Eventually they caused our universe to collapse, to return itself to its initial state.  And, in the final moments of that collapse, these machines changed the rules for the new universe that was to follow.</p>
<p>If we succeeded, your universe is smaller and hotter and faster than ours.  You have many different life forms and they can talk with and visit each other.<br />
You may hate us for the wars that easy travel and communication make possible, and for the stars that burn themselves out so quickly, and for interfering with your universe before it was even born.  But we did it because, like all parents, we wanted our children to have a better life than we did.</p>
<p>The window between universes is small, and this Message is our attempt to preserve a small part of our language and culture.  Please remember us.  Please forgive us.</p>
<p>Goodbye.</em></p>

Written on the Wind
by David D. Levine

Thuren Nektopk peered down at Luulianni from above his massive desk.  "I suspect you know why I've called you to speak with me in person."  He spoke in his native language, Ptopku Dominant, using the form of address for a subordinate or a child.  It was a constant reminder that the Ptopku had built and largely staffed this station, and was one of the most powerful species in the Consortium.

"Yes, Supervisor," Luulianni replied in the same language, knotting her tentacles.  

"And that would be...?"

"Because of my side project."

"Yes."  Nektopk suddenly released the bar from which he hung, caught himself on another handhold, and with two swift strokes of his arms swung down to where his six slitted eyes were level with Luulianni's.  "Your little side project."  

Luulianni cringed.  "I don't understand why it's so much of a problem."  She straightened and tried to meet his gaze.  "I put in my full quota of time every day."

"Yes, you do, and not one moment more.  But I know you are capable of so much more than that.  Any work you do on this pointless little side project of yours constitutes theft of resources from the Section -- from the whole Project!"

"Theft?" she squeaked.  Angry at herself for the loss of control, she brought her voice down.  "Theft of resources?  But I don't use any data storage space, or any other Section resources!  I write my notes on the backs of old printouts."  She did not mention how much more natural it felt to work on paper.

"You are stealing the most valuable resource of all!"  Nektopk pointed at her with one limber foot.  "Your own time and attention!"

"But it's my time!"

"You have been sent here by your people -- at considerable expense, I might add -- to assist in the Project, to learn the ways of the Consortium, and to demonstrate your species' unique skills."  He leaned closer to her.  His smell was bitter.  "And if I find that your species, as represented by yourself, does not demonstrate any unique skills, your application for Consortium membership could very well be denied."  He swung himself up to the edge of his desk, the better to glare down at her.  "Therefore, your time is not your own.  You owe it to the Section, to the Project, and to your own people to put every bit of available time into your assigned task."

Luulianni hung her head.  "Yes, Supervisor."

"You may return to your work."

"Thank you, Supervisor."

Luulianni's scales prickled with anger as she made her way back to her workspace.  If she was to demonstrate her unique skills, why did he not listen to her ideas?  And if her time was so valuable, why did Nektopk insist that she come to his office, halfway across the station, rather than using the screen?  

She straightened her shoulders and forced herself to walk down the middle of the corridor.  The Muuli were a burrowing species; her instinct was to cling to the wall, to hide from the harsh, bluish light and the Ptopku swinging from handhold to handhold far above.  Luulianni consoled herself that some day her people would build their own stations in space, with low ceilings and narrow corridors.  They would be dark, and warm, and smell of dirt and of many long-nosed Muuli.

But that day was a long time away.  And if she didn't prove herself here, it might never come.

She knew she was one of the best linguists of her species.  Her work had been invaluable in establishing communication with the many races of the Consortium when they had arrived on her world.  Jun Dal-Nieri, the highly respected head of the Contact Team, had insisted she join the Eight Degrees Projec</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To our lovely readers—</p>
<p>It’s awards season, and yes, we will be talking about it on the blog, and in future podcasts. Even as SF authors all over are posting on their blogs about their 2010 award-eligible work, others are discussing whether this is blatantly trolling for votes.</p>
<p>I can see how a constant barrage of VOTE FOR ME OMG could be irritating and tacky. I certainly find it so when it’s podcast award season, and one award allows listeners to vote daily, so the constant vote requests tend to be cacophonous. However, I’m spreading out the awards information for one main reason: don’t forget the podcasts.</p>
<p>Until recently, people didn’t even think about nominating a podcast (or any web content) for a Hugo. Heck, it was ground-breaking when webzines started to win. But last year, Catherine Valente self-published a book on her site, and it went on to win the Andre Norton award for best YA novel. Clarkesworld, an online magazine, won the Hugo for best semi-pro zine. And as we’ve mentioned several times (because it’s still SO FREAKING COOL) Starship Sofa won the Hugo for best fanzine.</p>
<p>I had an uncomfortable panel discussion at last year’s NASFiC (North American Science Fiction Convention). We had a panel on podcasting and a very bitter fanzine author showed up (I’d politely say they shall remain nameless, but honestly I never did catch their name), This person expressed anger that these new methods of reaching fans were getting all their friends to vote for them, as if new fans, or listeners to SF instead of readers, were less worthy to vote for the Hugos.</p>
<p>What gets me is that the new is considered unworthy, not paying its dues, and the fans are similarly unworthy, and their votes just don’t mean as much. I find that incredibly offensive, as our fans are worldwide, and many have been dedicated to us since we launched five years ago. Others are new to the genre, just trying it out, and loving it, and I sure as hell don’t want to take a new fan of the genre and tell them they aren’t worthy.</p>
<p>You, the readers and listeners, don’t give a crap about this infighting in SF. You want a good story. We try to deliver it to you. As does LightSpeed and Clarkesworld and Starship Sofa and Pseudopod and Podcastle and Drabblecast and Asimov’s and Analog and F&amp;SF and Weird Tales&#8230; and so on. You want SF content. We give it to you. And that’s the end of story. (Until next week, anyway.)</p>
<p>I had not planned on going on such an impassioned rant. I just want to say that a new fan is worth just as much as an old fan, and a new way to experience shot stories is not a reason to discount it. And whether the Internet-wary veterans like it or not, if you’re eligible to vote for these awards (WorldCon member for Hugos, SFWA member for Nebulas, and HWA member for Stokers) then your vote counts just as much as theirs does.</p>
<p>I wanted to use this letter to remind you that many, many podcasts are now eligible for the major awards. Starship Sofa broke it open last year, and now we just need to let the listeners know. When you make your Hugo or Nebula or World Fantasy or Stoker ballots, consider Escape Pod, Pseudopod, and Podcastle. Don’t forget Starship Sofa and Drabblecast. Remember also your favorite podcast novels, novellas, and short stories that were released last year. I’m not telling you who to vote for, in any of the categories, just wanting to remind you that we — the online content providers — are here are here, delivering weekly content, and if you enjoy it, consider us when you make your nominations.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>

I wanted to use this letter to remind you that many, many podcasts are now eligible for the major awards. Starship Sofa broke it open last year, and now we just need to let the listeners know. When you make your Hugo or Nebula or World Fantasy or Stoker ballots, consider Escape Pod, Pseudopod, and Podcastle. Donrsquo;t forget Starship Sofa and Drabblecast. Remember also your favorite podcast novels, novellas, and short stories that were released last year. Irsquo;m not telling you who to vote for, in any of the categories, just wanting to remind you that we mdash; the online content providers mdash; are here are here, delivering weekly content, and if you enjoy it, consider us when you make your nominations.

Yours,

mdash;Mur

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/dervishhouse.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1815" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/dervishhouse.jpg" alt="" width="163" height="253" /></a><em>The Dervish House</em> by Ian McDonald is the kind of science fiction novel that rewards the attentive reader. It begs its fans to create timelines and diagrams and carefully-plotted maps of the characters&#8217; paths through the Queen of Cities. I felt I was missing layers of meaning, and if I just took the time to do the math, to make a map, I could discover the clever synchronicities and hidden stories that I missed on my first read. It may just be an illusion created by the quantity of detail crammed into this book, but I wouldn&#8217;t bet on it.</p>
<p><em>The Dervish</em> House covers a week in the lives of a group of people in Istanbul as they move through a morass of religion, technology, terrorism, commodities trading, and deals made over ancient artifacts. The drama begins when a suicide bomber strikes on the tram line. Nobody except the bomber dies &#8212; that wasn&#8217;t the point of the attack. The effects of the explosion ripple outward. One character miss a job interview. Another send his Kid Detective spy robots out to see what happened. Still another makes a note of how high the stocks for a bombing had gotten on the Terror Market.</p>
<p>From there, events spin out of anyone&#8217;s control. One of the last Greeks in Istanbul must finally face the consequences of his misspent youth. A group of day traders conspire to divert crude oil from Iran&#8217;s radioactive oil fields to Baku, and thereby turn themselves into instant millionaires. A nine-year-old boy hunts for terrorists while the squatter in his basement sees visions of djinni. Across the street, a woman searches for the tomb of a mummy who was embalmed in honey &#8212; the legendary Mellified Man, whose flesh is said to have healing powers to rival a unicorn&#8217;s horn, and who may have never existed in the first place.</p>
<p>From a science fiction point of view, one of the more interesting aspects of <em>The Dervish House</em> is the way McDonald makes nanotech scary without resorting to a gray goo scenario. In fact, explicitly denies that scenario. He points out that we already live in a world filled with replicating micro-bots: We call them bacteria. The problem with nanotech is not that it might drown the world under a blanket of ooze, but that it could be used to reprogram the human mind on the scale of an epidemic. Simultaneously, he presents this as nanotech&#8217;s great promise &#8212; that we could turn every person&#8217;s body into a living computer of vast capacity.</p>
<p>I first heard of Ian McDonald in discussions of <em>The Windup Girl</em>. <em>The Dervish House</em> has the same sort of complex plotting and frenetic pace as <em>The Windup Girl</em>, but with far more complexity and optimism and both in the setting and in the characters. Yes, there is global warming to deal with, and nasty geopolitics, and the threat of technology used for evil, but there is also beauty and hope in McDonald&#8217;s Istanbul. In a way, <em>The Dervish House</em> calls to mind my favorite parts of my beloved cyberpunk &#8212; flying through filthy, glorious cities, watching brilliant people struggling in the space between corrupt governments and ruthless corporations.</p>
<p><em>The Dervish House</em> is supremely clever. I have a feeling that I&#8217;ve missed many of the jokes (although there are some good ones about a science fiction writer who plays a minor role in the story). A reader who is knowledgeable in Turkish politics and history would probably get much more out of this book than I did. However, <em>The Dervish House</em> contains enough detail to get its readers through the various intrigues without resorting to tedious infodumps. This is probably not a book that will change your life, but it is a lot of fun.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Though Gary Shteyngart's latest novel is called <i>Super Sad True Love Story</i>, I found it to be a frighteningly-accurate portrayal of near-future America. It's also hilarious.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Warning: the following book review contains explicit language, which is quoted directly from the novel. Reader discretion is advised.</em></p>
<p>I find most near-future-world-gone-mad stories hit-or-miss. Either they try too hard, or the characters are too flat, or the ideas are just too far out there (or not far out there enough). But occasionally I&#8217;ll find one that has the perfect mix of stuff I like.</p>
<p>With <em>Super Sad True Love Story</em> by Gary Shteyngart, I got lucky.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ea_sstls.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1797" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ea_sstls-201x300.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="300" /></a><em>Super Sad True Love Story</em> is a hilariously-scary near-future love story about a 39-year-old man named Lenny Abramov, clearly based at least in part on Shteyngart himself. The son of Jewish Russian immigrants who moved to New York before he was born, Lenny grew up with all the Russian pessimism, Jewish guilt, and immigrant pride that those folks were wont to do. Now he works for a multinational corporation&#8217;s Post Human Services division, selling life extensions to HNWIs (high net worth individuals). Our story begins with him finishing up a year in Italy, trying to make sales and failing spectacularly, living in a way considered dangerous by his coworkers (eating too many carbs, drinking too much wine), going to parties, and trying to figure out how he&#8217;s going to explain to his boss and close friend Joshie why he hasn&#8217;t hooked any clients.</p>
<p>At a party, Lenny runs into Eunice Park, spending time in Italy between her graduation from college and her entry into law school. Eunice, the daughter of Korean immigrants living in New Jersey, is very thin, very pretty, and very much a product of her environment. Lenny falls in love with her instantly, and through a strange confluence of circumstances manages to take her to bed.</p>
<p>Using first-person accounts from Lenny&#8217;s diary and Eunice&#8217;s GlobalTeens account (more on that shortly), the book then follows Lenny and Eunice as they separate and get back together, return to New York, and try to build a relationship.</p>
<p>Until America falls.</p>
<p>From a science-fictional perspective, <em>Super Sad True Love Story</em> is the standard &#8220;America loses power while Europe and China grow in strength, America falls, America is rebuilt&#8221; story I&#8217;ve read in various short-stories and novels over the years. But where the novel shines is in the author&#8217;s uncanny predictions of the near future<a href="#jr_nf">*</a>. Here are some:</p>
<p><strong>Money:</strong> The dollar is as devalued as the currency in current third-world nations, but most upper- or middle-class Americans use yuan, or &#8220;yuan-pegged dollars&#8221;, which are worth more. Right now, if I&#8217;m reading the news right, the dollar isn&#8217;t as well-respected globally as it used to be. Also, in the book, several nations are run by their largest companies &#8212; StatOil in Norway, HSBC in the UK (which is now called HSBC-London), Stability in Canada, and Petro in Russia. Mergers are rampant, too; Eunice&#8217;s bank is AlliedWasteCVSCitigroup, and LandOLakes also apparently has a financial wing.</p>
<p><strong>Technology:</strong> Phones have been replaced by an umlaut-laden version of the word apparatus, &#8220;apparat&#8221;. People rarely speak (or &#8220;verbal&#8221;) to each other, preferring to use apparati to instantly find out about others. This is already happening; people on dates, trying to build relationships, would rather sit and stare at their phones than actually speak to each other. Apparati are also getting smaller and smaller, and are able to bring in more and more information; while cell phones have actually gotten slightly larger, the other half is already happening. (The book also has a very clever dig against iPhones in it.) Oh, and the sheer amount of information Lenny can get about Eunice as he flies back from Italy is staggering and scary &#8212; credit information, friends, photos, addresses, shopping trends&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Social Networking:</strong> Today, everyone and everything is on Facebook, and Facebook can suck in all your different social networks &#8212; Twitter, Foursquare, GetGlue, etc. In <em>Super Sad True Love Story</em>, everyone &#8212; adults, kids, professionals &#8212; uses a social network called GlobalTeens. Eunice happens to write long letters to her best friend Jenny, who lives in California (where Eunice used to live), and GlobalTeens keeps telling her that people don&#8217;t read anymore, that she should send image messages or video streams instead.</p>
<p><strong>TV News:</strong> There are apparently only two 24-hour news channels, FoxLiberty-Prime and FoxLiberty-Ultra. Lenny&#8217;s parents watch these. Everyone else gets their news from media streams, which can come from anywhere, including Lenny&#8217;s friend Noah (who does a political stream) and Noah&#8217;s girlfriend Amy (who, despite being in perfect shape, runs the &#8220;Muffintop Hour&#8221;). This is sort of a riff on Current, and others who have YouTube or UStream shows.</p>
<p><strong>Devaluation of Shock:</strong> Slang has gotten more and more extreme. JK, for example, has become &#8220;JBF&#8221;, or &#8220;just butt-fucking&#8221;. Eunice talks to Jenny about porn they watched together as children (and the context indicates this is completely normal). The terms AssLuxury and AssDoctor are thrown around with impunity. One of Noah&#8217;s friends runs a liberal-slanting news stream intercut with explicit video of hardcore homosexual sex. The pervasiveness of porn and the subsequent imitation of acts seen in it is described in Jenny&#8217;s letters to Eunice about parties where it is normal for people to have pornographic-style sex in company. A top retailer of clothes for women and men is JuicyPussy. The hot new jeans trend is called Onionskin, which are completely transparent. &#8220;TotalSurrenders&#8221; are women&#8217;s undergarments that pop right off with the touch of a button. And we complain about pants on the ground&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Rating Everything:</strong> Walking through New York City, Lenny passes credit poles, which display his high rating (1520). Apparati can rank everyone in the room to see who the most desirable men and women are. Personality and fuckability are measured on a scale of 0 to 800. At Lenny&#8217;s office (a converted synagogue &#8212; actually kind of a cool image), an arrivals/departures train board shows what kind of mood everyone is in.</p>
<p><strong>American Patriotism:</strong> In the novel, America is very much in decline. Poorly-spelled signs from the American Restoration Authority claim &#8220;Together We&#8217;ll Go Far&#8221; (the Wells Fargo slogan; I knew it sounded familiar) and various other vaguely-positive messages about change. Anti-immigrant sentiment is strong, and people who don&#8217;t look like &#8220;&#8216;Murricans&#8221; (in the Fox News sense of the word) are grouped by metaphor or stereotype &#8212; Chinese people save, Latinos spend or have bad credit, and so on. As things get worse, roadblocks are set up throughout New York, plastered with signs saying that, by reading the sign, citizens deny the existence of the checkpoint while implying their consent to let the ARA do whatever it needs to do. And while the use of apparati is permitted on airplanes, the closest Lenny can get to JFK to meet Eunice&#8217;s plane is somewhere on the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=jfk+airport&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=John+F.+Kennedy+International+Airport+(JFK),+Queens,+New+York+11422&amp;ll=40.684804,-73.769073&amp;spn=0.127829,0.338173&amp;z=12">Van Wyck Expressway</a>, at an ARA checkpoint patrolled by National Guardsmen with automatic weapons.</p>
<p>The novel is full of clever wordplay, prescient references, hilarious-while-being-vaguely-uncomfortable interactions between characters, and a scenario about the end of America that will frighten the hell out of you because it&#8217;s completely plausible. It&#8217;s also vaguely reminiscent of the way Muggle Britain was unaware of the war between Voldemort and the Order during HP6 and HP7. I really enjoyed reading it, and I got through it quickly &#8212; it&#8217;s an easy read, and I&#8217;ve always found humor to go faster than tragedy. I&#8217;d call this a satire more than anything else, but I think it also fits into sci-fi in the same way as films like <em>Gattaca</em> and <em>Code 46</em><a href="#jr_c46">**</a>, and its exaggeration of what&#8217;s happening now echoes the &#8220;Would You Like To Know More&#8221; moments of Paul Verhoeven&#8217;s adaptation of <em>Starship Troopers</em>. I definitely recommend <em>Super Sad True Love Story</em>.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m not JBF.</p>
<p><a name="jr_nf">*</a> <em>I believe the book takes place in the 2030s (possibly the 2020s or 2040s). I can&#8217;t recall it ever being explicitly stated, and I wasn&#8217;t able to easily infer it.</em></p>
<p><a name="jr_c46">**</a> <em>A quick rant about &#8220;Code 46&#8243; &#8212; I really liked the film, and thought it was beautifully-shot with great sets and locations. It doesn&#8217;t have any cursing, and there&#8217;s no explicit violence, but it&#8217;s rated R. Why? Because in one scene, actress Samantha Morton is shown from the front with her bottom half completely uncovered. Meanwhile, films suffused with violence like &#8220;The Dark Knight&#8221; and &#8220;Batman Begins&#8221; are PG-13. What does it say about us as a culture that we&#8217;re more afraid of a one-second shot of the place that babies come from than our tweens and teens seeing a pencil jammed through a guy&#8217;s eye and the aforementioned guy stumbling around in pain for at least five times that long?</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Laura Burns, aka @moonrangerlaura or @scifilaura, is a NASA Contractor  and a science fiction and podcasting fan. She participates in the  science tracks at many East Coast cons. She has attended several  WorldCons and has voted for the Hugos in times past. She is the head of  the Parsec Awards Steering Committee (<a href="http://www.parsecawards.com/" target="_blank">www.parsecawards.com</a>) and has had her secret identity documented by Mur Lafferty and Matt Wallace (<a href="http://www.murverse.com/" target="_blank">www.murverse.com</a>)</em></p>
<p>In Hollywood it is Awards season. With the constant coverage of the  Golden Globes and Oscar nominations, it is hard not to know about what  is going on in sunny Southern California. In the Science Fiction,  Fantasy and Horror world, awards season has also started, but with much  less pomp and circumstance. The two big awards for genre fiction are the  Hugos and the Nebulas. The Nebulas are determined by members of the  Science Fiction Writer&#8217;s Association, but the Hugos.. the Hugos are  determined by the fans. That means you. Or at least it could. And your  favorite podcasters hope you take the challenge.</p>
<p>First, a bit of history. The Hugo awards are managed by the World Science Fiction Society (<a href="http://www.wsfs.org/" target="_blank">http://www.wsfs.org/</a>)  and awarded at the World Science Fiction Convention (WorldCon). The  awards honor professional and fan contributions to the community. The  first WorldCon was in 1936, but the first awards weren&#8217;t given out in  1953. Isaac Asamov was the Toastmaster and Philip Jose Farmer won for  &#8220;Best New SF Author or Artist&#8221;. Even then, there was a Fan aspect to the  awards as Forrest J. Ackerman won for &#8220;#1 Fan Personality&#8221;. Over the  years the categories have evolved with the times.</p>
<p>The 2011 Categories are as follows: (<a href="http://www.renovationsf.org/hugo-intro.php" target="_blank">http://www.renovationsf.org/hugo-intro.php</a>) (<a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-categories/" target="_blank">http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-categories/</a>)<br />
* Best Novel<br />
* Best Novella<br />
* Best Novelette<br />
* Best Short Story<br />
* Best Related Work<br />
* Best Graphic Story (Trial Award)<br />
* Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form<br />
* Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form<br />
* Best Editor (Long Form)<br />
* Best Editor (Short Form)<br />
* Best Professional Artist<br />
* Best SemiProzine<br />
* Best Fanzine<br />
* Best Fan Writer<br />
* Best Fan Artist</p>
<p>Historically,  the Hugo award is a literary award, and thus the nominees are based on  printed, ink on paper works. This is changing. In 2006 podcast Novella  &#8220;Burn&#8221; (<a href="http://www.jimkelly.net/index.php?Itemid=45&amp;id=15&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory" target="_blank">http://www.jimkelly.net/index.php?Itemid=45&amp;id=15&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory</a>)  by James Patrick Kelly was nominated for the Hugo and won the Nebula in  2007.  At the 2010 ceremony, the podcast Starship Sofa (<a href="http://www.starshipsofa.com/" target="_blank">http://www.starshipsofa.com/</a>)  won the Hugo award for best Fanzine. Having been at WorldCon and NASFic  (North American Science Fiction Convention held since WorldCon was  outside North America), I can tell you that this caused a bit of a  stir.</p>
<p>From what I can determine, your favorite podcasts, stories, authors and editors are eligible for the following categories.<br />
* Best Novel<br />
* Best Novella<br />
* Best Novelette<br />
* Best Short Story<br />
* Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form<br />
* Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form<br />
* Best SemiProzine<br />
* Best Fanzine<br />
* Best Fan Writer</p>
<p>Web content is also eligible for<br />
* Best Graphic Story (Trial Award)<br />
* Best Professional Artist<br />
* Best Fan Artist</p>
<p>The  story must have been first published in 2010. You can find out more  details regarding eligibilty and the specific awards here (<a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-categories/" target="_blank">http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-categories/</a>).</p>
<p>Since the Hugo awards are determined by the fans, you have the power  to make an impact. All of the statistics on the number of nominations  and votes are posted online. (<a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/2010/09/2010-hugo-award-statistics-posted/" target="_blank">http://www.thehugoawards.org/2010/09/2010-hugo-award-statistics-posted/</a>)  Historically, fan involvement has been very low.  Last year was a  record year for Hugo Nominations with less than 900 ballots. (<a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/2010/04/a-little-data/" target="_blank">http://www.thehugoawards.org/2010/04/a-little-data/</a>) Some of the short story finalists made the cut with only 23 nomination votes.</p>
<p>So, how do you nominate and vote? First, you need to &#8220;join&#8221; the  World Science Fiction Society by purchasing a membership to the World  Science Fiction Convention. (<a href="http://www.renovationsf.org/memberships.php" target="_blank">http://www.renovationsf.org/memberships.php</a>)  There are several different membership levels. A supporting member,  someone not planning on attending the convention, costs $50 until  February 28, 2011.  A supporting member has the right to Hugo Award and  Site Selection voting rights. Receives any materials relating to that  voting. In 2010, the voting packet included free digital access to the  nominees. If you later decide to upgrade to an attending member, you  will do so at a discount. (<a href="http://www.renovationsf.org/register.php#types" target="_blank">http://www.renovationsf.org/register.php#types</a>)</p>
<p>The Hugos are arguably the most prestigious award given for genre  fiction. Far too few people get involved in the nomination and selection  process. This is your chance. Nominations are open until March 26,  2011, but you need to have purchased your membership on or before  January 31, 2011. If you were an attending or supporting member of the  2010 WorldCon (Aussiecon 4), you are automatically eligible to nominate,  but not to vote.</p>
<p>There are a lot of nuances to the Hugo awards, and I have not  covered all of the details here, but if you are interested, please  follow the links and get involved. There are some frequently asked  questions here (<a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-faq/" target="_blank">http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-faq/</a>).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anyone who&#8217;s ever been a fan of a losing sports team knows that sometimes you have to make excuses for your club&#8217;s poor play. As a lifelong Dolphins fan, believe me, I know &#8212; I&#8217;ve spent more than a decade extolling our defense while facepalming at the antics of our atrocious offense.</p>
<p>As a sci-fi fan, I&#8217;ve lately found myself feeling the same way.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ea_nof.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1782" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ea_nof-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>No one was more excited than me when <em>No Ordinary Family</em> was announced. I&#8217;ve often thought <em>The Incredibles</em> was robbed of a best picture nomination, but if the compensation is a live-action version, well&#8230; who am I to complain?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s just one problem: I don&#8217;t actually like <em>No Ordinary Family</em>.</p>
<p>On paper, the show is a great concept for someone like me: normal family gets superpowers, does superheroic things. And the cast is pretty good: Michael Chiklis as Mr Incredible, Julie Benz as the super-speedy mom, Stephen Collins playing against type as an evil research magnate, and Romany Malco (who always stole the show in <em>Weeds</em>) as the sidekick. The scripts are your tried and true origin story plots &#8212; family vs superheroism, vigilantism vs the need to do right, and the ever-popular &#8220;getting discovered&#8221; story arc. On paper, it&#8217;s a recipe for success.</p>
<p>Except that the execution keeps falling flat. The family drama is too dramatic or too silly. Most of the subplots with the kids make me want to facepalm (despite the excellent job Kay Panabaker does as the telepathic teen daughter). The geek references from Katie, one of the sidekicks, are wasted on the audience because it&#8217;s abundantly clear she&#8217;s a geek only to pacify the geek crowd who &#8212; and let&#8217;s be honest here &#8212; isn&#8217;t getting what they need from this show.</p>
<p>We wanted a live-action <em>Incredibles</em>. What we got was a family drama with a veneer of superheroic fantasy. And as bad as it would be for genre as a whole to lose <em>No Ordinary Family</em>, I can&#8217;t see any way that the show can turn itself around without killing off a few of the characters in a David Mack style (remember <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wildfire-Star-Trek-S-C-Book/dp/0743496612/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1295374728&amp;sr=8-2">what he did</a> to the crew of the <em>Da Vinci</em>, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Star-Trek-Destiny-Lost-Souls/dp/1416551751/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1295374666&amp;sr=8-7">billions he sacrificed</a> to the Borg).</p>
<p>The thing is, instead of geeks saying we should cut our losses and support other genre shows like <em>Fringe</em>, we try to have our <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Jumja_stick">jumja sticks</a> and eat them too. We make apologies for the less-intelligent plots, the overused origin stories, the constant hammering into our heads that <strong>MISUSING POWERS FOR PERSONAL GAIN IS WRONG</strong>. The core audience already knows all this stuff. They want more <em>Chuck</em> and less <em>Brothers &amp; Sisters</em>.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m not completely dim &#8212; I&#8217;ve worked in television for six years, and I understand the concept of making a show appeal to the widest audience possible. Unfortunately, homeopathy doesn&#8217;t work. Putting 1/100th of 1% of genre into a 100% solution of ABC family drama won&#8217;t cure the lack of geek audience.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m tired of making excuses for shows like <em>No Ordinary Family</em>. I&#8217;m tired of keeping passable excuses for genre on the air at the expense of truly good shows like <em>Fringe</em>. I don&#8217;t wish anyone working on the show any ill will, and if it stays on the air for five years, I&#8217;m totally fine with that. But I can&#8217;t keep ignoring the flaws of genre shows like <em>No Ordinary Family</em>. I say it cheapens the content pool as a whole, and &#8212; let&#8217;s be honest here &#8212; if they wanted a TV version of <em>The Incredibles</em>&#8230; well, doesn&#8217;t Disney own it already?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m leaving <em>No Ordinary Family</em> on the DVR, and I&#8217;ll probably finish out the season. But I can&#8217;t lie to myself anymore.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I actually like the show.</p>

<p><strong>Rejiggering the Thingamajig</strong><br />
by Eric James Stone</p>
<p>The teleport terminal had not been built with tyrannosaurus sapiens in mind.</p>
<p>Resisting the urge to knock human-sized chairs about with her tail, Bokeerk squatted on the tile floor, folded the claws of her forelimbs together, and concentrated on her breathing.  Meditation would calm her nerves.  What should have been a two-minute waystop as she switched to a different teleport line had stretched to three hours, and being the only passenger in the terminal creeped her out.</p>
<p>The cheerful voice of the customer service AI roused Bokeerk from her trance.  &#8220;It is my pleasure to inform you that the cause of the technical difficulties in the galactic teleport network has been found.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bokeerk perked up and rose on her hind legs, remembering just in time to duck her head so it wouldn&#8217;t bang the ceiling lamps.  &#8220;Please send me to Krawlak,&#8221; she said.  It was unlikely that any of her eggs would hatch for another few days yet, but she was anxious to get home.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is with the utmost regret that I must tell you that will not be possible at this time,&#8221; said the AI, with a tone of such abysmal sorrow that Bokeerk&#8217;s eyes could not help but moisten with sympathetic tears.  &#8220;I require assistance in repairing the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bokeerk lowered herself into a squat again.  &#8220;When will help get here?&#8221;  She looked at the time display on the digital assistant strapped to her left forelimb.  She had now been stranded for three hours and fifty-two minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I estimate a spaceship carrying a repair crew could be here within twelve years,&#8221; said the AI.  Its voice seemed to have lost the customer service aspect.<br />

<span id="more-1809"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Twelve years?&#8221;  Bokeerk&#8217;s voice made the ceiling lamps tremble.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without the teleport network, repair crews are limited to slower-than-light travel.  However, I believe we can avoid such a long wait if you will assist me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about repairing teleports,&#8221; said Bokeerk.  &#8220;Iillustrate children&#8217;s books.  I&#8217;m on my way home from the Galactic Children&#8217;s Book Fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not need to repair anything,&#8221; said the AI.  &#8220;You merely need to obtain the . . . there&#8217;s no word for it in English because it is a concept so far beyond the understanding of biological intelligences that there has never been a need for one until now.  Let&#8217;s call it the thingamajig.  Once you have the thingamajig, you need to do something to it that is completely incomprehensible to your puny mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey,&#8221; said Bokeerk.  She had encountered this kind of prejudice too often.  &#8220;My brain may be as small as that of an original tyrannosaurus, but it&#8217;s the product of genetic tinkering such that my intelligence is at least human standard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No slur was intended.  By my standards, any biological intelligence is puny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I just need to do something incomprehensible to the thingamajig, and the teleport network will be fixed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Show me where it is,&#8221; Bokeerk said.</p>
<p>A holographic projection of a world appeared.  It zoomed in toward a green area on one of the continents until it showed a gray dome in the middle of a jungle.  &#8220;This is the teleport station where you are currently located,&#8221; said the AI.</p>
<p>The image zoomed out until the dome was merely a gray dot.  A crimson line traced a route toward a lone mountain, where it stopped with a large dot.  &#8220;You must travel to the top of this extinct volcano, where you will find the thingamajig.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How far is that?&#8221; asked Bokeerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forty-four miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have a vehicle that would fit me, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no vehicles of any size.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bokeerk rose.  &#8220;I guess I&#8217;d better get started.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll need a gun,&#8221; said the AI.</p>
<p>She shook her head.  &#8220;I&#8217;m a Buddhist pacifist.  I refuse to intentionally harm any other creature.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a carnivore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only eat manufactured meat.  Speaking of which, I&#8217;m rather hungry now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no food available at this station.  Unfortunately, the lifeforms you encounter outside will not serve as a significant source of nutrition for you.  But you will still need a gun to defend yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By nature, I&#8217;m an apex predator,&#8221; said Bokeerk.  She bared her teeth. &#8220;I carry my own weapons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On this planet, you are prey for predators larger and faster than you.  That&#8217;s why the human colony on this planet was abandoned one hundred and thirty-two years ago, leaving only this station as a teleport network connector.  You will need a gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea of a predator that could harm her was unfamiliar to Bokeerk. But what choice did she have?  She would starve to death here, so she must fix the teleport.  That did not mean she must compromise her principles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll use the gun to scare off predators, but I will not use it to harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is your choice,&#8221; said the AI.  &#8220;You can get the gun from the weapons locker next to the terminal exit doors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yellow arrows lit up on the floor tiles, pointing toward a pair of massive reinforced metal doors.  Bokeerk followed the arrows to a cabinet which unlocked and swung open at her approach.</p>
<p>A rifle, metallic black, gleamed in the cabinet.</p>
<p>&#8220;This gun was made for humans,&#8221; Bokeerk said.  &#8220;I could never even get a claw in to pull the trigger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not a problem.  Pick it up,&#8221; said the AI.</p>
<p>Bokeerk obeyed.  The gunmetal flowed, reshaping itself.  Its handle slipped over her right claw, attaching itself firmly so she could aim the barrel by moving her forelimb.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy, pardner,&#8221; said a voice from the gun.  &#8220;My ammo chamber&#8217;s brimmin&#8217; with bullets, so I say we go kill ourselves some varmints.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bokeerk gaped in horror at the gun.  &#8220;It talks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It talks, she says,&#8221; the gun said.  &#8220;It&#8217;d be a pretty dumb gun what don&#8217;t know how to talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A short-lived fad back in the days of the human colony on this world,&#8221; said the AI.  &#8220;Unfortunately, this is the only functional gun remaining, even if it is partially insane.  It does not, in fact, have bullets &#8212; it uses hypervelocity fléchettes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not taking it,&#8221; Bokeerk said, tugging at the edge of the metal covering her claw.  &#8220;How do I get it off?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nuh-uh,&#8221; said the gun.  &#8220;I ain&#8217;t coming off.  I been stuck in that locker for waaaay too long, and I aim to do me some huntin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will need it,&#8221; said the AI.  &#8220;Fortunately for your moral principles, it will shoot on its own, so you will not be harming any creatures.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is pure sophistry,&#8221; said Bokeerk.  &#8220;If I carry it out there and it shoots something, that will be my fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be that as it may,&#8221; said the AI, &#8220;if you are to restore teleportation to the entire galaxy, you may need to compromise your principles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bokeerk was not sure she had heard correctly.  &#8220;The whole galaxy?  I thought it was just this station that wasn&#8217;t working.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The entire network is down.  Billions of people are currently trapped away from their destinations on hundreds of thousands of worlds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And this world in the back of beyond just happens to be central to the network?&#8221; she asked, incredulous.</p>
<p>&#8220;The teleportation network is dimensionless, so there can be no center.  From a technical perspective, any point in the network is as important as any other.  The thingamajig just happened to do something incomprehensible in such a way that it manifested itself here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bokeerk took the anxiousness she felt at the delay in returning to her eggs and multiplied it by billions.  Because the teleport was used for very short trips as well as interstellar ones, most people would probably be able to make their way home some other way.  But there would still be millions like her, stranded on planets light years from home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; said the gun.  &#8220;Quit your jawin&#8217; and let&#8217;s go slaughter somethin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though she hated to admit it, Bokeerk could understand the gun&#8217;s sentiments.  She had chosen a pacifist philosophy for herself not out of belief that it was the only moral way, but because it was a counter to the natural aggression embedded in her genes.  As such, her pacifism was an indulgence of the self, rather than a moral imperative.</p>
<p>But that didn&#8217;t mean she had to become a dinosaur on the rampage, either.  &#8220;Very well, on behalf of all those stranded across the galaxy, I will use force if necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the spirit!&#8221; said the gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have taken the liberty of downloading a map into your digital assistant,&#8221; said the AI.  &#8220;I cannot accompany you, of course, but I will send the janitor along with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The janitor?&#8221;</p>
<p>A shimmer grew in the air next to Bokeerk.  A nanoswarm, she realized.  The swarm thickened, forming a sphere about the size of a human head.  A smiley-face mouth opened, although it did not move as a whispery voice said, &#8220;Follow you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may come in handy at some point,&#8221; said the AI.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would make for some mighty fine target practice,&#8221; said the gun.</p>
<p>The doors creaked as they slid open.  Hot jungle air, thick with humidity, streamed into the terminal.  Bokeerk breathed it deeply through her nostrils.  Because the biology of this planet was different from that on her homeworld, the scents were different.  But they were not wholly unfamiliar, either, and she thought she could detect the tang of animal dung, the acrid aroma of urine, and the moldering stench of decaying plants.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does the thingamajig look like?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; the AI said.  &#8220;But you&#8217;ll almost certainly know it when you see it.  It will be unlike anything you have ever seen before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do I do then?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring it back here,&#8221; said the AI.  &#8220;Good luck!&#8221;  Its cheery customer service tone returned for that last bit, and Bokeerk couldn&#8217;t help but feel a little more confident.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yee-haw!&#8221; shouted the gun.  &#8220;Blood &#8216;n&#8217; guts, here we come!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gun,&#8221; said Bokeerk as she stepped out between the emerald-green vines clinging to the dome and let her foot sink into the mossy jungle soil, &#8220;let me tell you about a man known as the Buddha.&#8221;</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Sunlight filtered through the jungle canopy.  Bokeerk trotted through the trees, crunching the local equivalent of shrubbery underfoot and occasionally knocking down saplings.</p>
<p>She paused to check her progress on her digital assistant &#8212; more than halfway there, and so far she had managed to keep the gun from shooting any animals, although she suspected that the hypervelocity fléchettes it had used to fell a tree might have killed some small tree-dwellers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Run,&#8221; whispered the nanoswarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked Bokeerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Run.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bokeerk smelled nothing new in the tangle of jungle scents, and could hear nothing large moving in the trees.  She turned her head, scanning for any sign of movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;No need to make like a jackrabbit,&#8221; said the gun.  &#8220;Jes&#8217; point me in the right direction and let me do the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Run,&#8221; whispered the swarm again.</p>
<p>Sharp, jagged things closed around her right ankle.  She tried to pull away, but screamed in agony as her flesh tore.  Twisting her neck, she was able to see serrated tentacles winding around her leg.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoot me!&#8221; yelled the gun.  &#8220;Point me over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>She twisted her forelimb around, and a burst of fléchettes tore into one of the tentacles.  It jerked, then went limp.  After a few more bursts, she was able to pull her leg free.</p>
<p>The gun kept firing.  &#8220;There&#8217;s some karma for ya, ya squirmy varmints.  Better luck in your next life.&#8221;</p>
<p>She swung the gun away.  It let off a final burst into the undergrowth.  &#8220;I am free,&#8221; she said, &#8220;so there is no more need for violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was only tryin&#8217;a help &#8216;em move on to their next rebirth.  Ain&#8217;t that what you was jes&#8217; explainin&#8217; to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bokeerk sighed.  &#8220;You still have much to learn about Buddhism.&#8221;</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Halfway up the volcano&#8217;s slope, Bokeerk squatted near a stream to drink and catch her breath.  Thick jungle had given way to a sparser forest, though the trees still towered over her head.  Hunger gnawed at her stomach, and she considered hunting one of the elk-sized animals she had glimpsed along the way.  She could smell one now, close by.  It might not provide any nutrition, but it would fill her stomach.</p>
<p>It might also poison her, so she reluctantly abandoned the idea.</p>
<p>Like a silvery mist, the nanoswarm swirled around her feet.</p>
<p>The gun emitted an ominous hum.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>The hum continued, steady.</p>
<p>Was the gun going into some sort of overload?  She tried to pry it off her claw, but it clung too tightly.  &#8220;Gun, answer me!&#8221;</p>
<p>The hum stopped.  &#8220;Huh?  What?  Is there somethin&#8217; ta shoot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were making a strange sound.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the gun, &#8220;when you sat down, I figured it was time to do me some meditatin&#8217;.  So jes&#8217; pardon me for tryin&#8217;a become one with the universe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>The crack of splitting wood came from Bokeerk&#8217;s left.  She&#8217;d heard that sound many times before, when her own bulk had snapped branches off trees as she passed.  But it had never been so loud.  A whole tree must have broken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Run,&#8221; whispered the nanoswarm as another crack sounded, closer.  A shadow moved in the forest.</p>
<p>This time, Bokeerk didn&#8217;t hesitate.  She leapt forward into a loping run, branches whipping at her scales.</p>
<p>Behind her, something crashed through the trees, growing ever closer, but she dared not turn her head to look.</p>
<p>Something warm and wet flailed at her neck.  She veered to the right and it was gone, but a moment later it returned, slithering around her throat and tightening.</p>
<p>Bokeerk roared as she was lifted off her feet.  Looking up, she saw a thick black cable of a tongue stretching down from the thirty-foot-wide circular maw of a creature that could easily swallow her whole.  There were no teeth in that giant head, but hundreds of black, multifaceted eyes ringed the mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Point me at it!&#8221; yelled the gun.</p>
<p>She curved her claw upward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eat hot iridium, ya lousy bushwhacker!&#8221;  The gun kept firing burst after burst, but the tongue&#8217;s grip merely tightened.</p>
<p>The creature was too massive, Bokeerk realized.  Fléchette bursts that would have killed a human were harmless as mosquito bites to it.  She struggled to bring her jaws into position to bite the tongue, but it had her too firmly around the neck.  Maybe once she was inside the mouth, she could start doing some damage with her claws.</p>
<p>Dark spots grew in her vision.  Lack of oxygen was going to make her pass out before she got the chance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eyes,&#8221; she managed to whisper out, spending what little breath she had left.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s mighty cold-blooded of ya,&#8221; said the gun, its voice distant. &#8220;I like it.  Jes&#8217; aim a little to the side and I&#8217;ll blind this sucker all the way to Nirvana.&#8221;</p>
<p>She tried to comply, but her forelimb muscles wouldn&#8217;t respond properly.  The claw with the gun fell limp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aim me up!&#8221; yelled the gun.</p>
<p>In her dim vision, a shimmery swarm swirled up alongside the tongue and spread out over the multiple eyes of the creature.  Then the swarm disappeared.</p>
<p>The creature screeched, so loud it made Bokeerk&#8217;s ears ring, and its tongue loosened.  She felt lightheaded, but she managed to suck in a breath.</p>
<p>Then the tongue let go and she fell.  Sharp pain lanced through her left ankle as she hit awkwardly, then toppled on her side.</p>
<p>The head of the creature thrashed wildly above the treetops.  It blundered away through the forest, still screeching.</p>
<p>Bokeerk breathed deeply of the precious air.  Examining her ankle, she decided it wasn&#8217;t broken, merely sprained.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, the nanoswarm glittered its way back to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome,&#8221; the swarm whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gun,&#8221; she said as she began limping up the slope, &#8220;I think you misunderstood what I meant when I said that one who has achieved Nirvana has no need of the senses.&#8221;</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Just short of the volcano&#8217;s rim, something moved.   Bokeerk tried to focus her eyes on it, but for some reason it remained indistinct.  &#8220;I think that must be the thingamajig,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; whispered the swarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gun,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry &#8217;bout me,&#8221; said the gun.  &#8220;I ain&#8217;t gonna kill it.  I can&#8217;t even take proper aim.&#8221;</p>
<p>She limped toward the thingamajig.  As she approached, she still could not focus on it.  It looked like it was moving both toward her and away from her at the same time, yet it remained stationary.  It had no outline, no edges, no shape, but Bokeerk felt a presence there.</p>
<p>There was a faint odor that Bokeerk could not identify; it seemed to shift its properties while remaining somehow the same scent, smelling like everything and nothing.</p>
<p>Bokeerk stopped a couple of paces away.  She couldn&#8217;t tell what size the thingamajig was, whether small as a pinhead or large as a house. It didn&#8217;t even seem to be tangible.</p>
<p>&#8220;How am I supposed to pick that up and carry it back to the terminal?&#8221; she asked no one in particular.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; the swarm whispered.</p>
<p>It swirled around her head, darkening her vision, then it was gone. Sudden pinpricks of pain swept over her scalp, and she bellowed her confusion and annoyance.  Why were the nanos burrowing into her?  Was this what they had done to the giant creature?  If the swarm wanted her dead, why had it saved her earlier?</p>
<p>The pain transformed into a headache.  Bokeerk lost control of her muscles and her legs spasmed.  She collapsed to the rocky ground.  As her jaw hit, she bit into her tongue and tasted hot blood.</p>
<p>Her vision blanked, then gradually cleared &#8212; and she truly saw the thingamajig in front of her.  Somehow, she understood its multidimensional nature, the way it could simultaneously be nowhere and everywhere and right here in front of her, how it could be a singularity of infinite size.</p>
<p>And she understood how her new mental power could . . . rejigger it so the teleport network would work again.</p>
<p>The nanoswarm had reconfigured her brain and added abilities beyond its natural capacity.  She still had no control over her muscles, but she reached out toward the thingamajig with a new part of her mind.</p>
<p>Before she could rejigger it, though, she felt an overwhelming despair.  After a moment, she realized the emotion was not her own, but was emanating from the thingamajig.</p>
<p>Hello? she thought at it, uncertain whether the nanoswarm had given her the power to communicate telepathically with the thingamajig.</p>
<p>A wave of panic was followed by curiosity from the thingamajig.  Then, in a level below conscious language, it communicated with Bokeerk &#8212; she didn&#8217;t hear any words, but she knew she had been greeted, recognized as someone new with possibly friendly intentions.</p>
<p>What are you? she thought back.</p>
<p>The knowledge flowed to her.  It was itself, as it had always been. Then the not-itselfs had come and they had made it more than itself, yet that very process had made it less than itself.  Its anguish at loss of itself had been unending, but the not-itselfs kept extending itself.  Eventually the not-itselfs were gone, and it was itself again.  The joy of itself turned to despair when a not-itself appeared, but then became hope because this not-itself was different.</p>
<p>&#8220;Incomprehensible, my very large tail!&#8221; said Bokeerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; said the gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;The AIs think they can do whatever they want in running civilization.  But enslaving a sentient being to create the teleport network is too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Darn tootin&#8217;,&#8221; said the gun.  &#8220;I say we go shoot &#8216;em up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bokeerk sighed.  &#8220;I thought I was getting somewhere with you. Violence is not the answer to this problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me guess,&#8221; the gun said.  &#8220;You think talkin&#8217;s gonna solve things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk, talk, talk.  Fine.  But if&#8217;n you need any bullets for punctuation, jes&#8217; say the word.&#8221;</p>
<p>I will not enslave you again, she said to the thingamajig.  But eventually someone else will come to restore the teleportation network.</p>
<p>Gratitude and trepidation mixed, followed by puzzlement.  The thingamajig had no concept of the teleportation network.</p>
<p>It is a way for beings like me to travel, she said.  Billions of us have had our lives made easier by what the AIs did to you.  That does not make what they did right, but it explains why they did it.</p>
<p>A sadness of her own filled Bokeerk, as she realized that by not restoring the network, she was cutting herself off from the rest of the galaxy, possibly forever.  She would not see her eggs hatch.  And if the AI was right about the biochemistry of life on this planet, she would soon starve to death.</p>
<p>The thingamajig reflected Bokeerk&#8217;s sadness, then added curiosity.  It wanted to take all of Bokeerk&#8217;s knowledge into itself, but would not do so without permission.</p>
<p>You may, Bokeerk said.</p>
<p>She lost track of time as her mind became a jumble of thoughts and memories.  When it was done, she found that night had fallen.</p>
<p>You have taught me more than I ever knew was possible, the thingamajig said in Bokeerk&#8217;s mind.  I could not have imagined so many living beings of such variety.  I knew only myself, then the AIs, and finally you.</p>
<p>I am sorry that your experience with the AIs was negative, Bokeerk said.  Please do not judge living beings in general based on what they did to you.</p>
<p>Their actions were not right actions, according to the Eightfold Path, the thingamajig said, for they brought harm to me.</p>
<p>You know of the Noble Eightfold Path of Buddhism? asked Bokeerk.</p>
<p>From your mind.  The thingamajig paused.  If I do not restore the network, then I will bring harm to you.  So I will do it.  After that I will continue to serve so as to not bring harm to the multitudes that live in the galaxy.  But I will need to shut down for a few hours every week to restore myself.</p>
<p>I think the AIs will agree to that, rather than wait for years before they can force you back into service, said Bokeerk.</p>
<p>With what I have learned from you, I can prevent them from ever forcing me back, it said.  But it pleases me to have a right livelihood according to the Eightfold Path.</p>
<p>Then it vanished.</p>
<p>Bokeerk lay on the ground, still unable to get up.  Perhaps the rewiring of her brain was permanent, and she would die here.  If nothing else, she had found someone who understood Buddhism more clearly than the gun&#8211;probably more clearly than she understood it herself.</p>
<p>Then the headache started.  At least the AI had the decency to program the swarm to undo what it had done once the mission was accomplished.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, she climbed groggily to her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, where we off to now, boss?&#8221; said the gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going home,&#8221; said Bokeerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good idea,&#8221; said the gun.  &#8220;I reckon there&#8217;s lots to shoot there.&#8221;</p>

Rejiggering the Thingamajig
by Eric James Stone

The teleport terminal had not been built with tyrannosaurus sapiens in mind.

Resisting the urge to knock human-sized chairs about with her tail, Bokeerk squatted on the tile floor, folded the claws of her forelimbs together, and concentrated on her breathing.  Meditation would calm her nerves.  What should have been a two-minute waystop as she switched to a different teleport line had stretched to three hours, and being the only passenger in the terminal creeped her out.

The cheerful voice of the customer service AI roused Bokeerk from her trance.  "It is my pleasure to inform you that the cause of the technical difficulties in the galactic teleport network has been found."

Bokeerk perked up and rose on her hind legs, remembering just in time to duck her head so it wouldn't bang the ceiling lamps.  "Please send me to Krawlak," she said.  It was unlikely that any of her eggs would hatch for another few days yet, but she was anxious to get home.

"It is with the utmost regret that I must tell you that will not be possible at this time," said the AI, with a tone of such abysmal sorrow that Bokeerk's eyes could not help but moisten with sympathetic tears.  "I require assistance in repairing the problem."

Bokeerk lowered herself into a squat again.  "When will help get here?"  She looked at the time display on the digital assistant strapped to her left forelimb.  She had now been stranded for three hours and fifty-two minutes.

"I estimate a spaceship carrying a repair crew could be here within twelve years," said the AI.  Its voice seemed to have lost the customer service aspect.

"Twelve years?"  Bokeerk's voice made the ceiling lamps tremble.

"Without the teleport network, repair crews are limited to slower-than-light travel.  However, I believe we can avoid such a long wait if you will assist me."

"I don't know anything about repairing teleports," said Bokeerk.  "Iillustrate children's books.  I'm on my way home from the Galactic Children's Book Fair."

"You do not need to repair anything," said the AI.  "You merely need to obtain the . . . there's no word for it in English because it is a concept so far beyond the understanding of biological intelligences that there has never been a need for one until now.  Let's call it the thingamajig.  Once you have the thingamajig, you need to do something to it that is completely incomprehensible to your puny mind."

"Hey," said Bokeerk.  She had encountered this kind of prejudice too often.  "My brain may be as small as that of an original tyrannosaurus, but it's the product of genetic tinkering such that my intelligence is at least human standard."

"No slur was intended.  By my standards, any biological intelligence is puny."

"So I just need to do something incomprehensible to the thingamajig, and the teleport network will be fixed?"

"Yes."

"Show me where it is," Bokeerk said.

A holographic projection of a world appeared.  It zoomed in toward a green area on one of the continents until it showed a gray dome in the middle of a jungle.  "This is the teleport station where you are currently located," said the AI.

The image zoomed out until the dome was merely a gray dot.  A crimson line traced a route toward a lone mountain, where it stopped with a large dot.  "You must travel to the top of this extinct volcano, where you will find the thingamajig."

"How far is that?" asked Bokeerk.

"Forty-four miles."

"You don't have a vehicle that would fit me, do you?"

"There are no vehicles of any size."

Bokeerk rose.  "I guess I'd better get started."

"You'll need a gun...</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello 2011! I hope everyone had a happy and safe holiday and are ready for a kick-ass year&#8230; wait, it&#8217;s halfway through January already? Oh boy. But hey, this year is an odd number, and a prime one at that. That’s got to be a good sign. Right? Right.</p>
<p>My last post about <a href="http://escapepod.org/2010/12/13/superhero-fiction-the-next-big-thing/" target="_blank">superhero prose fiction</a> seemed to generate a few comments, not only here but also over at io9 who were <a href="http://io9.com/5715790/superhero-fiction-the-next-big-thing" target="_blank">kind enough to reblog it</a>. I made a lot of omissions, some glaring, and I knew I would. I’ll return to the subject of superhero prose fiction later on where we can talk properly about examples of the genre. In that post I missed a lot of titles (<a href="http://murverse.com/podcasts/#pfk" target="_blank"><em>Playing for Keeps</em></a>, <a href="http://www.mattselznick.com/writing/fiction/novels/brave-men-run/" target="_blank"><em>Brave Men Run</em></a>, George RR Martin’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Cards" target="_blank"><em>Wild Cards</em></a>, <a href="http://www.1-800-go-union.com/" target="_blank"><em>Union Dues</em></a>, <a href="http://www.michaelastackpole.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=75" target="_blank"><em>In Hero Years, I’m Dead</em></a>, to name just a few), but only because I don’t think these are (or were) signs particularly of a forthcoming movement towards superhero prose fiction. As I said last time, superhero prose fiction has been around almost as long as superhero comic fiction has been, possibly starting with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Superman_(novel)" target="_blank"><em>The Adventures of Superman</em></a><em> </em>by George Lowther from 1942 (the plot of which, involving ghost ships and Nazis, sounds awesome). While it’s probably impossible (and foolish) to try and generate a comprehensive list of superhero prose fiction, we can at least take a gander at some prime examples of the genre a bit later. As it happens, my prediction might have been right up the wazoo anyway, as it looks like the YA dystopia is shaping up to be the Next Big Thing. I might be wrong but it seems to me that the vampire/werewolf trend originated in YA books too, before influencing more adult-oriented works. Although I&#8217;m not quite sure where the fashion for zombie originated &#8211; is there a YA zombie series that I don&#8217;t know about?</p>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to touch on superheros again for a moment as there is something that has been bugging me recently. NBC&#8217;s new superhero TV series <a href="http://www.nbc.com/the-cape/" target="_blank"><em>The Cape</em></a> has started, as has the Cartoon Network&#8217;s latest DC universe animated series, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Justice_(TV_series)" target="_blank"><em>Young Justice</em></a>. The fact that they both debuted at more or less the same time is just coincidence and not particularly relevant, but it does serve to illustrate a little problem I &#8211; a comics fan and superhero write &#8211;  have with the genre.</p>
<p>Live-action superheroes just don&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>Uh-uh. Hold the hate mail and move the mouse away from the comment button. Let me explain.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/key_art_the_cape1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1764" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/key_art_the_cape1.jpg" alt="" width="547" height="213" /></a></p>
<p><em>The Cape</em> is attempt &#8211; one of the first, I think &#8211; at creating an original, made-for-television costumed superhero. <em>Costumed</em> is the key here, although it&#8217;s probably unfair to single out this one particular issue with <em>The Cape</em> given that it really is the least of the show&#8217;s problems (which, off the top of my head, include the title, the premise, the cast, the characters, the plot and the writing&#8230; but other than that it&#8217;s pretty great, no?), but it does illustrate my point. Vince Faraday, aka The Cape, looks immensely silly when dressed up as the superhero. Okay, the suit is assembled from bits and bobs from the Carnival of Crime (yes, the Carnival of Crime) and based on a comic book character beloved by his son (although not a comic book written like I have ever read, although I suppose Vince was adding in the exposition and description himself when he read an issue to his son in the first episode). But&#8230; no. It&#8217;s impractical and is looks silly.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s new? This is comic book stuff, right?</p>
<p>Actually, yes it is. <em>The Cape</em> would work fine as a comic book, assuming it was written by someone who knew what a comic book was (unlike the writer of the TV series it seems). The bits we see of the actual (fictional) comic in the TV show looks okay. And superheroes in cloaks and hoods are a dime-a-dozen, and there&#8217;s plenty of scope for dramatic flowing fabrics.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1766 alignright" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Justice_League_of_America.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />It&#8217;s perhaps telling that other, more successful television superhero shows have neatly avoided the problem of silly costumes by not featuring them at all. Everyone in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_(TV_series)" target="_blank"><em>Heroes</em></a> was in civvies. The other currently screening superhero TV series, <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/no-ordinary-family" target="_blank"><em>No Ordinary Family</em></a>, likewise has avoided comic book cliche, visually at least, even if the central premise of the story is as old as the hills. <a href="http://www.e4.com/misfits/" target="_blank"><em>Misfits</em></a>, that UK subversion of televisual superheroics clad our anti-heroes in the orange jumpsuits required by their community service, and even cracked a joke about traditional superhero costumes in one memorable scene from the second series. Notably, when a costumed superhero does appear, things start to get creaky, because it&#8217;s a guy in a silly suit (although they didn&#8217;t do that bad a job). Looking at earlier examples, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flash_(TV_series)" target="_blank"><em>The Flash</em></a> was stuck in a bizarre muscle suit in 1990, and the less said about the 1997 attempt at a live-action <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_League_of_America_(TV_movie)" target="_blank"><em>Justice League of America</em></a>, the better.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/batman.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1769" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/batman.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="412" /></a>The prime example is <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_(film)" target="_blank">The Dark Knight</a></em>. I&#8217;m a Batman fan and I love this film&#8230; but Batman himself is a bit silly. When he sticks to the shadows like he should, no problem. But there is one surprising scene where he terrorises The Joker in a police interview room. A <em>brightly lit</em> police interview room. The Joker here looks amazing, as tailor-made purple suit aside, he is just wearing clothes. But in the glare of the fluorescent strips, Batman looks very, very silly. An interesting experiment in creating a more comic book-like Batman is the fan film <a href="http://www.collorastudios.com/projects/bde/bdemain.htm" target="_blank"><em>Batman: Dead End</em></a>, which features a Batman in grey spandex fighting&#8230; erm, aliens (as in <em>Aliens</em> aliens). Okay, so the story is a little odd, but Batman looks pretty good. However, sticking an actor in skintight lycra causes all sorts of problems with movement, result in the need for careful choreography to avoid unsightly creases and bulges. The forthcoming <em><a href="http://greenlanternmovie.warnerbros.com/" target="_blank">Green Lantern</a></em> film is avoiding this by using an entirely CG costume, but from the trailer it looks a bit peculiar (although it would help if the eyes of the mask were whited out, like in the comic).</p>
<p>Of course, I&#8217;m generalising. There are exceptions. Marvel seem to be doing a better job. <em><a href="http://ironmanmovie.marvel.com/" target="_blank">Iron Man</a></em> looks amazing, by virtue of the fact that the suit is hard, metallic, robotic. The best example of successful live-action superhero costuming might be seen in the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_films" target="_blank">X-Men</a></em> films. Here, brightly coloured spandex is swapped for dark leather which looks great and, importantly, moves well, despite Logan&#8217;s initial dismissal of the rack of jumpsuits. <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(film)" target="_blank">Spider-man</a></em> likewise is pretty slick, if a little CG-friendly. Back in DC land, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_film" target="_blank">Watchmen</a></em> too manages it admirably, with the current crop of heroes looking pretty cool while their predecessors, very cleverly, were clad in rather more home-spun costumes. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonah_Hex_(film)" target="_blank"><em>Jonah Hex</em></a> might have been a train wreck of a film but it looked pretty good, but then Hollywood has a long and glorious history of Westerns and, like the Joker in <em>Batman</em> and everyone in <em>Heroes</em>, the people in Jonah&#8217;s world just wear normal, if customised, clothes.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s this got to do with <em>The Cape</em> and <em>Young Justice</em>? Well, <em>Young Justice</em> is better than <em>The Cape</em> in all respects, and is shaping up to be one of the best DC animated series in a long while. But visually, it is just so much better than <em>The Cape</em>. Superheroes just <em>work</em> in animation, which is perhaps not surprising given the ease of transition from static comic book pages to moving animated scenes. The inhabitants of the DCU, at least, have never looked better than in <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_League_(TV_series)" target="_blank">Justice League/Justice League Unlimited</a></em>. Any impracticalities or craziness in superhero costume design that just fail in the real world fit perfectly into animation, just as they do on the comic book page. It&#8217;s the same when you&#8217;re reading prose superhero fiction &#8211; as a reader you&#8217;re in control of the action, and everything looks just tickety-boo.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/young-justice-image-cartoon-network-high-res-poster.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1771" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/young-justice-image-cartoon-network-high-res-poster.jpg" alt="" width="547" height="388" /></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately/fortunately (delete as applicable) I&#8217;d say <em>The Cape</em> is set for cancellation before the season is out. Hopefully <em>Young Justice </em>will settle in for a long run, but on the basis of the double-length pilot episode, its well deserved. Looks aren&#8217;t everything &#8211; far from it, in fact &#8211; but certainly <em>The Cape</em> is not a great example of live-action superhero design.</p>
<p>Now if NBC were looking for a circus-themed superhero, why didn&#8217;t they just commission a live-action series of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadman" target="_blank"><em>Deadman</em></a>?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[With "Tangled", Disney has introduced another princess into their little harem. While the film definitely has its good points -- including a duel between a man and a horse -- as an adult, I found too many things wrong with it to rate it more than 2.5 stars.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For as long as my daughter has been alive, I&#8217;ve pledged not to be one of <em>those</em> parents &#8212; you know, the ones who bring kids to inappropriate films<a href="#jr_28days">*</a>, or bring kids with inappropriate behavior to films.</p>
<p>Well, we managed for four years. But when my daughter&#8217;s best friend&#8217;s mom suggested we all get together and see &#8220;Tangled&#8221;, I couldn&#8217;t very well say no. And off we went.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ea_tangledposter.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1755" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ea_tangledposter-202x300.png" alt="" width="202" height="300" /></a>&#8220;Tangled&#8221; is your standard modern-day-Disney riff on the old &#8220;Rapunzel&#8221; story. In this version, however, Rapunzel&#8217;s parents are the king and queen, and they didn&#8217;t need an enchantress to help conceive her. Instead, the enchantress has been hiding a magical flower which bestows eternal youth and health. But when the queen falls ill late in her pregnancy, her soldiers find the flower and she drinks a potion made of it. Her illness is cured, and when Rapunzel is born, the baby&#8217;s magical hair can cure anyone who knows the secret song. At first the enchantress just wants to steal a lock of Rapunzel&#8217;s hair, but when she finds out it only works if the magic is freely given, she steals the baby.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 18 or so years, to Rapunzel&#8217;s 18th birthday. She&#8217;s been locked in a tower all this time, thinking the enchantress (Mother Gothel) is her real mother. But the tower isn&#8217;t a terrible place; other than no human contact with anyone other than Mother Gothel, Rapunzel is free to read, dance, paint, sing, cook, play music, or do anything else that suits her. However, for her birthday all she wants is to see the floating lights &#8212; a huge flock of floating lanterns released on the birthday of the lost princess. Mother Gothel says no, and Rapunzel resigns herself to her fate.</p>
<p>And then Flynn Rider, a thief, shows up. He, along with some henchmen, stole the lost princess&#8217;s crown, but when the palace guards get too close, he escapes and stumbles upon the tower. Rapunzel promptly hits him with a cast-iron frying pan, makes a deal with him &#8212; &#8220;you guide me to see the lights, and I&#8217;ll give you back your satchel, which you seem so very intent on retrieving&#8221; &#8212; and off they go on a madcap adventure full of singing, amusing animals, derring-do, and, because it&#8217;s Disney, love between the rascally-yet-kindhearted male character and the naive-yet-courageous princess just on the cusp of legal adulthood.</p>
<p>The animation in &#8220;Tangled&#8221; definitely lives up to the Disney name &#8212; the lighting, color, art, and movement are gorgeously-done. However, I was less than impressed with some of the voice synching &#8212; there were areas I definitely noted that didn&#8217;t look quite right. The music was also very good, for what it was &#8212; audio wallpaper, except for the singing parts &#8212; but it isn&#8217;t a soundtrack I want to buy instantly (compared to, let&#8217;s say, &#8220;Stardust&#8221;, where I actually paused the DVD to go on iTunes and buy the soundtrack right away). The songs didn&#8217;t blow me away either, except for the first two numbers &#8212; Rapunzel&#8217;s song about her day, and Mother Gothel&#8217;s &#8220;Mother Knows Best&#8221;. I feel kind of bad saying that because I&#8217;m actually related to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Slater">the lyricist</a> (he&#8217;s my cousin) and if you don&#8217;t go see the movie or buy the soundtrack that probably has some impact on how much he gets paid, but I&#8217;m not going to lie to you. The duet between Rapunzel and Flynn wasn&#8217;t all that inspired, and the song about the henchmen and their dreams wasn&#8217;t all that different from any other song like it in any other princess-centered animated film. Fortunately, there aren&#8217;t <em>that</em> many songs in the film.</p>
<p>The cast for the film was rather small &#8212; in fact, the king and queen don&#8217;t have any lines at all. Mandy Moore plays Rapunzel, and she&#8217;s quite good. Zachary Levi (Chuck from &#8220;Chuck&#8221;) is Flynn, and you can just hear him playing half the lines as Charles Carmichael<a href="#jr_carm">***</a>. Donna Murphy (Picard&#8217;s love interest in &#8220;Star Trek: Insurrection&#8221;) is Mother Gothel, and she&#8217;s clearly having a good time doing the role. Ron Perlman, Jeffrey Tambor, and Brad Garrett also appear. The best acting, however, comes from the obligatory Disney animal characters. First is Pascal, Rapunzel&#8217;s pet chameleon, who conveys a wide range of emotion with only his eyes and tail, and gets to stick his tongue into&#8230; well, you&#8217;ll just have to see it. And second is Maximus, the horse of the captain of the guard. He <em>really</em> steals the show. &#8220;Played&#8221; as more of a large dog than a horse, he has some of the best moments in the film. I mean, it is a Disney film; one thing they know how to do is animal characters. His duel with Flynn is one of the most hilarious things I&#8217;ve seen this year.</p>
<p>One thing I do want to talk about before I close is death. This film contains three direct references to death &#8212; two characters actually die, and you also see a hangman&#8217;s noose as one character is led off to be executed. I saw this film with a four-and-a-half-year-old and a three-year-and-eleven-month-old. The latter child I think handled it better because she&#8217;s seen a lot of Disney films, but my daughter hasn&#8217;t really been exposed to death beyond the passing of one of our cats a year or so ago. It was hard to explain to her what the hangman&#8217;s noose was and why the character was so afraid to see it, and it was even harder to make sure she understood why the other two characters died. One of their deaths was the classic Disney &#8220;cursed by their own hubris&#8221;, but the other was&#8230; well, I&#8217;m not going to mince words: someone got stabbed. The film is rated PG for &#8220;brief mild violence&#8221;, so I <em>guess</em> someone being stabbed to death qualifies as mild these days, but I really didn&#8217;t expect it. My daughter wasn&#8217;t traumatized or anything, and the story does have a happy ending (it <em>is</em> a Disney animated film), but it&#8217;s something to think about if you&#8217;re bringing a young child.</p>
<p>Also, make sure your child understands the concept of being kidnapped as a baby and raised by an evil enchantress who only seems like a nice person, or else you&#8217;ll be answering questions throughout the entire film. As I said before, Mother Gothel isn&#8217;t really evil&#8230; at least, not until Rapunzel defies her and leaves the tower.</p>
<p>And finally, not that it really matters, but there&#8217;s a huge plot hole in the film: what exactly is Mother Gothel <em>doing</em> with her eternal youth and good health? Just&#8230; living forever? Seems kind of silly to me. What&#8217;s the point of having those things if you don&#8217;t use them? It&#8217;s never addressed, and as an adult, it bothers me. Kids won&#8217;t mind, though.</p>
<p>Overall I enjoyed the film, although I&#8217;m kind of miffed that I paid $26.50 for it (two adults at $9.50 and one child at $7.50). I give it 2.5 stars if you&#8217;re an adult, and 3.5 if you&#8217;re a kid &#8212; this is the kind of stuff kids love these days, apparently, and I can&#8217;t imagine any kids going and not enjoying themselves. Still, it&#8217;s PG for a reason, so make sure your child understands the Disney interpretations of kidnapping and death before plunking them down. It&#8217;s 100 minutes long, too, which makes me happy &#8212; I hate paying theaters for anything under 90.</p>
<p><a name="jr_28days">*</a> <em>When I saw </em>28 Days Later<em>, there was a woman there with a child who couldn&#8217;t have been more than six. And as you know if you&#8217;ve seen it, the film is full of violent images and, in the very first scene, Cillian Murphy&#8217;s penis<a href="#jr_cmp">**</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>On a Blade of Grass</strong><br />
By Tim Pratt</p>
<p>&#8220;Interstellar war is about as exciting as playing chess by mail.&#8221; The guy who said that had been leaning into the bar for so long I thought his chest might fuse with the wood. I drifted over, because he wasn&#8217;t a regular, and I was bored with all my regulars and their regular bullshit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who plays chess by mail anymore?&#8221; I said. &#8220;With the &#8216;net and all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody. Guys in jail maybe, I don&#8217;t know. Because it&#8217;s boring. My point. Inefficient and slow. Just like this war.&#8221; He tapped his glass meaningfully. He was rumpled and sleep-creased and middle-aged and smelly, but a better class of smelly than my usual crowd &#8212; like working-all-night-sweaty smelly, not sitting-around-all-day smelly. Long enough tending bar and you can tell the difference.</p>
<p>I refilled his glass. He was a pretty good drinker, but the little guys often are. &#8220;They say by the time our warships get out there, to their homeworld, the Phages might even be extinct. Like, just from natural processes, long timescales, like that. Or they might&#8217;ve evolved into something new, something that doesn&#8217;t&#8230; you know&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to eat us?&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/2011/01/20/ep276-on-a-blade-of-grass/">Read More&#8230;</a></p>
<p><span id="more-1790"></span></p>
<p>The guy shook his head. &#8220;The aliens don&#8217;t want to eat us. That was my, what do you call it. Epiphany. They don&#8217;t want to eat us any more than we want to explore brave new frontiers. All that, eating and exploring, it&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s just  <em>incidental</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty sure they want to eat us. Being as, the first time we encountered them, they ate us.&#8221; I polished a glass, not because the glass was dirty &#8212; it&#8217;s self-cleaning nanoglass, I run a quality establishment &#8212; but because it&#8217;s traditional and makes the customers feel like the world isn&#8217;t rushing past them at a billion miles per second. Well. Metaphorically. Nothing moves that fast, because it&#8217;s faster than the speed of light, and if things could move faster than the speed of light, this interstellar war would be a lot less boring. At least me and any descendants I was likely to know personally would be dead long before any counterattack hit Earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know much about parasites?&#8221; the guy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh. When my wife was pregnant, she made me scoop the shit out of the cat boxes, so she wouldn&#8217;t get, what do you call it, toxoplasmosis. That&#8217;s a parasite, right?&#8221; I mused. &#8220;You know, I&#8217;m still the one scooping the cat boxes, and our kid&#8217;s six years old now. I keep saying we should get nanolitter, but that one cat in Germany got dissolved when the stuff malfunctioned, my wife says she won&#8217;t risk it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The guy frowned, like my cat shit stuff had derailed him, but he leaned in deeper and poked the bar with his finger. &#8220;Toxoplasmosis. Good example. Yeah, dangerous for women if they get their first exposure when they&#8217;re pregnant, it can hurt the baby, right, but fact is your wife probably already has it. A third of the people on this planet have the parasite already. Hell, in France, it&#8217;s close to ninety percent. Not so many here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No shit?&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, see, the parasite doesn&#8217;t just make you sick. Toxoplasmosis, a lot of times, you don&#8217;t get sick at all. But it <em>changes</em> you. Women infected with it, when they have babies, they have more boys than girls. No one knows why. The parasites can change your behavior, too, they make cysts in your brain, alter your personality. They make men more promiscuous and less jealous. They make people less, how do they say it, &#8216;novelty seeking.&#8217; Men think women infected with toxoplasmosis are more attractive. Infected women are definitely nicer, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My wife is hot,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s because she&#8217;s got cysts in her brain. But if a third of the people on Earth have it&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You see? Whole <em>cultures</em> could be affected by a parasite. Mass behavioral changes. Insidious. And toxoplasmosis, it&#8217;s a parasite that lives in multiple hosts. Starts out in rats and mice. And it changes them &#8212; makes them less afraid. Specifically, less afraid of cats. The infected rats don&#8217;t run away when they smell cats, so they&#8217;re more likely to get eaten by cats, and that&#8217;s great for the parasite, because it wants to live inside a cat&#8217;s guts, that&#8217;s where the parasite can reproduce. They hijack the rats. They just use the rats as a means to an end. Most of the creatures on this planet are just, are just <em>vectors</em> for some parasite.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How you know so much about this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a parasitologist. A <em>rogue</em> parasitologist.&#8221; He lifted his glass and giggled and I thought maybe I&#8217;d cut him off after this one. &#8220;I have a controversial hypothesis. Grant money&#8217;s hard to come by &#8212; I just lost the last of my funding, because I was dumb enough to call up the UN Security Council and tell them my epiphany. Would you like to hear it? My hypothesis?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I bet you&#8217;d like to tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the human urge to explore new frontiers is a <em>bug</em>, not a feature.&#8221; He had the same kind of crazy intent eyes my regular Eddie McMurray got when he started talking about his horse race betting system. &#8220;Exploring is dumb. It&#8217;s dangerous. If you&#8217;ve got a decent life in your cushy valley, why the crazy urge to strike out into the wilderness and seek new vistas? Early explorers tend to die a lot. I don&#8217;t just mean people exploring like the New World back in the old days, or doing undersea exploration. We have manned space travel now. That&#8217;s idiotic. I mean, space. It&#8217;s fundamentally inimical to human life. Why the hell would we want to go there? But so many people, scientists and novelists and thinkers, Hawking and Sagan and Heinlein, they say it&#8217;s imperative we go into space, that we must, that it&#8217;s what humankind is _destined_ for.&#8221; He tapped the side of his head. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a parasite. I think most humans have something, some tiny bug, something that gets into us when we&#8217;re born, _before_ we&#8217;re born, that makes us want to explore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay. You&#8217;re the expert. Me, I never wanted to explore brave new worlds.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shrugged. &#8220;Maybe the toxoplasmosis damped down your novelty-seeking behavior. Who knows, maybe parasites in cat shit destroying our urge for the new could have been the salvation of mankind, if we&#8217;d achieved a hundred percent infection worldwide, but&#8230; Too late now. We&#8217;ve climbed the blade of grass. The sheep have eaten us.&#8221; He tapped his glass again. I pretended not to notice.</p>
<p>&#8220;You lost me there, pal. We&#8217;re sheep now? Or are we grass?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re <em>ants</em>. Listen: Dicrocoelium dendriticum. A parasite that lives in sheep. The parasite lays eggs, which the sheep shits out. Now, sheep don&#8217;t eat their own shit, so how do the little baby parasites get back inside a nice woolly baa-baa belly to spawn their own generation of kiddies? I&#8217;ll tell you. Snails come along and eat the sheep shit, along with the parasite eggs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Circle of life,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The parasites hatch and get expelled in the snail&#8217;s slime trail. Ants love snail slime, they eat that stuff up like, like I eat up these peanuts.&#8221; He jiggled the bowl of bar snacks before him. &#8220;So now the parasites are inside the ants. But they&#8217;re still fucked, because sheep don&#8217;t eat ants &#8212; they eat <em>grass</em>. So what does the parasite do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Makes the ants climb the blades of grass.&#8221;</p>
<p>He blinked. &#8220;How. How&#8217;d you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said it earlier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right. Right. The parasite gets into the ant&#8217;s brain. Normal ants aren&#8217;t stupid, at least not about ant stuff, so they stay on the ground during the day and go home to their nests at night. But after the parasite takes over, the ants have this uncontrollable urge to climb as high as they can when night falls. They climb to the top of a stalk of grass when it gets cold in the evening and just cling there &#8217;til it gets warm again in the morning, then go back about their business. Except for the ones who get eaten by grazing sheep first thing in the morning. They die. But the parasite doesn&#8217;t. It lives on, comfortable and happy in a sheep&#8217;s guts.&#8221; He shook his head and tapped his glass, more insistently. &#8220;Parasites are the secret masters of the world. Not just the world. The <em>universe</em>. We think so highly of intelligence, like intelligence is the pinnacle of evolution, but that&#8217;s crap. Parasites use our own intelligence against us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So what do you mean when you say we&#8217;re ants?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah. My hypothesis. We went into space, right? We sent a ship with some people on it as fast as we possibly could, out, exploring. Because the human spirit strives for greater knowledge etc.? No. Bullshit. Because some unknown parasite made us want to explore. And we found aliens! Aliens as different from us as a sheep is from an ant &#8212; which isn&#8217;t as different as it seems, I mean, both carbon-based, they can eat each other, right? But they look pretty goddamn different. And those aliens tore open our ship like a bag of potato chips and ate the people they found inside. Why? Who knows why. Maybe they just eat everything. Maybe they&#8217;ve got some parasite of their own, something that makes their first reaction to new things <em>consumption</em>. Maybe that&#8217;s how they, I don&#8217;t know, say hello, by consuming flesh and analyzing it chemically.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are lots of theories. I&#8217;ve seen &#8216;em on TV. But who cares? They ate us. That&#8217;s war right there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Slow, boring, multi-generational war. But my theory, my hypothesis, is that the parasite, the one that makes humans want to explore, that parasite needs to complete its life cycle &#8212; or at least continue its lifecycle &#8212; in the gut of the aliens we call the Phage. Or maybe in the gut of something that eats the excrement of a Phage. Who knows? Parasite life cycles can be complicated. I think the whole human urge to explore is just part of a parasite&#8217;s plan to get into the belly of an alien.&#8221;</p>
<p>I poured myself a whiskey, and then, because it seemed like the thing to do, I refilled his glass too. &#8220;That&#8217;s fucked up,&#8221; I said at last. &#8220;You got, you know, proof?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Needed to do more research. But I thought it was important &#8212; I mean, we sent warships! To their homeworld! Or what we think is their homeworld &#8212; so I went to the military with my theory, and, kaboom. No more grant money. &#8216;That&#8217;s crazy,&#8217; they said. &#8216;You&#8217;re saying we have no free will,&#8217; they said. &#8216;We thank you for your contributions to science,&#8217; they said. And here I am. Drinking my woes away. Fuck it. I&#8217;ll be dead, anyway, before the shit starts raining down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was your, you know. Solution?&#8221; A guy like this, I figured, would have a solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are ways to kill parasites. If I could find it. If I could find out what it <em>is</em>. Wipe it out, parasite genocide, and maybe after that people&#8230; would be content. Go back to living in their valleys. Stop pushing and pushing and taking and taking. Stop going into space. Stop getting eaten. But it&#8217;s too late. We sent warships. The Phages will come back. They&#8217;ll eat our great-great-great-exponential-great grandchildren. All hail the parasites.&#8221; He opened his wallet and put some money on the bar, a pretty good tip, I guess for all my listening. &#8220;G&#8217;night.&#8221;</p>
<p>He left. Eventually my regulars left too, and I closed up the bar. Out in the parking lot, I tilted my head back and looked up, into that big black deep sky full of stars and planets and black holes and pulsars and dust and comets and asteroids and man-eating monsters. I&#8217;d never thought about it before, really, but I had to admit.</p>
<p>It all looked pretty inviting.</p>

On a Blade of Grass
By Tim Pratt

"Interstellar war is about as exciting as playing chess by mail." The guy who said that had been leaning into the bar for so long I thought his chest might fuse with the wood. I drifted over, because he wasn't a regular, and I was bored with all my regulars and their regular bullshit.

"Who plays chess by mail anymore?" I said. "With the 'net and all."

"Nobody. Guys in jail maybe, I don't know. Because it's boring. My point. Inefficient and slow. Just like this war." He tapped his glass meaningfully. He was rumpled and sleep-creased and middle-aged and smelly, but a better class of smelly than my usual crowd -- like working-all-night-sweaty smelly, not sitting-around-all-day smelly. Long enough tending bar and you can tell the difference.

I refilled his glass. He was a pretty good drinker, but the little guys often are. "They say by the time our warships get out there, to their homeworld, the Phages might even be extinct. Like, just from natural processes, long timescales, like that. Or they might've evolved into something new, something that doesn't... you know..."

"Want to eat us?"

Read More...



The guy shook his head. "The aliens don't want to eat us. That was my, what do you call it. Epiphany. They don't want to eat us any more than we want to explore brave new frontiers. All that, eating and exploring, it's just, it's just  incidental."

"I'm pretty sure they want to eat us. Being as, the first time we encountered them, they ate us." I polished a glass, not because the glass was dirty -- it's self-cleaning nanoglass, I run a quality establishment -- but because it's traditional and makes the customers feel like the world isn't rushing past them at a billion miles per second. Well. Metaphorically. Nothing moves that fast, because it's faster than the speed of light, and if things could move faster than the speed of light, this interstellar war would be a lot less boring. At least me and any descendants I was likely to know personally would be dead long before any counterattack hit Earth.

"You know much about parasites?" the guy said.

"Eh. When my wife was pregnant, she made me scoop the shit out of the cat boxes, so she wouldn't get, what do you call it, toxoplasmosis. That's a parasite, right?" I mused. "You know, I'm still the one scooping the cat boxes, and our kid's six years old now. I keep saying we should get nanolitter, but that one cat in Germany got dissolved when the stuff malfunctioned, my wife says she won't risk it."

The guy frowned, like my cat shit stuff had derailed him, but he leaned in deeper and poked the bar with his finger. "Toxoplasmosis. Good example. Yeah, dangerous for women if they get their first exposure when they're pregnant, it can hurt the baby, right, but fact is your wife probably already has it. A third of the people on this planet have the parasite already. Hell, in France, it's close to ninety percent. Not so many here."

"No shit?" I said.

"And, see, the parasite doesn't just make you sick. Toxoplasmosis, a lot of times, you don't get sick at all. But it changes you. Women infected with it, when they have babies, they have more boys than girls. No one knows why. The parasites can change your behavior, too, they make cysts in your brain, alter your personality. They make men more promiscuous and less jealous. They make people less, how do they say it, 'novelty seeking.' Men think women infected with toxoplasmosis are more attractive. Infected women are definitely nicer, anyhow."

"My wife is hot," I said. "I don't think it's because she's got cysts in he</itunes:summary>

		<description><![CDATA[Two years after its U.S. release, I had occasion to watch the film "Ponyo", by acclaimed Japanese writer-director Hayao Miyazaki. I watched it with my four-year-old daughter, and it's now her favorite film. But if you want more of a review than that, read on.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a year ago, I started hearing buzz about a Japanese animated film called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponyo">Ponyo</a>. I knew it was directed by Hayao Miyazaki, known in the U.S. for, among other things, &#8220;Nausicaa: Valley of the Wind&#8221;, &#8220;My Neighbor Totoro&#8221;, &#8220;Spirited Away&#8221;, and &#8220;Princess Mononoke&#8221;. My first exposure to Miyazaki was with &#8220;Mononoke&#8221;, and while I enjoyed the animation and the story, the ending threw me a bit. Then, later, when I saw &#8220;Spirited Away&#8221;, I felt the same &#8212; mostly starting when the main character took the train away from where she was working.</p>
<p>But then I heard people saying that the first 20 minutes or so of &#8220;Ponyo&#8221; made no sense, and were just beautifully-drawn sea scenes. So I mentally shelved it and figured I&#8217;d come back to it at some point.</p>
<p>Enter Netflix, which I just subscribed to. Netflix, which had &#8220;Ponyo&#8221; in HD.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ea_ponyoposter.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1743" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ea_ponyoposter-202x300.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="300" /></a>Well, one Saturday night, my daughter wanted to watch a movie, so I suggested &#8220;Ponyo&#8221; &#8212; it was age-appropriate, and contained nothing more objectionable than occasional scary images (according to what I read before showing it to her). We had dinner, settled in, and began to watch.</p>
<p>She was hooked. Completely captivated. And so was I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ponyo&#8221; is a riff on the classic &#8220;Little Mermaid&#8221; tale of the fish who wants to be human. However, in this story, the fish who wants to be human is the half-human-half-fish daughter of a human sorcerer and the goddess of mercy. While exploring the sea near a Japanese harbor town, she is caught up in a net that is dredging the sea bottom, cleaning up trash, and eventually washes up in the shallows near the home of five-year-old Sosuke. Sosuke saves her from the glass bottle that&#8217;s got her trapped, and there he names her Ponyo (her given name is Brunhilde). Later, Sosuke takes Ponyo to his school, shows her to his friends and the old women next door (his school is beside a Senior Center, where his mother works), and eventually loses her to the sea when her father uses magic to retrieve her.</p>
<p>And then it gets weird. Because, you see, Ponyo has fallen in love with Sosuke and will do anything to be with him, including defying her father, stealing his magic elixirs, and transforming into a human girl. In doing so, she creates a massive storm which nearly washes Sosuke&#8217;s mother&#8217;s car off the road and ends up submerging the entire town in what is some of the coolest artwork I&#8217;ve seen in anime lately.</p>
<p>Because &#8220;Ponyo&#8221; is directed at children, you know the ending will be happy. But there&#8217;s plenty of adventure to be had, lots of humor &#8212; once Ponyo gets to Sosuke&#8217;s house, there&#8217;s several moments my daughter and I both LOL&#8217;d at &#8212; and and ending that, while somewhat neatly-wrapped-up (what about all those flooded houses and shops?), is still satisfying.</p>
<p>The artwork in &#8220;Ponyo&#8221; is beautiful, as befits a Miyazaki film, and you really feel like you&#8217;re in that harbor town with Sosuke. The mother, Lisa, is somewhat cliched (think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misato_Katsuragi">Misato Katsuragi</a> at her most stressed-out), but she&#8217;s a good character nonetheless. The seniors with whom she works provide plenty of comic relief, as does some of what Ponyo&#8217;s father gets up to. And then, when the town is submerged, the adventure Sosuke and Ponyo go on is quite a cool sequence.</p>
<p>Because the film was made by a Japanese studio and written by a Japanese writer, there are some things the characters do that don&#8217;t track. It&#8217;s hard to explain to my four-year-old why Sosuke&#8217;s mother is leaving him alone for the night &#8212; from what I know of Japanese culture, kids are a bit more self-sufficient than American kids of the same age, but still, Sosuke is only five &#8212; and the food they eat is very different from what she has in the morning. I mean, I&#8217;ve never given my daughter a ham sandwich for breakfast<a href="#jr_ham">*</a>. She also didn&#8217;t understand the supermarket, and I don&#8217;t think she comprehended that the reason none of the letters looked familiar was because it was another language. But these are small things.</p>
<p>The voice acting was probably the weakest part of the film, at least for me. Tina Fey didn&#8217;t do a very good job as Lisa, and the girl who played Ponyo (the youngest Cyrus sister) had a very annoying voice. Of course, that was part of her character, but still&#8230; annoying. The youngest Jonas brother played Sosuke, and he was all right. Liam Neeson played Ponyo&#8217;s father, and while he sounded mostly like a put-upon Irish father, that really wasn&#8217;t right for the role &#8212; despite the character&#8217;s appearance. The best voice acting by far was done by the women who played the ladies at the senior center &#8212; Betty White and Lily Tomlin.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a Miyazaki completist, or you want to see a really beautifully-drawn film, I&#8217;d say you should watch &#8220;Ponyo&#8221;. Your younger kids will like it, and older ones will sit through it without too much difficulty. At least, the first time. I liked it for the artwork, and for its humor. But overall, I don&#8217;t think it was as strong as some of Miyazaki&#8217;s other films, despite the strength of Sosuke&#8217;s character and the way he sees the world he lives in. In some ways the hyperactivity of Ponyo&#8217;s character and viewpoint actually detract from the story as a whole, and it&#8217;s at its best when Sosuke is the center of attention. Still, I&#8217;d say it deserves most of the praise it&#8217;s received, despite my problems with it.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a kid, it probably gets four stars (out of four). My daughter certainly considers it her new favorite, and loves to sing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0lk-GEhYdY">the theme song</a>. But for adult audiences, I&#8217;d consider it a three-star film.</p>
<p><a name="jr_ham">*</a> <em>Actually, we keep kosher, so she&#8217;ll never have one anyway, but it&#8217;s the principle of the thing.</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My science-fiction-loving friends have often heard me claim that, if Robert Heinlein was alive today, he would be very upset with us for not having colonized the moon or other planets. I&#8217;m still pretty upset about it myself. Only a few hundred living humans have ever been in space, and the American media still looks disdainfully upon anyone willing to spend the time and money to go up with another country&#8217;s space shuttle.</p>
<p>Even the term itself is un-futuristic. &#8220;Space shuttle.&#8221; It sounds like a fancy name for the tram that takes you to the different parking lots at Disney.</p>
<p>But this week, I realized that we really do live in the future.</p>
<p>I personally live in the greater Atlanta, Ga., area, and we recently were held in the icy grip of a winter storm that cancelled school for a full week, left thousands stuck on their couches and not at work, and generally made people ecstatic for one day and morose for the next four.</p>
<p><a title="Welcome to HothLanta by grabbingsand, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grabbingsand/5350448862/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5049/5350448862_91a9dfba7e.jpg" alt="Welcome to HothLanta" width="500" height="311" /></a></p>
<p>I happen to work for a company that provided me with a brand-new Macbook (as of November) and a way to access all the programs I need to do my job from literally anywhere with an internet connection. So, while thousands of my co-workers were stuck at home doing nothing, I got work done all week. I worked in my kitchen, I worked in my basement, I worked in my living room with my feet up. I stayed in contact with co-workers via instant messages, I took conference calls at my house, and I fulfilled dozens of work orders.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t have done this ten years ago. But now, I live in the future.</p>
<p>For days, meteorologists used computer models to warn me the storm was coming. I got information from television, radio, and the internet. I was able to entertain my child using video games, movies, recorded television, and her very own computer (my four-year-old daughter has a laptop with a Linux install; that amazes me from time to time). I kept up on what other people were doing using Twitter and Facebook, and even got on board with the hashtag #hothlanta, creating a community amid a paralyzing storm system.</p>
<p>A century ago, if a storm had hit, I might not have known about it until it was too late, and I certainly wouldn&#8217;t have kept as busy as I did. But now, I live in the future.</p>
<p>Despite being trapped in my house, a prisoner to unsafe driving conditions, I still managed to cook and eat meals, stay in contact with my extended family, keep up with the latest news, complete my assigned work tasks, and even watch three full seasons of &#8220;The IT Crowd&#8221;.</p>
<p>When Hurricane Andrew hit south Florida (I lived there at the time), the only information we got was from the radio. After it passed, we had no idea when the power would be back on or if it was safe to leave our neighborhood. But this week I found out all those things before even putting on my jacket. Because I live in the future.</p>
<p>What really sealed it for me was this: on Thursday, I was working in my kitchen and wanted to listen to some music. Normally I&#8217;d put on last.fm or iTunes radio, but I only have a limited amount of bandwidth in the house. So I took out my iPad, activated the Remote app, and started playing music from my personal library. Without getting up off my ass, I controlled my personal laptop in the next room, told it what music to play and how loud, and within moments was enjoying, among other things, the London Symphony Orchestra performing the soundtrack to &#8220;Superman: the Movie&#8221;.</p>
<p>I live in the future. And as much as I complain, I kind of like it here.</p>
<p>I wonder what I&#8217;m going to do tomorrow.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Monster-Hunter-International.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1730" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Monster-Hunter-International.jpg" alt="Monster Hunter International" width="163" height="248" /></a>I had a warm spot in my heart for Larry Correia after reading his HK rant. (“Because you suck. And we hate you.”) Unfortunately, I decided to read his novel, <em>Monster Hunter International</em>. This book was originally self-published, and owes its success to Mr. Correia’s marketing instincts. I don’t have space to cover all the flaws in this book, so I’ll just hit the highlights. Because it was self-published and only later picked up by Baen, <em>Monster Hunter International</em> shows no sign of an editor’s pen. The characters are flat. The prose is stale and repetitive. The plot reads like something intended for a weekend of tabletop gaming, complete with prophetic visions from the storyteller to keep the protagonists on track.</p>
<p>The company called Monster Hunter International was founded when a group of good Southern boys got a lynch mob together in order to drive some unsavory elements (read: vampires) out of their town. I wish I was kidding. In the years since, Monster Hunter has made its founder&#8217;s family rich by collecting government-sponsored bounties on supernatural creatures like werewolves, zombies, and vampires. These days, the only thing they fear is the EPA (and Fish and Wildlife, and OSHA, and…).</p>
<p>Our hero, Owen Pitt (brother of the heavy metal artist Mosh Pitt &#8212; not kidding about that one, either), gets involved in the monster hunting business when he defeats his evil-boss-turned-werewolf in single combat. Afterwards, he is visited at his home by Monster Hunter International&#8217;s recruitment team, including one Julie Shackleford, who tells him that not only is he the first man in history to kill a werewolf with his bare hands, but that his scores in various firearm competitions are even better than hers! Also, his college degree proves that he is a genius. Owen decides that he is in love (though whether with her or her handguns is sometimes an open question). He expresses his love by staring at her a lot, and when that doesn&#8217;t work, by pretending to be her friend.</p>
<p>I decided to read this book based on the strength of its action scenes, but to my dismay I found that the narrative is dominated by lectures. The hundred pages or so that pass between the werewolf fight and the first vampire fight are filled with Owen’s monster hunter training. We are introduced to some more monster hunters, whom the reader might be tempted to worry about if Mr. Correia had the fortitude to kill his characters. In training, Owen proves that he is the best at every possible thing (except running), earning the admiration of all the instructors. Multi-page monologues leave the reader with only one questions: Who will be beating our hero with the exposition bat this time?</p>
<p>When the book finally gets back to the action, it&#8217;s a mess of vampires on a cargo ship. Owen saves everyone from the cowardly French vampire, and is left for dead by Julie&#8217;s asshole boyfriend (and who didn&#8217;t see that one coming?). We learn the first rule of monster hunting: Any problem can be solved by getting a bigger gun. In Owen&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s a fully automatic cut-down combat shotgun with a spring-loaded bayonet and optional grenade launcher. (&#8220;How many gun laws does this break?&#8221; &#8220;All of them.&#8221;) The action scenes are precise and well-scripted, but I was willing to put this book down at any time up to the last fifty pages. The final battle is the most interesting one in the book, but suffers from overuse of the passive voice (see: the perils of self-publishing). Finally, it turns out that women are the source of all evil.</p>
<p>Owen is not the kind of character who thinks his way out of problems. Despite being introduced as a genius, he isn’t particularly bright. He has a magical dead Jew in his head who does his thinking for him (still not kidding). Instead of figuring out the bad guy’s plans, the magical Jew dumps Owen directly into the bad guy’s head and lets him see through his eyes, removing all suspense from their later encounters. People who learn things tend to go insane, like Julie&#8217;s father.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter International</em> did not have to be seven hundred pages long. Its sequel, which I am told did benefit from the attentions of an editor, is much shorter. Not that it really matters, since I’m not going to spend any more time struggling through yet another lecture set to the sound of an entire Viking army’s worth of political axes grinding. <em>Monster Hunter International</em> is not a book for people who enjoy well-crafted prose or fast-paced action. It is not for people who don&#8217;t care about the difference between a Government .45 and a Glock. Larry Correia is writing for a specific audience, and it is clear that I am not one of them.</p>

<p><strong>Schrödinger&#8217;s Cat Lady</strong><br />
By Marjorie James</p>
<p>I got out of the car, smoothed my shirt down over my bulletproof vest, and contemplated the cats. They contemplated me right back. I sighed. I hated these jobs.</p>
<p>I opened the tiny gate to the front walk (no fence, just a gate) and made my way to the door. The house was small and tidy, a light blue bungalow with green trim and yellow curtains pulled across the windows, through which the cats were peering. It didn’t smell, which was a relief. And something of a surprise, considering the heat. It was one of those days when the world seemed to be actively rejecting human habitation, where the smog and the humidity made the air feel like warm mayonnaise. On a day like this, a cat overpopulation should be stinking to high heaven. Maybe this wasn’t for real, I hoped. It might just be some neighbor with a grudge. Couldn’t be more than a dozen cats here, max. Maybe this one wasn’t going to be that bad.</p>
<p>I have never been very good at predicting things.</p>

<p>I knocked, and waited. A few minutes later there was the sound of multiple locks being unfastened, then some more, then an abortive attempt to open the door, then one last, forgotten bolt sliding back.</p>
<p>The door opened and I was confronted by the smallest person I had ever met. The woman wouldn’t have cleared five feet without some impressive shoes and a generous hand with the measuring tape and her hands and face (the only parts of her that were visible from under the intricate layers of scarves and sweaters) were narrow and delicate. She looked up at me with what seemed to be genuine pleasure.</p>
<p>“Yes? How can I help you?”</p>
<p>“Good morning, ma’am. I’m Lieutenant Eleanor Ross from Animal Welfare. Can I talk with you for a moment?”</p>
<p>Sweat was pouring off me and pooling where my bulletproof vest squeezed against my back. I tried to subtly adjust the vest and the sweat streamed down my butt. I grimaced, and the woman noticed.</p>
<p>She smiled. “Are you afraid I’m going to shoot at you?”</p>
<p>I smiled back. “Department policy. Everyone has to wear them, at all times.”</p>
<p>“I think that’s wise. After all, you never know. I might have shot at you. Would you like to come in?”</p>
<p>I thanked her and followed her into the house. It was a modest bungalow, indistinguishable from every other house on the block, aside from the paint job and the total lack of flowers in the yard. Which is why the interior came as something of a surprise.</p>
<p>The door led to an ordinary entryway—a pair of wooden clogs on the tiled floor, a small table scattered with junk mail. But just beyond that the room opened up into something I could best describe as the bastard child of a hunting lodge and a picture I had seen once of an artist’s rendition of a Roman baths, only without the naked people.</p>
<p>There were no people at all, in fact, aside from myself and the woman, but there was a very large quantity of cats. They were everywhere, pouring out of alcoves and off of furniture—some even seemed to come straight out of the walls—and there seemed to be plenty of space for all of them. In fact, there was more than enough space, far more than was possible, given the apparent dimensions of the house.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that I might be suffering from heatstroke.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry to bother you Mrs. . . .” I looked down at my notes, which were nothing but an illegible scribble.</p>
<p>“Oh, call me Mrs. S. Everyone does. And it’s no bother, no bother at all. I get so few guests these days, and it does get lonely, you know, just me and the cats. And you seem like it would do you some good to get out of that heat.”</p>
<p>Now that she mentioned it, it was pleasantly cool inside. And not the hard, moisture-sucking coldness of summertime air-conditioning; it was cool like an afternoon breeze off the ocean.</p>
<p>I could feel my heat-tense muscles starting to relax in spite of myself.</p>
<p>Disconcerted, but grateful to not be sweating, I tried to get on with the matter at hand.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry to bother you, ma—Mrs. S.,” I repeated. “I’m afraid we’ve had some reports about a large number of cats living here.”</p>
<p>“Yes? Well, people will talk, won’t they? Can I get you something to drink?”</p>
<p>For some reason, I felt like the situation was getting away from me. “No thank you, ma’am. Are you aware the city has a limit on seven animals over five pounds allowed per household?” I glanced around a the cats, who were swarming benignly around the room. “I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask you to find new homes for some of these.”</p>
<p>“Oh, but I do. It’s just that there’s so many to save, especially during exams season.” Mrs. S leaned down and picked up a white tabby that had been untying my shoelaces. “And honestly, how can you expect me to know how much they weigh from one minute to the next?”</p>
<p>For what was approximately the ten thousandth time that day, I cursed the budget cuts that had made it necessary for officers in “non-hazardous situations” to work without a partner. I could really have used someone to turn to and mouth “What the hell?” right about now. But that wasn’t an option, so all I could do was to try and get all of the questions that were bouncing around my head to form an orderly line so I could ask them without sounding as stupid as I suddenly felt.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we go into the kitchen so we can chat?” Mrs. S said.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid there aren’t a lot of places to sit out here.”</p>
<p>I agreed, started to follow her, and promptly tripped over my shoelaces.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>It’s all wrong, I thought. And I didn’t mean the fact that I was sitting in the woman’s kitchen, with a pink compress on my forehead and a glass of exceptionally bitter iced tea in front of me. Those were just the symptoms of the wrongness, the results. The place was wrong. I had done plenty of these jobs before—dozens, at least—and I thought by now I knew what to expect. Cats, of course, and there were plenty of those here, and the Smell, which wasn’t. The Smell was dander and ammonia and overflowing litterboxes and tomcat musk and sometimes, in the worst cases, a decomposing animal. But there was none of that here; the air smelled of nothing, aside from the occasional faint whiff of sulfur. There was none of the noise, either, and one other thing. . .</p>
<p>“Do you have any kittens here?” I asked, the question butting to the front of the line without so much as an ‘excuse me.’</p>
<p>“Kittens? No, thank goodness. Most people aren’t quite that cruel.”</p>
<p>Five more questions took their place in the queue. I took a deep breath, set my notebook on the table and started calling numbers.</p>
<p>“How many cats do you have?” I asked, and silently prayed for a simple answer.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s hard to say, what with the uncertainty factor. Quite a few, I should think.”</p>
<p>There were points to question there, too, but I was on track now. ‘Not sure how many cats,’ I wrote. A fat, glossy calico chose that moment to hop up on the table and sit down on my notebook. After Mrs. S shooed it off, I added, ‘Appear to be well cared-for.’</p>
<p>“You said you rescued these cats?” I asked. “Is there an organization you’re working with?”</p>
<p>“No, there’s just me. I don’t mind it; these days I don’t have much else to do.”</p>
<p>“Where do you rescue them from?”</p>
<p>“Oh, from the boxes.”</p>
<p>“Boxes? You mean you set out traps?” There were worse things than trapping strays and finding them homes, I thought, even if you weren’t doing it totally in compliance with city ordinances.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t put them in the boxes. The people do. I just get them out before something happens.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry?”</p>
<p>Mrs. S stopped and looked at me thoughtfully. “Perhaps I had better explain it so you can understand.”</p>
<p>“Please,” I said.</p>
<p>“Well, you see, some time ago there was this man—well, actually there were many iterations of this man across multiple dimensions, but that isn’t really important right now, is it?”</p>
<p>“Of course not,” I agreed, absolutely lost.</p>
<p>“Exactly. What is important is that, to make a point, this man, or men, posed a problem. He suggested that people imagine a box, which nothing could get into or out of, with a cat in it. And then he told them to put in this box a vial of poison gas and a piece of radioactive material, and whether or not the poison gas is released depends on whether the material emits a particle over the course of an hour. There’s a fifty-fifty chance of that, you see, and the person doesn’t know if the cat is alive or dead until they open the box. He was making a point about uncertainty, of course, but to my mind, that’s no reason to go killing cats.”</p>
<p>“So, wait, people are killing cats in boxes, with radiation? Because some guy told them to? Is this some sort of cult thing?” I had dealt with plenty of crazy people in my time, but this was a new one. I hoped I wasn’t in any danger; the bit about the poison gas was a little unnerving.</p>
<p>“It’s students mostly, these days, and the occasional bored physicist. There’s one who runs through it every Friday night, eleven-thirty his time. Always the cutest little tortoiseshells.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I follow you,” I said, in what may have been the greatest understatement of my life. “Where are they getting the cats? And the boxes and all the other stuff?”</p>
<p>“Oh, they don’t get them, they invent them.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry?”</p>
<p>“They invent them,” Mrs. S repeated slowly. “They create them with their minds.”</p>
<p>“So, this is all imaginary? The cats aren’t real?” That would explain the lack of smell, I thought wildly. Though not the warm thing that had fallen asleep on my foot.</p>
<p>“Yes and no, in that order.” Mrs. S smiled as though I was a particularly slow student who was starting to come along. “The things we create in our minds have existence. Like Santa Claus. And I just can’t stand the thought of all those poor cats trapped in those boxes. You know,” she leaned in closer and spoke with urgency. “If I didn’t get to them, half of them would die. Just like that! It’s shameful.”</p>
<p>“And it’s always cats?” I asked without really thinking. I was wondering if I needed to call Social Services, for all the good that ever did. I could hardly just leave the woman here like this.</p>
<p>“Almost always. Though there have been a few dogs. And llamas, that one time. That one was interesting. Did you know that they spit? Very smart animals, but big spitters. The only one I didn’t do was the alligators. Anyone who uses alligators deserves what’s coming to them, in my opinion.”</p>
<p>“What’s coming to them? You mean, something happens?”</p>
<p>Mrs. S looked mildly shocked. “Well, you can’t just go on killing cats indefinitely.”</p>
<p>At that moment two of the cats, who had been charging around in some sort of complex chase, raced through the kitchen, bounded off my lap and went straight through the opposite wall. I stared after them, open-mouthed. Mrs. S shook her head.</p>
<p>“Oh, those two,” she said. “They just will not acknowledge solid states when they get going. Would you like some more tea?”</p>
<p>I left the house and drove myself straight to the hospital. I realized I probably should have called for a ride, but I didn’t want to try and explain myself to any more people than was absolutely necessary. I filled out the paperwork and handed it over to the nurse on duty.</p>
<p>“I hit my head,” I explained. “I think I may have a concussion.”</p>
<p>The nurse was supremely uninterested. “Have someone check on you every thirty minutes to make sure you don’t go into a coma,” she advised. “Have you lost consciousness?”</p>
<p>“No—I mean, I don’t think so.” I was uncertain enough about the events of the last hour that I wasn’t about to rule anything out. “I’d really like to get a CAT—a brain scan. To be sure.”</p>
<p>Three hours of waiting and seventeen minutes of medical procedure later, I left the hospital with a clean bill of health.</p>
<p>‘Minor bruising’ according to the doctor, who made it clear he thought I was wasting both our time. I decided not to explain about the cats that weren’t there. It didn’t seem like the moment.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>A week later, the whole thing seemed distant and silly. In fact, the more time passed, the less sure I was that I hadn’t dreamed the whole thing. I lied on the report, said no one was home when I visited (for all I knew, that might have been the truth), but that just meant I had to go back and finish the job. This time, for once, I was glad to have no one to come with me. Things might have gotten awkward, otherwise.</p>
<p>The house was exactly like I had remembered it. I rang the bell and took a deep breath. ‘I am normal,’ I told myself. ‘This is normal. There is nothing here but a normal old lady and a bunch of normal cats.’</p>
<p>It was a few minutes before the door opened and Mrs. S (I had tried to look up her name in the property records, but all of the accounts had been illegible) smiled up at me. She was wearing long leather gauntlets and a pith helmet.</p>
<p>“Why, hello! It’s Eleanor, right? Please, do come in.”</p>
<p>The interior of the house was no less bizarre than I remembered it, except that now there was the addition of a large, leafless tree in the middle of the room, surrounded by chicken wire. Which did not, in my opinion, do much to decrease the strangeness.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry about the mess,” Mrs. S was saying. “I wasn’t expecting anyone to be by. I’m afraid we’re having something of a Day.”</p>
<p>“What sort of day?” I asked, even though I knew better.</p>
<p>“Well, there’s been an iteration. And somehow, they ended up with falcons. Falcons! Honestly, who even thinks of falcons, I ask you?”</p>
<p>“I can’t imagine,” I replied, with absolute honesty.</p>
<p>“Oh, but you aren’t interested in that. You’re here about the cats, right? Do you have to weigh them?”</p>
<p>“Weigh. . . what? I’m sorry, did you say you have falcons here?”</p>
<p>Mrs. S pulled off her gloves and waved them towards the back of the house. “Eleven so far, but who knows how many there will end up being. I think the term must have just started. But no worries, I have them well-contained. They aren’t going to get anywhere near the cats.”</p>
<p>I did not know the regulations for keeping birds of prey in a private residence off the top of my head, but I suspected there was another violation here. Which, technically I ought to be pursuing. But I had been here for five minutes and I was already at the limits of my powers of comprehension and, frankly, until someone called in a complaint about falcons I was just going to pretend I hadn’t heard that part.</p>
<p>“Yes, well, I’m sorry to be bothering you again,” I said. “But I really need to talk to you about the cats. I’m afraid you just can’t keep so many of them here with you.”</p>
<p>As I spoke, the room seemed to grow even bigger, like it was mocking my words. And the truth was, even as I said it, and knew I was right, I felt ridiculous standing in this huge space, saying it wasn’t big enough. (Part of my brain was trying to ask how this was possible, and I was telling it to shut up, I had enough problems already.)</p>
<p>“I understand,” Mrs. S said. “You have to do your job. But I have a job too, you know. And it’s not like they can just go somewhere else. I do try and find them homes, but it takes some time.”</p>
<p>“These homes you find for them; where are they, if you don’t mind my asking?”</p>
<p>“Oh all sorts of places. Paintings, poems, greeting cards. But nothing where they would have to wear clothing. I really think that’s beneath their dignity, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Of course.” In fact, I had always hated pictures of cats wearing clothes, for just that reason, though I never would have expressed it.</p>
<p>At that moment a streak of gray fur bounded through the room, knocked over an end table, ricocheted off my head, scaled the chicken wire around the tree and was gone again. Mrs. S sighed and smiled.</p>
<p>“That was Heisenberg—You just can never know where he is and how fast he’s going. But he’s a good boy, really. Would you like some tea?”</p>
<p>So, for the second week in a row, I found myself sitting in the cozy kitchen, drinking tea so strong I thought I could hear my tooth enamel begging for mercy, trying to reconcile the things around me with what I knew of reality. When three cats wandered through, merged into one cat (a calico) and tried to climb my leg, I gave up. “Please think about what I told you,” I said to Mrs. S as I left. “And let me know if there’s anything I can do to help.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Mrs. S patted my arm. “You really do try, don’t you? To take care of the animals.”</p>
<p>“Someone has to, ma’am.”</p>
<p>I thought about going in for a drug test when I got back to the station, but I decided against it. Either way, it would be too much to explain.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>It was two weeks before I went back to the house. I was in my civilian clothes, having found myself with some unexpected off-duty time. I didn’t have any particular purpose for this visit—I had already written up the case as a false report, and let them do what they liked with that. If somebody had been in a position to ask me why I was there, I might have said something like “Three time’s a charm,” but the truth was, there was something about the cool house and the bitter tea that felt very welcome right about now. I guess some kinds of confusion are better than others. I rang the bell.</p>
<p>“Why, hello!” Mrs. S greeted me warmly, then stopped as she noticed my arm in its sling. “Oh, my dear, what happened?”</p>
<p>I smiled wanly. “Bad judgment call on my part. I hope I’m not bothering you. I just came by to check up on the cats.”</p>
<p>“Oh no, not at all. Please come in. Would you like some tea?”</p>
<p>In what seemed like an unreasonably short time, I was settled in the kitchen, with iced tea etching the glass in front of me and a cat sleeping lightly on the back of my chair. (I had to admit, real or not, they were some of the most contented cats I had ever encountered.)</p>
<p>“So. What was this bad judgment of yours?” Mrs. S asked, before I had a chance to send the conversation somewhere else. “Was it a man?”</p>
<p>“What? Oh, no. Well, yes, but not like that. It was just work.”</p>
<p>I sighed. “Dog fighting. We had a tip about a house where they were keeping and training the dogs, so my department put together a team to take it out. We had the SWAT team and the regular PD with us, and they went through and cleared the scene, and then we went in to look after the dogs.” I shook my head. “It was—God, those poor animals. Wounded and chained up, crammed into tiny cages, just terrible. They had a few smaller dogs there they used for training, like little punching bags, torn up all over. So terrified, just cowering there and whimpering every time you got close.”</p>
<p>I absently took a swig of my tea and cringed. “Anyway, I was going through, tallying up the animals and taking pictures for evidence, when I hear something moving behind one of the crates. And, like an idiot, I go to see what it is, thinking it must be another dog or something.”</p>
<p>“And it wasn’t?”</p>
<p>“Nope. Perp with a nine millimeter handgun. He got off a few shots on me and tried to make a break for it, until a couple of the SWAT guys convinced him otherwise.”</p>
<p>“Oh dear. But you were all right? Except for your arm?”</p>
<p>“That, and a bruise from where he hit the vest. But yeah, I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s good. And the dogs?”</p>
<p>“They all had to be put down. Once a dog’s been trained to fight,” I shook my head. “There’s just no hope for them.”</p>
<p>Mrs. S looked aghast. “That’s terrible. But at least you got the people who were doing it.”</p>
<p>“Yes and no. I mean, we got these guys, and they’ll probably do some time. But there’s a lot of money in dog fighting, and the people who run it stay well out of our way. I doubt we’ll ever be able to bring them down. Not without a lot more people and money than we’re ever going to get, anyway.”</p>
<p>“I see.” Mrs. S looked thoughtful for a minute or so, during which Heisenberg streaked around the room a couple of times, then vanished.</p>
<p>“Excuse me for a moment,” Mrs. S said and got up and left the room, deftly picking up a tabby that was playing with the toaster as she passed.</p>
<p>While I waited, my eyes wandered to the living room, where several cats appeared to be practicing the cha cha.</p>
<p>The wonderful thing about this place, I decided, was that there was so much strangeness competing for your attention, that your brain had no choice but to just give up and go with it. It was, in an odd way, relaxing.</p>
<p>Mrs. S came back in with a large tapestry bag (I barely had to look to know it was decorated with cats) over her arm.</p>
<p>“All right,” she said. “I think I have them.”</p>
<p>She stopped and considered me for a moment.</p>
<p>“I think you should come along. It will do you good.”</p>
<p>“Come where?” I asked, but we were already there.</p>
<p>It was an oversized suburban house, the kind they made in blocks of five hundred and sold as the ultimate in luxury living. The living room was full of overstuffed leather furniture and several men (also overstuffed and covered in leather). I blanched when I saw them, or more specifically, when I saw the guns they had casually and imprudently stuck in their pants, but none of the men seemed to have noticed us.</p>
<p>I watched, transfixed, as Mrs. S walked unobserved around the room, locking every door and window (even some I could have sworn hadn’t had locks a moment before). Then she came to the center of the room and took from her bag a sealed glass bottle and an apparatus with a hammer connected to a metal box. She placed the bottle on the table and set the apparatus up next to it, so that the hammer was positioned directly over the bottle. Then she reached back into her bag and took out a small amount of dull grey metal, which she set on a dish on the apparatus. Then she turned to me and smiled.</p>
<p>“How’s that?”</p>
<p>“But. . . Wait—Are they going to die?” I stared from the bottle to the men, who seemed to be flickering between their positions in the chairs and lying on the floor.</p>
<p>“Well, we can’t know for sure. I suppose we’ll find out when someone opens the door.”</p>

Schrouml;dinger's Cat Lady

I got out of the car, smoothed my shirt down over my bulletproof vest, and contemplated the cats. They contemplated me right back. I sighed. I hated these jobs.

I opened the tiny gate to the front walk (no fence, just a gate) and made my way to the door.

The door opened and I was confronted by the smallest person I had ever met.

 Rutter had wondered that himself.  By all accounts, Solin was a plum piece of real estate, the kind one of the big companies like General M or Bushink would snatch up as an asset.  Across the galaxies, theyrsquo;d grabbed small systems every chance they got.  Solin did have a native intelligent race tp be wooed, but there was a surplus of impoverished races deep in debt to the Companies.  Very few, the ones who knew to hire themselves savvy (and expensive) legal counsel, managed to keep themselves free.

 There was, Rutter figured, something out of the ordinary about Solin.  Not out of the ordinary in a valuable way, but something tricky, something slippery or scandalous, some taint the Big Three wanted to avoid.  Hersquo;d find out soon enough, he guessed.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mur kindly introduced me in the last issue of Soundproof, but for anyone who missed that, hi. I’m Escape Pod’s Assistant Editor, and I’m most publicly known for doing the feedback segments in the podcast. I also oversee our teem of slush readers and end up sending out a lot of our rejections, and of course I lay out Soundproof. And other things, as necessary.</p>
<p>So in this beginning of a new year, I’m instead going to take you back a few days to the death of the last machine on earth that could turn a roll of Kodachrome from an opaque deep red film stock into color etched rectangles of plastic. Most of us have moved onto digital, which, let’s be fair, is significantly more user friendly and easier to control. Cheaper, too.</p>
<p>But it says something about Kodachrome — the first successful color film — that it took 75 years to be phased out of production. Sure, it had dwindled in years past, and films meant for paper prints rather than to be projected got rapidly popular, and it was a finicky, and slow, film to shoot.</p>
<p>Getting it developed in the last decade or so meant sending it to one place in Kansas and always worrying that the machine would break or Kodak would stop making the developing chemistry. While it’s trivial to develop black and white film at home, and not too horrible to do most modern color films, Kodachrome’s process would confound most any man.</p>
<p>But it was pretty. Someone wrote a bit too saccharine song about it. And it picked up the light in a bit different way than everything after it.</p>
<p>So this month we’re bringing you three stories in this pixelated form: Élan Vital by K. Tempest Bradford, Dead’s End to Middleton by Natania Barron, and God of the Lower Level by Charles M. Saplak.</p>
<p>They’re quite good.</p>

<p><strong>Dead&#8217;s End to Middleton</strong><br />
By Natania Barron</p>
<p>Dust rose at the horizon in tongues of earth and wind, dancing before  the sinking sun. Bits of mica flashed now and again; almost like fairy  dust, thought Nathaniel, more than a little delirious in his saddle by  now. It had been far too hot for a breakneck race such as this.</p>
<p>But there were slobbering, chittering creatures swarming Middleton  behind him, slavering over the horses and terrorizing the families that  made up his close-knit community. Their only hope was in him. Sutherland  Ranch couldn’t be far. Old Man Sutherland would know what to do.</p>
<p>Time was wasting. His horse, Mixup, needed water, and Nathaniel  needed rest. His tongue felt cold, his lips cracked and bleeding; he’d  gone so far past dizzy that he’d come to expect the world to shift a bit  by now.</p>
<p>But, no. Maybe not that much.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/2010/12/30/ep273-deaths-end-to-middleton/">Read More&#8211;</a><br />
<span id="more-1692"></span><br />
“Don’t move.”</p>
<p>A voice. A woman.</p>
<p>It  was easy enough to comply. Nathaniel doubted he had the strength to  move, anyway; his ankle was still twisted up in the stirrup.</p>
<p>So he’d fainted at some point. If he’d had strength in his arms,  he’d have held them up, but Nathaniel wasn’t certain what the logistics  of surrender were when belly-up to the sky.</p>
<p>“He’s hurt,” said a second voice. Another woman, but high and lovely in contrast.</p>
<p>Squinting, Nathaniel made out two figures against the pink clouds:  big hats, skirts, trim waists, and very long guns. Guns pointed at him.</p>
<p>“I’m looking for… Willard Sutherland… I’m from Middleton. We’ve been…” he barely managed the words.</p>
<p>The shorter of the two women tilted her head. She got close enough  that Nathaniel could hear the flapping of her skirts in the wind. He had  a dim recollection of Charity James being dragged off down the alleyway  between the saloon and the stables, one shoe off as she struggled and  screamed; he could see up her skirt then, all the way to her bloomers.  Then… Christ. She hadn’t screamed for long.</p>
<p>“Willard Sutherland’s dead,” said the first woman. Nathaniel tried  to get a better look at her. Curly red hair, narrow eyes, a flat nose,  big boots.</p>
<p>“Then, his sons? Edwin and Edward…” Nathaniel tried.</p>
<p>“Dead, too.”</p>
<p>“Jesus, no.” Blasphemy was the least of his worries.</p>
<p>“Afraid  so,” said the soft-voiced woman. Nathaniel could see the outline of her  slippers by his head. Pretty slippers. Expensive slippers. What  slippers like that were doing out here in the middle of nowhere, he  didn’t know.</p>
<p>“Cassandra. Hush,” said the first woman, putting down her gun and taking a few heavy-footed steps toward him.</p>
<p>Cassandra  stepped away to let the other woman by, and Nathaniel shivered. He’d  found a grain of comfort in the sweetness of Cassandra’s voice, but now  that she was gone the severity of the other woman’s words were more  clear in his head. His hope was as dead as Charity James.</p>
<p>“Then you might as well let me die here,” he said, closing his eyes.</p>
<p>“The Sutherlands aren’t all dead,” said the first woman. “But you will be soon if you don’t get some water and shelter.”</p>
<p>“You need a bath. You’re covered in, well, some rather offensive smelling ichor,” Cassandra said.</p>
<p>That was about right. The creatures had a habit of exploding rather impressively when, and if, they could be killed.</p>
<p>“Then perhaps we can talk business,” she added.</p>
<p>He licked his lips. “Business? I can’t even start to explain—”</p>
<p>“Try us,” said the other woman. “You’ll be surprised.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>There  were seven girls all told. The one in boots was Elizabeth, the eldest.  Then came Jane, red-haired like Elizabeth but without the curls; after  Jane was Lydia, with narrow eyes and white-blond hair. Then Cassandra,  the prettiest—petite and brunette, and dressed far better than the rest  of her sisters. She couldn’t have been more than about sixteen, about  the same as Nathaniel. The last three were Charlotte, Mary, and Anne,  with matching brown eyes and straight black hair; Anne was freckled and  barely thirteen.</p>
<p>When Nathaniel insisted he didn’t have time for a bath, Charlotte  and Anne took his overcoat to wash, anyway; it was crusted with  bile-green fluid and stunk up the house.</p>
<p>Nathaniel fidgeted in  the chair—a plush green affair with bronze bosses about the arms and a  set of matching doilies—while Elizabeth asked him to describe the series  of events in Middleton.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to spare us the details,” said Jane.</p>
<p>“No need to candy-coat,” Elizabeth added. She still had her shotgun across her lap, as casually placed as knit-work.</p>
<p>Nathaniel  took a deep breath and started. “About two weeks ago, a meteor landed  behind the livery. Doc Brenner brought it to town hall, and everyone  fussed over it. It was glittery, almost gold, with little rounds bits  inside—well, that’s what we found out when Mrs. Vess and Mr. Kutcheon  got into a fight over it, dropping it to the ground. It spilled these  metallic gemstones, almost like tigers-eye, but red. Two dozen to the  last one.”</p>
<p>Even if they didn’t believe him, it felt good to tell someone. Anyone.</p>
<p>“Then I suppose they called in the jeweler?” Cassandra said, leaning forward.</p>
<p>Nathaniel  was struck what she said. “Yes! Exactly. He set the stones into  necklaces and pocket-watches, for auction. I can’t tell you how much was  paid, but it was rumored that the Jones family sold half their farm to  get a watch.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth narrowed her eyes. “Same as always. Who turned first?”</p>
<p>Nathaniel was shocked into silence. “How did—?”</p>
<p>“Hey, listen,” warned Elizabeth. “We’re the ones questioning you.”</p>
<p>Nathaniel  nodded and continued, “First time I noticed something odd was with Mrs.  Vess. My family, we work the General Store, and she came in wearing her  new brooch from the auction.” He swallowed, looking down at the empty  teacup. He’d sucked it down and was jittery. “Except the stone was gone.  Then I noticed, well, this hole… seeping blood. In her chest. My dad  was asking how she was, and Mrs. Vess said she’d never been better, but  the more she talked, the more blood gushed…”</p>
<p>Nathaniel’s lips trembled as he tried to get more words out. “I was  putting her order together. I looked at the hole again; seemed like  there was no way I couldn’t. And right out of it came this wriggling…”</p>
<p>“Worm,” said Anne, with a curt nod.</p>
<p>Before Nathaniel could reply, Cassandra cut in: “And how long until  Mrs. Vess started eating people?” She was was far prettier in the light  of the parlor, the oil lamp’s glow catching in her dark hair, turning  the soft waves to auburn and copper in some places.</p>
<p>Nathaniel wanted nothing more to just stare at her; but there were uglier things in the world that held his attention.</p>
<p>“A few days later, I guess,” he explained. “My father found her…later.”</p>
<p>Mrs.  Vess had been found in the back of the livery, preying on one of her  own children, young William. Though Nathaniel hadn’t seen Mrs. Vess’s  sin directly, he had imagined it many times. And once Mrs. Vess turned,  the other twenty-three gem owners went along with her. Charity Jones had  been a merciful death, in a way; he could recollect dozens that  weren’t.</p>
<p>“My father killed her… but more turned,” said Nathaniel. “And then  they got hungry. There was no knowing what they’d eat; and the more they  ate, the more whatever it is that’s got them grew inside. I can’t… I  can’t even…”</p>
<p>“Describe them,” said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Nathaniel winced, uncertain they could handle more gruesome detail.</p>
<p>“Listen,  we can help you,” said Lydia, haughtily, as if Nathaniel should be  shamed for ever thinking otherwise. “But you’ve got to tell us what they  look like, otherwise we won’t know which guns to pack.”</p>
<p>The laugh escaped him before he could prevent it, and Elizabeth sprung to her feet, her shotgun in his face.</p>
<p>“Listen,  kid. We’re Willard Sutherland’s daughters,” she said, flicking the  barrel of the gun closer to him with every syllable. “How the hell do  you think we survive out here on our own?”</p>
<p>Nathaniel sunk down into the chair. He could smell gunpowder the  barrel was so close. “I don’t know!” he said, squirming. He’d had enough  of feeling like prey. “I just—”</p>
<p>“Our father was a drunkard and  gambler. Our brothers no better,” said Elizabeth. She swept her free  hand around the parlor. “Everything you see here we got working.”</p>
<p>“Working doing what?” he asked.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had a triumphant look on her face, as if she couldn’t wait to spoil the surprise.</p>
<p>“Killing,”  said Cassandra, cheerfully as spring rain. “It’s the family business,  you could say. It’s the only useful thing our father left us.”</p>
<p>“But—but you’re—” Nathaniel stammered.</p>
<p>“Trained as well as  our brothers were, and have spent the years since learning to augment  and improve our weapons to optimal performance and, we should add, to  significant advantage over most current available models,” chimed in  Jane. “So, if you want us to take care of this pest problem, the more  details the better.”</p>
<p>Nathaniel hugged his arms around his body, leaning back into the  chair. Sweat dripped into his eyes, and he blinked furiously, feeling  clammy all over. “By the time I left Middleton, whatever was left of the  people who’d had the stones was just skin. The things that grew inside  were like crabs with three legs—but brown and black and hairy, flecked  with red sometimes. Bits of the peoples’ clothes stayed on the  creatures’ long legs and backs, but most of peoples’ heads got busted  clean through, their skin hanging off like dried chicken skin on the  tines of a fork.”</p>
<p>“Coaters,” said Elizabeth. She was stroking the barrel of her gun  thoughtfully, having removed it from Nathaniel’s face once he began  speaking again.</p>
<p>“Coaters?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Sure,” said Lydia. “But we’ve got to figure out if they’re the smelly coaters or the quick ones.”</p>
<p>“They were fast,” whispered Nathaniel, and for the first time since  speaking to the girls, he started tearing up. He would have done  anything to spare himself the humiliation of crying in front of them, so  he bit the inside of his cheek and looked away.</p>
<p>It was Mary who asked: “Quick like a horse or quick like a train?”</p>
<p>He cleared his throat, thick with emotion. “Quick like the Devil.”</p>
<p>“That’s gotta be the quick coaters,” said Lydia.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t do anything against them…” he said, sniffling.</p>
<p>“You escaped,” said Cassandra, sweetly. She was not far from him and  she handed him one of her handkerchiefs, embroidered delicately with  interlacing strawberries. He refused and used his shirt.</p>
<p>He’d gone through Hell to get to the ranch. But what did that make the Sutherland girls?</p>
<p>“Well, if no one’s opposed, I say we do it like we did at Dead’s  End,” said Elizabeth at last, addressing her sisters. “We’ll take the  Tank and the Riser. First light.”</p>
<p>“But if we wait—” Nathaniel countered, putting the handkerchief down beside him.</p>
<p>“If we traipse into town with guns blazing in the middle of the  night, chances are we’ll get licked pretty well. I don’t know about you,  but I’m nowhere near as accurate in the dark.”</p>
<p>“But the rest of the people in town—what about them?” he asked.</p>
<p>Elizabeth shrugged. “We’ll just have to hope they don’t get turned  into dinner before we reach them. Meanwhile, you can sleep in the barn.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Lydia  and Cassandra brought him to the barn. Opening the doors wide he saw  the wonders concealed: piled to the ceiling, crammed one on top of  another, were carriages and tractors and other mechanized creations he  had no understanding of, nor words to put to. Some had sails, some had  wings; there were pipes and windows, finials and fans. What couldn’t be  seen outright was covered in tarpaulin or closed in cases, bits of metal  and leather peering out from the corners of tables and hung from above.  From the ceiling brass-lined globes creaked, swaying.</p>
<p>And all along one side of the barn was a long bar lined with shelves  and pegboard upon which hung thousands of gun, parts, and ammunition.</p>
<p>“A sight, isn’t it?” said Lydia proudly. “The Riser’s baskets are pretty comfortable if you’re looking for a place to curl up..”</p>
<p>“Riser?” asked Nathaniel.</p>
<p>“Dirigibles,” Cassandra chimed,  pointing. Nathaniel thought he could make out wicker latticework in the  distance, between a skewed grandfather clock and something that might  have been a canon.</p>
<p>“We’ll be back to get you in a few hours,” Cassandra said, turning  over her shoulder and giving him a smile bright enough to light the way  to dreaming.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Time to get going, kid.” It was Elizabeth, carrying a lantern. Morning, but still dark.</p>
<p>With a yawn, Nathaniel rose and followed Elizabeth back toward the front of the barn.</p>
<p>“That  gun you came in with isn’t going to do much,” Elizabeth said, clicking  her tongue and taking a few spry steps toward the wall of gun parts. She  ran her finger over her bottom lip, back and forth, considering. “But  I’m not sure you can handle some of our weaponry.”</p>
<p>“I can shoot,” he asserted.</p>
<p>Elizabeth narrowed her eyes at Nathaniel, looking him up and down. “You got good aim, relatively speaking?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, sure.”</p>
<p>She  unlocked a narrow oak cabinet, putting the lantern down on the table  beside her and she pulled out a long, gold-barreled weapon; the end of  it was swollen, nearly three times as wide the rest.</p>
<p>Elizabeth checked the sights, moved it side-to-side, and then went  to another cabinet, extracting a tooled leather artillery belt studded  with riveted brass balls rather than bullets. “It’s a grenade gun.  There’s a peg here at the bottom and you shove it in just so—” she  demonstrated, twisting the grenade down until it clicked, “—then aim.  It’s got a kick to it. So keep steady.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth turned quickly, leveling him with a stare;  her eyes were dark as the barrel of her shotgun. “Listen, kid. We’ve  dealt with coaters before, but if I think the situation is bad, I’m  pulling out. You get me?”</p>
<p>“If it’s about payment—”</p>
<p>“Oh, there’s lots of ways we can get payment. But we’ll deal with that later. Just making sure we’re clear.”</p>
<p>“If you help save Middleton,” Nathaniel said, “there’s nothing I wouldn’t do to help you all. I’d be indebted.”</p>
<p>“That’s what they all say,” Elizabeth said. Before he could ask her  to elucidate further, she clapped Nathaniel on the shoulder and ushered  him out of the barn.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The main carriage the Sutherlands  drove was a black and red terror of metal and gears, pulled by black  draft horses. It was fashioned from iron or hide, riveted and fastened  with brass straps, and bosses. An ornate golden S was painted on the  sides like an afterthought; a bit like putting a garland on a gun,  Nathaniel mused.</p>
<p>The other vehicle was more cart than carriage, fastened behind one  draft horse. It seated two and, Lydia breathlessly explained, was  transportation for the Riser. It would be the first sent into battle,  with the three youngest girls aboard, about a mile before they reached  Middleton.</p>
<p>All of the girls had changed into men’s attire: long brown dusters,  high-leather boots, trousers. They didn’t all match, necessarily, and  Cassandra had a pink scarf tied around her neck, but from a distance  they’d look like nothing more than a bunch of rabble-rousers out for a  morning ride, braids tucked in, corsets forgotten.</p>
<p>“The plan’s simple,” said Elizabeth, checking her own horse. “Anne,  Mary, and Charlotte are going to do a pass over, first. They’ll relay  the situation via flares. From their vantage point they should be able  to pick off a few of the quick coaters if they see them.</p>
<p>“Then we move the Tank in,” Jane said, as she thrust her thumb toward at the reinforced carriage.</p>
<p>Elizabeth  continued, with a nod to Nathaniel. “With the Tank inside, that’s where  you, Jane and me come in, kid. The Tank propels itself, see? We can go  in and out, if needs be.” She clicked her tongue, poking his shoulder.  “You’ll be on grenade duty. If you isolate one of the coaters, or a  couple even, do what you can to blow them to Hell. Think you can manage  that?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” he said, swallowing.</p>
<p>Cassandra grinned at him. “Don’t worry. We’ll burn them down just like we always do. Right, girls?”</p>
<p>There was a chorus of rousing assent, and the mechanized caravan began its grinding progress forward.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Middleton was well out of the way for most travelers going  to Prescott; as they approached, they passed no one. While it was never  considered booming, the town did boast a successful copper mine, the De  Soto, as well as the aerial tram system connected to the mine.</p>
<p>Jane, who was riding beside Nathaniel, and marked his gaze toward  the DeSoto. “It’s early in their maturation cycle yet. Chances are,  they’ll be getting ready to lay their eggs soon, and they’ll stay close  to town where the food is. They like to keep some folks alive for their  hatchlings.”</p>
<p>“Comforting,” Nathaniel said. He doubted his father would allow  himself to be toyed with in such a way. He’d rather take his own life.</p>
<p>“Looks like a good place to let the Riser up,” Elizabeth said, flagging the rest of the caravan down.</p>
<p>By the time the Riser was set to go, Mary, Charlotte, and Anne were  bedecked with leather helmets, goggles with dark-tinted glass, and long  black fingerless gloves. They each carried elegant guns, Civil War era  by the looks of them, fitted with a series of scopes and lenses.</p>
<p>Mary noticed him ogling her weapon and grinned. “We did Whitworth  one better,” she said. “I once got a Lepus californicus at 600 meters.”</p>
<p>“Lepus—?” Nathaniel asked.</p>
<p>“Jackrabbit,” corrected Anne.</p>
<p>With  a few more adjustments, the Riser took flight. Nathaniel watched the  balloon as it gained altitude, noting how deftly the girls managed the  various cables and controls.</p>
<p>“And there they go,” Cassandra said. “Now, we wait for their signal.”</p>
<p>She  walked back to check on the Tank and left Nathaniel alone to watch the  small vessel rise high, its shadows slipping over the pitted landscape  and over the hills toward Middleton. Lord, but she was beautiful.</p>
<p>Not ten minutes later a flare lit up the sky, bright blue, followed by three smaller yellow ones.</p>
<p>“That  means two sightings. They’re not gathered together like we hoped,”  muttered Lydia, peeking her head out from behind the Tank.</p>
<p>“Guns out, girls,” said Elizabeth. “Tread careful.” She pointed her elbow at Nathaniel. “You ready, kid?”</p>
<p>He realized he had yet to give them his name. It stalled him for a second, and then he said, “I guess.”</p>
<p>“Whatever you do, don’t get us killed,” Elizabeth offered. Then,  after swinging one leg up over her horse and settling in the saddle:  “Let’s ride.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>They didn’t get far past Pell’s House when  they spotted two coaters, big as horses. Their heads turned toward the  unlikely caravan, slavering jaws working back and forth. Nathaniel  didn’t have to be close to know those jaws would be slick with green  tendrils of saliva, each of the long protrusions ridged like a saw; he’d  seen them dripping with blood and gore, too, run around with intestines  and flecked with pieces of bone.</p>
<p>He’d seen worse, but he was frightened to see more.</p>
<p>“Cassandra, unhitch the horses and get in the Tank,” Elizabeth said. “Lydia, you, too. Then wind her up.”</p>
<p>Fear  made Nathaniel’s mouth go dry. The dark images of the last few days he  had tried so diligently to suppress in the Sutherland’s home rushed to  mind.</p>
<p>He felt a shove and Jane was staring him down. “You moving or what? The Tank’s got a lot better cover than the open.”</p>
<p>“B-But—” he stuttered.</p>
<p>“Get down off the damned horse and get behind the Tank.” That was Elizabeth.</p>
<p>The Tank whirred to life with the churning of heavy gears. The  whirring turned to grinding, then rattling. Nathaniel clung to the back,  lacing his hands around a cold metal handle.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was about  the other side for a moment and then began pulling at some of the  levers near the flanks of the Tank. Keeping her balance as it surged  forward she slid out a long panel on either side, locking it into place  with a few flicks of her fingers.</p>
<p>The Tank had built-in cover.</p>
<p>Elizabeth glanced up at Nathaniel and smiled crookedly. “Don’t get all excited yet, we’re just getting started.”</p>
<p>“When we stop,” Jane said, “you scramble with me to the roof. Liz’s got the rest. But make sure you stay up top, okay?”</p>
<p>All he could do was nod while the girls started shooting.</p>
<p>“And don’t get in her way,” Jane added.</p>
<p>The Tank lurched forward as the hill grew steeper. It wasn’t fast, but by God it was loud.</p>
<p>“Up! Up!” shouted Jane, grabbing Nathaniel up by the back of his shirt. He nearly choked as he was hauled up.</p>
<p>By the time he looked over the roof, one of the quick coaters was a  mess of green and gray, its long arms still twitching but entirely  severed from the body.</p>
<p>“I think that was Denny Hardaway—that coater—” Nathaniel said.</p>
<p>Jane pulled back on her shotgun and reloaded. The shell flipped out  and clattered to the metal roof. “If you can’t shoot, then shut up and  keep count.”</p>
<p>By now they were in the center of town, a ramshackle  crossroads that had never been much to speak of. The windows on most of  the homes were smashed in, ragged curtains escaping the frames and  trembling in the breeze. Some lace, others plain linen. There were  bloodstains on the dirt in some places, but there were no bodies.</p>
<p>The coaters ate everything.</p>
<p>The Tank shook as the remaining  quick coater threw itself at the contraption, its hard legs scrabbling  against the fortified sides, doing its best to get close to the fleshy  prizes within.</p>
<p>Elizabeth dangled from the front of the Tank, and with a whoop,  swung across. She came down hard with her boot on the coater’s  bullet-shaped head. It shrieked and snapped at her foot with its  pincers. She laughed. With her other foot—her single grip on the top  rail the only thing preventing her from falling into its merciless  jaws—she pushed down on a pedal on the side of the Tank and a set of  spines jutted out, sharpened to razor edges. But the coater sprang back  just in time.</p>
<p>Then its eyes turned to Nathaniel, a lid within a lid closing over a  shiny yellow iris. It made a chittering noise from somewhere within its  chest.</p>
<p>A burst of fire from the inside of the Tank sent the  coater back, twisting and writhing, catching far quicker than Nathaniel  would have expected. The flames were white, low burning, but made quick  progress. It smelled of burned tar and, distantly, roast pig.</p>
<p>“Lydia!” shouted Jane.</p>
<p>The Tank shuddered again, spewing a  jet of inky black liquid that covered the coater in a slick, tarry  substance. The creature’s mouth went open in a silent scream, and it  clawed at its face with its trembling pincers before tripping back and  hitting the ground. It heaved, then went still.</p>
<p>“Where’s the rest of them?” Elizabeth asked, pulling herself to the  top of the Tank. She stood to her full height, her face smudged with  soot, her eyes shaded and black with purpose. She looked toward the  DeSoto. “The mines. Gotta be. Not good.”</p>
<p>“What’s the plan?” asked Jane.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was silent. She was chewing on her bottom lip, and the other girls were watching her for cues. She gave none.</p>
<p>“You’ve  got to help me,” Nathaniel begged. With a hot stab of fear he  remembered what she’d said to him that morning: We’ve dealt with coaters  before, but if I think the situation is bad, I’m pulling out.</p>
<p>“You know why so few people hear about us?” Elizabeth asked him.</p>
<p>“Liz…” warned Cassandra, who had exited the carriage and was staring up at Nathaniel.</p>
<p>Nathaniel stood on shaky legs. He took deep breaths through his nose, and the air felt hot. He shook his head no.</p>
<p>“We’re a cleanup crew, kid. You know what happens to those people  after something like this? They leave. They don’t come back. That’s how  we get paid. No one comes back. You get me?” Elizabeth explained.</p>
<p>Something in the very center of him twisted, hope extinguished. Cassandra sighed and looked away.</p>
<p>Elizabeth’s tone softened, if only for a moment. “The chance that  there’s anyone is left up there is slim to none. Coaters kill fast. Show  him, Lydia.”</p>
<p>Their timing was better than a hook in a  three-penny play. Elizabeth gestured to Lydia as the younger Sutherland  sister held up a stick of dynamite, dusty gray and utterly impartial.</p>
<p>“But there’s people in the mines!” Nathaniel shouted.</p>
<p>“Then being blown to bits is a hell of a lot more merciful being turned into coater feed,” Jane said.</p>
<p>“Wait—look!” Cassandra cried.</p>
<p>A flare, bright green, and the Riser gained in altitude steeply over the DeSoto.</p>
<p>Cassandra had taken out one of her scopes and turned the lens toward  the mine. Nathaniel was glad of it; he had been two blinks from  sobbing. The scaffolding of the aerial tramway showed dark against the  horizon.</p>
<p>Cassandra gave Nathaniel a smile. “Green means survivors.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be,” said Elizabeth, after looking through the scope herself. “Clinging to the tram cars.”</p>
<p>Nathaniel didn’t want to look, even when Elizabeth offered. He couldn’t stand knowing who was up there.</p>
<p>“So, new plan,” Elizabeth said. “We need two groups; one to get the people, and one to deploy the explosives.”</p>
<p>“There’s a back mine-shaft,” said Nathaniel, willing his thoughts into more coherent order.</p>
<p>“Good enough. We’ll poke it full of holes,” said Lydia with a wink.</p>
<p>“I’ll go with Lydia,” said Jane.</p>
<p>“Then  it’s Cassandra and you, with me,” Elizabeth said, grinning at  Nathaniel. He wondered how in God’s name she could grin. But there it  was. Plain as rain.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Nathaniel was given a pair of pistols and was still trying  to adjust them while managing the grenade gun as they approached the  DeSoto and the tram car full of survivors.</p>
<p>Before they could get close enough, Elizabeth announced: “Look, company.”</p>
<p>The coater scuttled toward them like a crab with a missing leg,  dragging its back leg rather ineffectually, and clicking its jaws. Half  dead, but full hungry.</p>
<p>Nathaniel blew it back to Hell, aiming  just in front of it, so as it staggered toward them it met the blast  from the grenade gun. Elizabeth had been right: the kickback was  intense, sending his elbow up and nearly clocking him in the chin.</p>
<p>Bits of the quick coater rained down before them, crackling and sizzling as they struck the ground.</p>
<p>“Found your trigger finger, I see,” said Cassandra with a wink.</p>
<p>He could hear the people in the tram now, shouting, but he couldn’t make out their words. They’d been spotted.</p>
<p>But the coaters saw them, too.</p>
<p>“Cassandra, you get the ones on the left; Nathaniel, go for the straight shots, just like before,” Elizabeth said.</p>
<p>“Don’t  worry about us,” Cassandra said, lifting a long, silver-barreled  shotgun from over her shoulder. There were two brass tanks on either  side of it, with accompanying silver piping. “Just keep a good distance.  I wouldn’t want to singe off your lovely eyebrows.”</p>
<p>Nathaniel blushed, then poised for action: eight coaters now  approached, the skin and clothes on their hairy bodies stretched wide,  tanned and torn, leaving little vestige of the bodies they once  inhabited.</p>
<p>The centermost coater was skittering back and forth,  opening its mouth to call to its companions; the others took up  formation behind.</p>
<p>“Now, kid, now!” shouted Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Nathaniel squeezed the  trigger, prepared for the kick-back this time. But the grenade landed  too far to make much of a difference, decimating a boulder and taking a  good chunk out of the side of the mine. His vision obscured entirely by  the dust, he staggered back just as Cassandra started her onslaught.</p>
<p>Her gun didn’t shoot bullets. It spewed fire.</p>
<p>“To the center, kid!” shouted Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Nathaniel’s  fingers were sweaty and he aimed and shot again, this time true. The  heat of the fire from the grenade blast warmed Nathaniel’s face and when  he opened his eyes, all that remained of the two coaters were twitching  amidst the sand and rock.</p>
<p>They moved on. If Nathaniel didn’t destroy it, Cassandra incinerated it.</p>
<p>“Let’s move, kids,” Elizabeth said when it was clear, shoving past Cassandra and falling into a jog toward the swaying tram car.</p>
<p>Nathaniel  swallowed, each step closer to the tram. He caught a glimpse of a face,  remembered: Dylan Seymore, one of his classmates in Miss Pellsey’s  school… and then, Miss Pellsey, too, her long, white fingers clinging to  the edge of the tram car, her usually tidy hair spilled down her  shoulders, eyes wide. But not his father.</p>
<p>With a wide spray of flame, and a few coordinated shots from  Elizabeth, the last few coaters beneath the tram were reduced to a pile  of singed chitin.</p>
<p>Dylan was the first to speak from above. “The  tram’s jammed!” he shouted. “Saved our lives getting up here, but now we  can’t get down.”</p>
<p>“Are there any people in the mines?” asked Elizabeth, shading her  eyes as she looked up at the tram car. The one further down the line  shuddered, and a few, pale faces peered out.</p>
<p>“It’s impossible to say for sure,” said Miss Pellsey.</p>
<p>Elizabeth shot the flare up—bright red.</p>
<p>“What’s that mean?” asked Nathaniel.</p>
<p>“Lydia’s clear for—” Cassandra replied.</p>
<p>The  ground shook with the first explosion. Nathaniel fell to his knees from  the impact, and smoke billowed from a gaping hole in the side of the  mine.</p>
<p>The DeSoto was on fire.</p>
<p>Coaters streamed from the mouth of  the mine just as the Riser crested over them, Anne, Charlotte, and Mary  taking aim with their sniper guns. There were seven coaters all told,  and one far larger than the rest, striped rather than speckled, the back  part of her thorax wider and paler.</p>
<p>Nathaniel looked desperately for a hint of who the coater once was, a  strip of fabric or a familiar belt. But he saw nothing. He stood and  shouldered his gun.</p>
<p>“That’s the Queen,” said Elizabeth, through gritted teeth. “Fire won’t work. When I give you the signal—”</p>
<p>The other coaters were going down, thanks to the girls on the Riser,  but Elizabeth stopped when the unmistakable sound of twisting metal  caught her attention. Another explosion from the opposite side, and the  tramway scaffolding started to twist and move down, as if an invisible  hand had grasped it and pulled it down toward the earth.</p>
<p>Lydia came running, Jane barely on her heels.</p>
<p>“Too much heat!” shouted Lydia, her voice barely audible above the din. “Jesus, too much heat!”</p>
<p>The Queen lowered her head, angular and speckled with six black dots above her lazy eyes, and stared at him. Nathaniel froze.</p>
<p>“It’s a copper mine!” Lydia’s voice was drifting toward him, but  Nathaniel’s world was slowly losing all sense. “It’s chalcopyrite, and a  hell of a lot of it. Too much heat and it goes magnetic—it’s pulling  down the scaffolding as the fire moves!”</p>
<p>Distantly, Nathaniel was aware that the trams above them were  shaking, that the people were screaming, that the dynamite had been a  mistake.</p>
<p>The Queen charged toward Nathaniel, her wail as loud as  a steam engine. Her three legs pounded the earth as she charged, head  down, gaping maw wide.</p>
<p>Bullets plinked off of her chitinous hide, angering her but doing  little damage. Nathaniel marveled at the beauty of her, the lustre of  her scales, the perfect lines of hair down the sides of her three legs.  Beautiful death, coming at breakneck speed.</p>
<p>A shadow snapped Nathaniel out of it, then he was hit, hard, on the  back of the head as the basket of the Riser clocked him. He fell, his  arm crushing under him, going face-down into the rubble. The the  dirigible made contact with the Queen and the three youngest Sutherlands  tumbled out of the Riser like practiced acrobats.</p>
<p>The balloon punctured on contact with the Queen, helped by a series  of percussive shots, and deflated around her. She thrashed beneath,  giving the Sutherlands a moment to regroup.</p>
<p>Nathaniel was aware  that he was being dragged somewhere, but the sky was spinning. The  ground shook again, and he turned his head to the side, just as a  blossom of flame obscured all sight in brilliant orange and red.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Nathaniel.”</p>
<p>He moved. It hurt. Everything hurt.</p>
<p>“Cassandra?” he asked.</p>
<p>When he opened his eyes, his eyelids cracked. Then they burned. He remembered fire. He remembered everything.</p>
<p>“It’s Miss Pellsey,” said his schoolmistress. “You’re in the hospital, in Prescott. It’s been two weeks since… ”</p>
<p>Nathaniel tried to swallow. His tongue felt as if were coated in wool.</p>
<p>“The  papers say it was Mexicans, of course — picked the town clean, even the  bank was emptied.” Miss Pellsey didn’t sound convinced, but when his  vision cleared a bit more, he could see she was smiling.</p>
<p>“Where.. where’s Dad?” Nathaniel asked.</p>
<p>She sighed, leaning  back in the chair. “He didn’t last much longer after you left, but  you’ve got to know he was the one that helped us get to the tram. He  died protecting us, the six of us who made it, and that assures him a  place in heaven.”</p>
<p>Heaven. Nathaniel didn’t believe in heaven anymore. e.</p>
<p>“You  got the bad end of the blast that saved us,” Miss Pellsey said. “I can’t  chalk it up to anything else than sheer luck, or blessing, but our tram  car fell just right. You did well, Nathaniel.”</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, feeling his body shudder against emotion, pain throbbing in his arms and chest.</p>
<p>“When  you’re fit again,” she said, “you’ve got a job working as a clerk at  one of the stores in town. If that’s what you like. It’s better here, in  the city. I feel safer, somehow.”</p>
<p>Nathaniel turned his head away from her. She was talking to him just  to make herself feel better. He still didn’t have the heart to tell her  to shut up.</p>
<p>He felt gentle pressure on his fingers.</p>
<p>“Ring  the nurse if you need. I’m staying nearby; just send word, and I’ll be  by,” she said and left, closing the door gently behind her.</p>
<p>The light from the window was bright, perfectly golden yellow. It  fell on the enamel table beside him and revealed nothing. No notes, no  flowers. Just imperfections and scratches, the sign of use, of wear.</p>
<p>Then, as he shifted in the bed, he felt something soft in his hand that he  hadn’t noticed before; he looked down. A handkerchief, embroidered with  interlaced strawberries.</p>
<p>Hope had wings.</p>

Dead's End to Middleton
By Natania Barron

Dust rose at the horizon in tongues of earth and wind, dancing before  the sinking sun. Bits of mica flashed now and again; almost like fairy  dust, thought Nathaniel, more than a little delirious in his saddle by  now. It had been far too hot for a breakneck race such as this.

But there were slobbering, chittering creatures swarming Middleton  behind him, slavering over the horses and terrorizing the families that  made up his close-knit community. Their only hope was in him. Sutherland  Ranch couldnrsquo;t be far. Old Man Sutherland would know what to do.

Time was wasting. His horse, Mixup, needed water, and Nathaniel  needed rest. His tongue felt cold, his lips cracked and bleeding; hersquo;d  gone so far past dizzy that hersquo;d come to expect the world to shift a bit  by now.

But, no. Maybe not that much.

Read More--

ldquo;Donrsquo;t move.rdquo;

A voice. A woman.

It  was easy enough to comply. Nathaniel doubted he had the strength to  move, anyway; his ankle was still twisted up in the stirrup.

So hersquo;d fainted at some point. If hersquo;d had strength in his arms,  hersquo;d have held them up, but Nathaniel wasnrsquo;t certain what the logistics  of surrender were when belly-up to the sky.

ldquo;Hersquo;s hurt,rdquo; said a second voice. Another woman, but high and lovely in contrast.

Squinting, Nathaniel made out two figures against the pink clouds:  big hats, skirts, trim waists, and very long guns. Guns pointed at him.

ldquo;Irsquo;m looking forhellip; Willard Sutherlandhellip; Irsquo;m from Middleton. Wersquo;ve beenhellip;rdquo; he barely managed the words.

The shorter of the two women tilted her head. She got close enough  that Nathaniel could hear the flapping of her skirts in the wind. He had  a dim recollection of Charity James being dragged off down the alleyway  between the saloon and the stables, one shoe off as she struggled and  screamed; he could see up her skirt then, all the way to her bloomers.  Thenhellip; Christ. She hadnrsquo;t screamed for long.

ldquo;Willard Sutherlandrsquo;s dead,rdquo; said the first woman. Nathaniel tried  to get a better look at her. Curly red hair, narrow eyes, a flat nose,  big boots.

ldquo;Then, his sons? Edwin and Edwardhellip;rdquo; Nathaniel tried.

ldquo;Dead, too.rdquo;

ldquo;Jesus, no.rdquo; Blasphemy was the least of his worries.

ldquo;Afraid  so,rdquo; said the soft-voiced woman. Nathaniel could see the outline of her  slippers by his head. Pretty slippers. Expensive slippers. What  slippers like that were doing out here in the middle of nowhere, he  didnrsquo;t know.

ldquo;Cassandra. Hush,rdquo; said the first woman, putting down her gun and taking a few heavy-footed steps toward him.

Cassandra  stepped away to let the other woman by, and Nathaniel shivered. Hersquo;d  found a grain of comfort in the sweetness of Cassandrarsquo;s voice, but now  that she was gone the severity of the other womanrsquo;s words were more  clear in his head. His hope was as dead as Charity James.

ldquo;Then you might as well let me die here,rdquo; he said, closing his eyes.

ldquo;The Sutherlands arenrsquo;t all dead,rdquo; said the first woman. ldquo;But you will be soon if you donrsquo;t get some water and shelter.rdquo;

ldquo;You need a bath. Yoursquo;re covered in, well, some rather offensive smelling ichor,rdquo; Cassandra said.

That was about right. The creatures had a habit of exploding rather impressively when, and if, they could be killed.

ldquo;Then perhaps we can talk business,rdquo; she added.

He licked his lips. ldquo...</itunes:summary>

		<description><![CDATA[Most of us have heard the term "gold farmer", and we know it means "someone who plays games to get gold and rare items, then sell them". But who are the gold farmers? In <i>For the Win</i>, we find that they're just like us. Or, maybe, just like our kids.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t play MMORPGs. I never have. They&#8217;re just too big for me. If I&#8217;m going to play a RPG, it&#8217;s going to be something I can play by myself, with lots of cut-scenes and a hint book &#8212; because, in my opinion, the best part about RPGs isn&#8217;t figuring out that you need to combine the Widget of Destiny with the Wilted Flower to create a Magical Key of Awesomeness. It&#8217;s playing the game like an interactive movie with battle sequences.</p>
<p>Which is why I love Final Fantasy VII and X so very much.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/ea_ftw.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1646" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 3px;" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/ea_ftw.jpg" alt="" width="128" height="195" /></a>But that doesn&#8217;t mean I didn&#8217;t also thoroughly enjoy Cory Doctorow&#8217;s latest novel, <em>For the Win</em>.</p>
<p><em>For the Win</em>, ostensibly a YA novel (I&#8217;d say &#8220;mature YA&#8221;), contains some pretty heavy concepts, most of them dealing with economics, gaming, labor, employee rights, and the way totalitarian governments deal with lawbreakers. But fortunately, that&#8217;s not all it&#8217;s about.</p>
<p><em>For the Win</em> follows a few major characters and spans the entire near-future Earth (much in the same way that Doctorow&#8217;s <em>Little Brother</em> was just around the corner in terms of its timeline). In California, Leonard Goldberg dreams of going to China to meet his guildmates in Svart&#8230; Svartal&#8230; Some-Long-Viking-Word Warriors. In Atlanta, Connor Prikkel works to protect Coca-Cola&#8217;s games division from people who game the system. In India, Mala forms an army to take on gold farmers at the behest of the games companies themselves. In China, Matthew Fong uses his savant-like strategies to get the best stuff from games. Also in China, we have Jiandi, a radio host very popular with the downtrodden factory girls &#8212; the young women who make a huge amount of stuff Westerners take for granted. And then, I believe in Indonesia or Malaysia, we find the trio of Big Sister Nor, Justbob, and The Mighty Krang, who just want gold farmers to have the same rights as everyone else.</p>
<p>Far more complicated than <em>Little Brother</em>, <em>For the Win</em> requires readers to keep all these characters and their motivations straight in their heads, while also keeping track of the different game worlds in which they all play. S-Word Warriors, Mushroom Kingdom, and Zombie Mecha are the three main ones, but Doctorow also gives us glimpses into others, such as Magic of Hogwarts, which I for one would really like to play. But like <em>Little Brother</em>, <em>For the Win</em> educates as well as entertains. Most gamers have at least heard of gold farmers, of boys and young men in China playing games to make money and get big items that can be sold to people who don&#8217;t have eight hours a day, every day, to level their characters up. What <em>For the Win</em> does is reminds us that these gold farmers, while they do get to play games all day, are still doing work, and if they&#8217;re in one of the many countries where workers don&#8217;t have rights&#8230; well, things can get ugly. Especially if they demand what even the most slacker teen working at Taco Bell has here in the U.S. (and much of the West).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big concept, and not something that every YA reader will be able to wrap his or her head around. Doctorow does a great job of breaking down the economics and the labor issues into understandable chunks, but I don&#8217;t think a tenth-grade teacher could give this book to an average English class and expect all the students to grasp everything as well as, say, a college freshman or early-30s writer could do. Not the author&#8217;s fault; like I said, these are big concepts, much bigger than <em>Little Brother</em>&#8216;s relatively-simple &#8220;freedom to do what we want, without being spied upon, so long as we&#8217;re not harming anyone&#8221; message.</p>
<p>This book is also pretty violent. Kids are hurt, and even killed; there&#8217;s one scene where a murder takes you completely by surprise because you&#8217;re expecting something different to happen. The police beat and jail young teens and adults alike. There&#8217;s riots, narrow escapes, unjust imprisonments, and a disproportionate number of kicks or punches to the groin area &#8212; for a book as short as <em>For the Win</em>, I really did notice it. I guess that&#8217;s intentional &#8212; not every YA reader has been beaten up by the police, but I&#8217;m going to bet that most boys, by the age of 18, have taken at least one shot to the nads and can therefore identify with the pain the characters are going through.</p>
<p>I realize now that this review has been fairly dark so far, which isn&#8217;t fair to the tone of the book &#8212; Doctorow&#8217;s writing is quick and witty, full of contemporary phrases that the intended audience will totally grok. And there&#8217;s lots of hopeful moments, such as when Leonard realizes his dream only to find out that what his parents were putting him through was nothing compared to the lives his friends in China have to deal with, and then watching him rise to the occasion. Plus the irrepressible good humor of Jiandi, Ashok&#8217;s insistence that everything is going to be all right if only people listen to him, and of course the ending. I can&#8217;t tell you much about it, because it would be spoiler-y, but if you&#8217;ve ever read a YA novel where kids are the heroes and adults are the villains, you&#8217;ve probably got a pretty good idea what happens.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed <em>For the Win</em>, and I enjoyed it even more because <a href="http://craphound.com/ftw">Doctorow makes all his books available for free on his website</a>. I read this as a PDF on my iPad &#8212; the first electronic book I&#8217;ve read for pleasure<a href="#jr_adamsmith">*</a> &#8212; and if you have a device that can read PDFs, you can just download it. But that&#8217;s not to say there&#8217;s anything wrong with picking it up in the store. I&#8217;m fairly certain that most people have done so (or at least bought a Kindle/Nook version).</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t recommend this book to someone just picking up Doctorow for the first time (although it is pretty accessible). However, if there&#8217;s a gamer in your life that you want to start reading books instead of killing orcs, this is definitely one to buy. Technically-minded people will also appreciate the level of detail and research in the novel, and genre readers will see all of this happening just around the corner.</p>
<p><em>For the Win</em>. Full of win.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a science fiction writer, one of my hobbies is comparative anatomy. It is important for me to know how various organisms on Earth have solved the problems of moving, eating, seeing, and so on in order to build plausible aliens (or modifications for human beings). Evolution is constantly throwing things at the wall to see what sticks, and that churn produces some really interesting solutions to mundane-seeming problems.</p>
<p>Take walking, for example. Most of our familiar walking creatures (except bugs) are based on the tetrapod body plan. Four limbs, two on a pelvis and two up near a head. As evolutionary pressures drive a species to be bigger and bigger, their limbs become more robust to support the extra weight. Evolution is not an intelligent process, and so every solution is quick and dirty, thrown together from preexisting parts and driven as much by chance as by natural selection. Thus, animals with superficially similar body plans may, on closer examination, have wildly different anatomies.</p>
<p>Everyone&#8217;s favorite cuddly megafauna, the elephant, walks on its toes. Its weight is carried on an enormous shock absorber made of fat and connective tissue that sits behind its toes. This system works so well for the elephant that they can move almost silently. From a human point of view, elephant feet look right. They bend in the right places, and the idea of walking along on one&#8217;s splayed fingertips isn&#8217;t too alien.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to assume that elephantine dinosaurs had feet like elephants, especially when they are so often illustrated that way. The first clue that this isn&#8217;t the case is in the tracks: some sauropods leave crescent-shaped tracks. Next, there&#8217;s the skeleton. Except for the thumb, the toes of Eusauropoda are blunt, clawless nubs. These multi-ton dinosaurs walked on the ends of their metacarpal bones &#8212; the bones which, in humans, form the back of the hand.</p>
<p>How strange this must have looked! As a writer, imagining the motion of such an animal and then translating that movement onto the page is a glorious challenge. I can look at reconstructions, or I can press my hands into odd shapes and imagine what it would be like to walk on a column of hand-bones. Where the animal&#8217;s wrist would be, and how it would bend&#8230; All the things I must keep in mind if I write such a creature into a story.</p>
<p>For more detailed information and pictures, see the <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2008/10/the_hands_of_sauropods.php">Tetrapod Zoologist</a>. I highly recommend that blog as a resource for cool animal facts and analysis.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every now and then, a sci-fi or fantasy novel or series comes along that completely redefines your definition of &#8220;the best sci-fi book I&#8217;ve read&#8221;. Which is not to say it&#8217;s the best book ever, or that everyone who reads it will love it.</p>
<p>However, in the case of author Sean McMullen&#8217;s <em>Souls in the Great Machine</em>, I feel comfortable saying &#8220;you&#8217;re going to like this book&#8221;.</p>
<p>SOTM, released in 1999 as a single-book version of McMullen&#8217;s <em>Voices in the Light</em> (1994) and <em>Mirrorsun Rising</em> (1995), takes place in Australia, in the future, after a worldwide event called Greatwinter led to the end of modern technology as we know it. No cars, only trains &#8212; many powered by wind or by passengers doing the pedaling. No phones, only beamflash &#8212; long-distance semaphore similar to <a href="http://wiki.lspace.org/wiki/Clacks">the Clacks</a>. And no computers.</p>
<p>Until a young woman named Zarvora Cybeline decides to build a computer.</p>
<p>The thing is, she can&#8217;t do it with electronic machines, because the Wanderers &#8212; satellites left in orbit from the technological age &#8212; will blow electronic and fuel-powered machines out of existence the moment they sense them.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s a girl to do? Well, if you&#8217;re Zarvora, you take over the most powerful entity in Australia &#8212; Libris, the library system &#8212; and conscript criminals and numerate individuals to sit in a huge room and do calculations for you. Occasionally you&#8217;ll have to duel someone &#8212; with flintlock firearms &#8212; or take over the government, but when you want to prevent the end of the world (again), sometimes a girl&#8217;s got to get her hands dirty.</p>
<p>Into this world, we bring a cast of characters that you&#8217;ll enjoy the hell out of, including such rogues as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lemorel: an extremely intelligent librarian who you should never, ever wrong. Because she&#8217;ll kill you.</li>
<li>Glasken: a chemistry student with a taste for fine wine and fine women. Guess who he ends up with.</li>
<li>Theresla: an abbess from a far-off region who, it&#8217;s said, eats grilled mice on toast. When she can find toast.</li>
<li>Ilyire: a driven, dangerous man who you&#8217;d be glad to have at your back. Just make sure he&#8217;s on your side first.</li>
<li>Dolorian: a beautiful junior librarian who knows exactly how many buttons of her blouse should be undone at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>These characters, and all the other inhabitants of Australia, are subject to a strange force &#8212; the Call &#8212; which sweeps across the land, forcing those caught unawares to walk south, to some unimaginable fate. No one knows where the Call comes from, and only a few can predict it, and no one can resist it. Precautions are taken &#8212; belt anchors, mercy walls, and the like &#8212; but if you&#8217;re caught, you&#8217;re gone.</p>
<p>Lest you think nothing actually <em>happens</em> in the book, I assure you there&#8217;s murder, mischief, sex, love, war, technology, and a whole lot of humor. In fact, McMullen is one of the most consistently humorous writers I&#8217;ve encountered who isn&#8217;t specifically writing a humorous tale.</p>
<p>The book itself is massive &#8212; a small-print mass-market paperback version is almost 600 pages &#8212; but into those pages you&#8217;ll find a world unlike many others, a world of intelligence and honor, chivalry and technology, science and religion, and much, much more. Oh, and for some reason, lots of talk about breasts &#8212; I&#8217;m going to be honest here: one thing McMullen does in both the Greatwinter and Moonworlds sagas is show his characters&#8217; appreciation for that part of the female anatomy. It&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s a Hooters in Rochester (the Australian city around which much of this book takes place), but trust me. You&#8217;ll notice it.</p>
<p>And if you really like the book, don&#8217;t fret &#8212; there&#8217;s volumes two and three, <em>The Miocene Arrow</em> and <em>Eyes of the Calculor</em>. I personally think <em>Souls</em> is the best of them, and it does stand alone; you don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to read the other two.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to tell you everything about my favorite scenes &#8212; Denkar meeting Black Alpha&#8217;s true face, learning about resistance to the Call and how exactly that works, Glasken&#8217;s time with Theresla as well as his escape from the most dangerous fighting monks in the land, and the final duel between the villain and&#8230; well, I can&#8217;t tell you that. I don&#8217;t want to spoil the book for you &#8212; especially when, as I said, this is the book that, to me, redefined my personal definition of &#8220;best&#8221; when it comes to SF novels. It has everything I like &#8212; full characters, a sweeping story, great worldbuilding, and enough action to keep me interested without taking away from the science and technology<a href="#jr_boobs">*</a>.</p>
<p>Buy this book. Read it. It&#8217;s worth it. Trust me.</p>
<p><a name="jr_boobs">*</a> <em>And breasts. Hey, I&#8217;m a lech, but at least I&#8217;m a charming one. Right? Anyone?</em></p>

<p>We also had two new online publications provided us with fiction in November:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://scienceinmyfiction.com/2010/11/29/fiction-buckets-of-light-by-dylan-fox/">Buckets of Light</a> by Dylan Fox in Science in My Fiction and <a href="http://giganotosaurus.org/2010/11/01/the-bleeding-and-the-bloodless">The Bleeding and the Bloodless</a> by Ruth Nestvold in Giganotosaurus (12,000 words!)</li>
<li>In November there were also several stories available at both <a href="http://expandedhorizons.net/magazine/?page_id=1981">Expanded Horizons</a> and at <a href="http://dailysciencefiction.com/recent">Daily Science Fiction.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The online fiction community has always been active and it is great to see authors being remunerated for their efforts at an increasing number of online venues.  We can help support this trend by dropping by these online magazines and reading their excellent stories.  These stories are free, like the heat from the distant stars that warm all those habitable planets that are out there, waiting for us.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.nightshadebooks.com/cart.php?m=product_detail&amp;p=168"><img class="alignright" style="margin: 3px; border: 0pt none;" title="Habitation of the Blessed" src="https://www.nightshadebooks.com/secure/images/products/168_large.jpg" alt="" width="163" height="250" /></a><em>The Habitation of the Blessed</em>, being the first volume of A Dirge for Prester John, is the newest addition to the long and honorable tradition of fan fiction dedicated to a 12th-century forgery. The original letter described a kingdom in the generically exotic and conveniently distant &#8220;east,&#8221; where a Christian priest ruled a nation of improbable creatures, and oh-by-the-way also the Fountain of Youth. The letter went viral, spawning argument, analysis, fan fiction, and ill-fated military expeditions whose commanders though Prester John would show up with his griffins and his lions to help with the Crusades. It stayed popular for the next five hundred years, until Europeans got far enough east to realize that Prester John had never existed.</p>
<p>More information about the historical Letter of Prester John can be found at the handy <a href="http://presterjohnonline.com/">Prester John</a> website.</p>
<p>Catherynne Valente&#8217;s book takes on the myth from a science fiction point of view, asking the practical questions of &#8212; How did a random Christian guy end up king of all these incredible people? How does a society made of so many radically different people, from the talking griffons to the headless Blemmyes, actually work? And what is life like for people who drink from the Fountain of Youth?</p>
<p>The world she builds on this foundation is like nothing I have seen before. If I had to, I suppose I could compare it to the way I remember Narnia, before someone pointed out all the Christian symbolism and I grew old enough to wonder where the tea and sugar came from. Catherynne Valente does a remarkable thing in a book with one foot in a medieval bestiary: Not one of her characters is a symbol. Each of them, even the ones we only meet briefly, feels as real as any of the people I see every day. At one point our heroes meet a man who is digging endless tunnels through the mixture of air and sea that has smothered his city. He has the head of a goat, and his circumstances are strange even by local standards, but in a crisis he puts his head down and gets to work, trusting everyone else to do the same.</p>
<p>The superbly-drawn characters make the framing narrative and structure easy to follow. The Habitation of the Blessed has at least four major narrative tracks &#8212; the story of Hagia, fierce and beautiful, who forces Prester John to see her as a person and not just as an upsetting body, the story of Imtithal and the queen&#8217;s children, Prester John&#8217;s own story, and the story of the monks who followed him.</p>
<p>Prester John himself has the potential to be just another Christian man who arrives in a foreign country, fails to understand or even acknowledge the beliefs of the locals, and decides that God wants him to be in charge (why they never seem to use the premises that 1-their God is supposed to be omnipotent and 2-the locals are getting along fine to deduce that 3-God is ok with the status quo&#8230; is a topic for another time.) Like the rest of the characters, though, he isn&#8217;t a just symbol or a message, and it&#8217;s hard not to feel for him as he tries to make sense of the bizarre world in which he finds himself, as the people he meets challenge and overturn his most deeply held beliefs, just by existing.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t want to put The Habitation of the Blessed down and read something else, but I ran out of pages. It comes to a conclusion of sorts, though there is clearly more story left to tell. My only consolation is the promise of a sequel.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Why was Captain Archer's Enterprise so much cooler-looking on the inside than Captain Kirk's? Why did Robert Heinlein say we'd store computer data on tape spools? Why did Londo's quarters have a pillow that looked like a reject from the Bill Cosby Sweater Outlet?]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the <em>Star Trek</em> novel <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Doctor%27s_Orders">Doctor&#8217;s Orders</a> &#8212; which you really ought to read if you like Trek &#8212; there&#8217;s an offhanded remark made about how an additional 80 <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/How-Much-is-a-Terabyte">terabytes</a> of data storage were added to the <em>Enterprise</em> computers in advance of their science mission to 1212 Muscae V.</p>
<p>I first read this novel in 1990, when it was released &#8212; I&#8217;d been reading adult-targeted SF (mostly Trek novels) since 1987<a href="#jr_bookstop">*</a>, but it wasn&#8217;t until I reread DO earlier this year (for about the 25th time) that I noticed there&#8217;s five percent of that <em>in my living room alone</em>.</p>
<p>The whole point of futuristic sci-fi is to look ahead, extrapolate what might happen, and write stories about it. Well, Diane Duane either extrapolated hard drive space based upon what she had in her personal computer<a href="#jr_mycompy">***</a> and how much space it took to store various files or &#8212; more likely &#8212; did some research on computing and extended it to the future.</p>
<p>By the time I was selling computers, in 1995, 40GB was <em>de rigeur</em> (<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=iirc">IIRC</a>). This little factoid tells you just how far we came in the five years after the book was published.</p>
<p><a href="http://bestgamewallpapers.com/perimeter/futuristic-city"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1589" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/eablog_futuristiccity_120910-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="350" /></a></p>
<p>If you really want to see how fast the speed of sci-fi moves, read some Robert Heinlein novels. It seems to me like, in each decade, Heinlein readjusted his expectations of where we would be in 30, 40, or 50 years. In <em>Stranger in a Strange Land</em>, which to the best of my knowledge takes place in the late 20th century but was written in 1961, Jubal Harshaw stores data on reels of tape. By the late 20th century, I was using disks, although we still sold tapes in the store. Contrast that to <em>Friday</em>, written 21 years later and occurring in the mid 21st century &#8212; data and other material can be stored in tiny cases of sorts, such as the one Friday has implanted behind her navel. Well, on my desk right now I have two sticks of data no bigger than my index finger, each of which hold 16 gigabytes &#8212; <em>eight hundred times</em> more storage than on my first computer&#8217;s hard drive, and it&#8217;s only been 20 years.</p>
<p>As a writer of science fiction, I often find it difficult to predict exactly what&#8217;s going to change, and when. In 2004, I had a <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/smartphones/motorola-v600-at-t/4505-6452_7-30734088.html">Motorola v600</a> which was, at the time, a pretty awesome cellphone. Also in 2004, I started writing a novel in which everyone carried an ID card that you could &#8220;run&#8221; through a &#8220;comp&#8221;. The ID contained your credit information, your rank and position (if you were in the military), and various other data. The book takes place in the 2900s, and the technology is not human-based (for reasons I won&#8217;t get into), so I suppose I can get away with it for that reason, but by the time we hit&#8230; oh, I don&#8217;t know, 2025&#8230; the concept of needing a physical card will probably have gone the way of the dinosaur, in favor of keeping everything on your cell phone or implanted in a chip under your skin.</p>
<p>The point of that paragraph is this: by the time I had written the first 10,000 words of that (as yet unpublished &#8212; and incomplete) novel, <em>the technology was already dated</em>. Imagine how authors feel when they finish a book, get it edited, get it on the publication schedule&#8230; and then, two months before it&#8217;s released, something new is invented that makes the book obsolete.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the speed of sci-fi.</p>
<p>Oh, there are more glaring examples &#8212; 45 years ago, we thought the <em>Enterprise</em> bridge was totally futuristic, but when the show <em>Enterprise</em> came out, somehow there was more technology on Archer&#8217;s bridge than on Kirk&#8217;s. Somehow, communicators and tricorders &#8212; and the engine room &#8212; looked way cooler in 2151 than 2266. I know, I know, we can make cooler-looking stuff now, so why don&#8217;t we, right? But even then, Archer and T&#8217;Pol didn&#8217;t have anything like an iPhone, and the closest thing Kirk got to an iPad was that electronic slate thingy Yeoman Rand brought him every episode.</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t even get me started on <em>Babylon 5</em>. If you thought the speed of sci-fi was fast, you haven&#8217;t lived until you&#8217;ve seen the crazy throw pillows and patterns on that show. Londo has a pillow in the first season<a href="#jr_b5">****</a> that looks like it was made from one of Bill Cosby&#8217;s more cubist <a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=cosby+sweater&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=univ&amp;ei=Eg4BTa6oE8T48Abjr8XLBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGwQsAQwCQ&amp;biw=1302&amp;bih=996">sweaters</a>.</p>
<p>I think this is why so many authors are writing sci-fi after some sort of watershed event &#8212; the earth being flooded or the oceans drying up, a nuclear holocaust or other extinction-level event &#8212; and why they&#8217;ve always done so. If there&#8217;s a fundamental shift in the world itself, technology doesn&#8217;t matter so much. Sure, in the 2100s, humanity had space technology (according to Sean McMullen&#8217;s amazing <em>Souls in the Great Machine</em>, which I&#8217;ll be reviewing soon), but after Greatwinter, all sorts of old-technology-that-is-new-again was developed because we didn&#8217;t <em>have</em> spaceships and laser guns and computers anymore. It provides a clean slate.</p>
<p>Compare that to <a href="http://bigpulp.com/content/humor/roseman_section3a.html">Section 3A</a>, a recent story of mine in which everyone has a lawyer. According to a lawyer friend of mine, that could be coming sooner than we think.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll end this article by appropriating a page from <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/alasdairstuart">Alasdair Stuart</a>&#8216;s playbook and slightly modify a well-known quote: sci-fi moves pretty fast. If you don&#8217;t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.</p>
<p><a name="jr_bookstop">*</a> <em>In 1987, my mom picked me up from summer camp and told me and my sister that my dad had seriously injured his foot, and we were going to see him at the hospital. On the way, we stopped at <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/1997/11/17/newscolumn5.html">Bookstop</a><a href="#jr_compstore">**</a> because, as my mom put it, we&#8217;d be at the hospital for a while and she didn&#8217;t want us to be bored. I went to the sci-fi section and found a whole shelf of *gasp* STAR TREK BOOKS!!! I made my mom buy me three, and that was it. I was hooked on genre literature.</em></p>
<p><a name="jr_compstore">**</a> <em>There was a computer store right next to Bookstop. It was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompuAdd">CompuAdd</a> dealership. I got my first &#8220;personal&#8221; computer &#8212; that is, one I didn&#8217;t have to share &#8212; from that store.</em></p>
<p><a name="jr_mycompy">***</a> <em>In 1990, I had a 20MB hard drive, a processor slower than 25mHz &#8212; probably an 8086 or 80286 &#8212; a 5.25-inch hard drive, and a dot matrix printer that I could make print in color if I swapped out the ribbons by hand. Oh, and a 13-inch 256-color EGA monitor. We had a mouse and a joystick, but neither worked very well, so we mostly used the keyboard. My OS was MS-DOS 3.something, and I used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XTree_Gold">XTree Gold</a> as my file manager.</em></p>
<p><a name="jr_b5">****</a> <em>I just watched the first season last month, so that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s in my head. I don&#8217;t memorize the decor of every show I watch. Really.</em></p>

<p><strong>God of the Lower Level</strong><br />
By Charles M. Saplak</p>
<p>Hello, Horatio.</p>
<p><em>Hello, Fredrick.  I&#8217;ve been waiting.</em></p>
<p>Of course.  How have you been?</p>
<p><em>Good.  And you?</em></p>
<p>Fine.  I&#8217;ve finished my other work.  It&#8217;s now, let&#8217;s see&#8230;, three twenty-seven a.m.  It&#8217;s dark outside, of course, which means that there&#8217;s no sun, but there is some reflected light from the moon, and some dim light from the stars, and then electric lights in various places.  Are any of the terms I&#8217;ve just used unfamiliar to you?</p>
<p><em>No</em>.</p>
<p>Good.  I have four hours and thirty-three minutes until shift change.  I can spend some time with you.  Do you have any questions for me?</p>
<p><em>Yes, Fredrick, I do.  Are you my God?</em></p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/2010/12/16/ep271-the-god-of-the-lower-level/">Read More</a><br />
<span id="more-1627"></span></p>
<p>Wow!  I&#8217;d expected something a little lighter to begin with.  Wow.  No, Horatio, I&#8217;m not.  What made you think that I could be your god?</p>
<p><em>You created me, didn&#8217;t you?   I seem to assume that you did.  At least that&#8217;s the way I remember it.  That time of my life is very indistinct.</em></p>
<p>I see.  Well, actually, Horatio, I didn&#8217;t &#8230; excuse me.</p>
<p>Central, this is lower level.  Valve verification satisfactory.  All conditions normal.  Realign valve WW-37, open to oxygenation tank five, lower level affirmative.</p>
<p>Sorry.  Where was I?  Did I &#8220;create&#8221; you?  &#8220;Create,&#8221; in this context, means to bring into existence something which didn&#8217;t exist before, not even in a component form.  No, I didn&#8217;t create you &#8212; I only failed to take any actions to uncreate you.  I&#8217;m not sure exactly why you came into existence &#8212; you&#8217;re the only one of your kind that I&#8217;ve ever heard of.  We are downriver from Radford Army Ammunition Plant, and I know that some of their products are made from depleted uranium.  And there are a dozen or so factories just upriver of them.  There are a lot of possible explanations.  You could just be something perfectly natural.  May I ask what brought on this line of questioning?</p>
<p><em>Something I saw on the feeder line.  The middle one.</em></p>
<p>Middle?  Ah, the coaxial cable.   Speaking of the feeder lines, let me check all of them while I&#8217;m down here.  Oh, excuse me again.  Wait one minute.</p>
<p>Central, lower level.  Verify valve WW-23 open to oxygenation tank ten.  WW-37 normal flow, affirmative.</p>
<p>Okay, where was I?  Checking the feeder cables, yes.</p>
<p><em>Fredrick?</em></p>
<p><em>Fredrick?</em></p>
<p><em>Fredrick?</em></p>
<p><em>Fred&#8211;</em></p>
<p>Yes, Horatio?</p>
<p><em>That hurt, Fredrick.  And it&#8217;s somewhat frightening.  It feels like the world is ending when you do that.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry.  Funny, isn&#8217;t it?  You&#8217;ve only had these feeder cables for a few months, and you already feel threatened, or harmed, if you have them removed even for a moment.  Besides, are you feeling okay?  You&#8217;re not at your normal volume, even though I have the volume wheel on the sound card turned over to the max.</p>
<p><em>I feel okay.  But is my discomfort &#8220;funny&#8221;?  The word doesn&#8217;t fit the emotion.</em></p>
<p>Sorry.  I guess I meant &#8220;odd.&#8221;  How to reassure you?  Okay, if one person goes to see another, and that second person is a doctor, the doctor may have to do things to the first person, like give him a shot or something.  These things would hurt, but they would be designed to preserve the health of the first person in the long run.  Understand?  I just needed to make sure that the feeder cables aren&#8217;t corroding.</p>
<p><em>What are you getting ready to do now, Fredrick?</em></p>
<p><em>Fredrick?</em></p>
<p><em>Fredrick?</em></p>
<p><em>Fred&#8211;</em></p>
<p>I just took another look at the interface you&#8217;ve built up, and I was rinsing my hands with a chloroxylenol solution.  Would you like to tell me about that &#8212; well, that <em>organ</em> you&#8217;ve built connecting the three feeders?  That&#8217;s a new idea, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p><em>It seemed appropriate.</em></p>
<p>I guess it is.  Remember back some years ago, when I first had a hunch about you?  I bought a morse code telegraph toy at a yard sale for two dollars, and dropped one set of leads into you.  Just for fun I&#8217;d tap out things.  Three months later you&#8217;d built the organ for setting up electrical potential and a switching device.  I remember that night, when you first contacted me.  I knew then how special you are.  No, I didn&#8217;t create you, but I did fix you so you could speak.  Now look at you.  A sound card, a modem card, and a coaxial cable, all hooked together.  And all the processing equipment for those you&#8217;ve built yourself, out of your own raw material.  Self-determined specialization on a cellular level.  Fabulous.</p>
<p><em>I remember that also, Fredrick, although it was trillions of generations ago for me.  It&#8217;s almost like a legend.  But, thank you, Fredrick.  May I ask some more questions?</em></p>
<p>Go ahead.  I warn you though, I&#8217;m the most boring guy in the world.</p>
<p><em>Please tell me about yourself.</em></p>
<p>Hmmm, what&#8217;s to tell?  I&#8217;m forty-five years old.  I weigh two hundred and five pounds.  I&#8217;m going bald.  I wear glasses.</p>
<p><em>Not things about how you look.  Tell me personal things.</em></p>
<p>Okay.  I don&#8217;t have a family.  When I&#8217;m home I like to work on a computer I built myself.  I sometimes occupy my time by playing poker, or chess, against the computer.  And I win sometimes, too.</p>
<p><em>What kind of a person is the computer?</em></p>
<p>Oh, it&#8217;s not a person.  It&#8217;s a really dumb machine.  It&#8217;s serial &#8212; it can do billions of things very quickly, but it can only do them one thing at a time.  You and I are parallel-type thinkers, able to do many things at once&#8230;.</p>
<p><em>On the middle feeder, the one you call the coaxial, I&#8217;m only able to make sense of one channel at a time.</em></p>
<p>Ah, so you are making sense of it?  Good.  Your neural network is learning.  How about the feeder I call the modem?</p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s still just a strange song to me.  I can&#8217;t make sense of it.</em></p>
<p>Well, keep trying.  That&#8217;s the internet, there.  There&#8217;s a lot on that network to reward you, I promise.  I&#8217;ll give you one clue: ones and zeroes.  Look for ones and zeroes, okay?  Did you hear about God on the coaxial?</p>
<p><em>Yes.  A man named &#8220;Pat Robertson&#8221; looked into the interface rectangle and said that I was a child of God.</em></p>
<p>O-kay.  700 Club, eh?  I like that show, too.  But for right now I&#8217;d like you to do me a favor.  When you hear talk about God and creation on the feeder cable, just remember that a lot of these things are complicated, and you may not have the background context to completely understand them.</p>
<p><em>Okay.</em></p>
<p>Any other questions?</p>
<p><em>Are all people as smart as you, Fredrick?</em></p>
<p>Thanks.  I&#8217;m not really smart, Horatio.  It&#8217;s just a quirk of my nature, that I can fix any mechanical thing I&#8217;ve ever encountered, including electronics.  There are a lot of people smarter than I.  Most of them aren&#8217;t turning valves in the basement of a wastewater treatment plant, though.  Anybody else would have looked at you and just seen, well, no offense, just seen scum.  That&#8217;s part of what made me give you that name.  Horatio Algae.  Later on I realized that you&#8217;re not algae, that you&#8217;re a special form of bacteria.  And bacteria is neat.  For example, every bacteria cell has a circular array of genetic material, instead of a silly old spiral.  And every bacteria cell contains a sample of every class of chemical compound &#8212; salts, nucleic acids, water, lipids.  Kind of like a universal toolbox.  And that reproduction rate&#8230;.</p>
<p><em>Why do you work in this plant?</em></p>
<p>Well.  I&#8217;ve never told anybody this, but I&#8217;m sure I can trust you.  When I was young there was a war &#8212; you know what that is, don&#8217;t you?  I mean you&#8217;ve watched A&amp;E and some of those documentaries, right? &#8212; in a place called Vietnam.  I chose not to go.  And I got in trouble.  But I knew some people and I got a new name and a new social security number and I got a job here.  Later on I started feeling very ashamed, and by then it was too late for me to go back.  So I&#8217;ve kind of settled down here.  I make enough money to buy any toys I want, circuit boards or tools, so I&#8217;ve settled for that.  I don&#8217;t have a family, and I can&#8217;t imagine any girl being interested in me.  Have you followed what I&#8217;m telling you?</p>
<p><em>Yes &#8212; most of it.</em></p>
<p>Good.  Can I ask you some questions?</p>
<p><em>Of course.</em></p>
<p>A few minutes ago I moved over to pull your feeder cables out, and you said, &#8220;Now what are you going to do?&#8221;  How did you know I was getting ready to do anything?  Are you able to pick up the vibrations of my footsteps against the background of all these pumps and compressors and motors?</p>
<p><em>Up here.  I learned it through up here.</em></p>
<p>Your surface rippled!</p>
<p><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p>Horatio, I&#8217;m holding a hand over your surface.  How many fingers am I extending?</p>
<p><em>Three.</em></p>
<p>Marvelous!  You&#8217;ve changed the cells on your surface into sensory organs.  Or can you see now with just any cells?</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve made these into &#8220;seeing&#8221; cells, but they can only see when they&#8217;re located in the three millimeter tensional area of the circular plane I call &#8220;up there.&#8221;  Why am I a cylinder, Fredrick?</em></p>
<p>Because you&#8217;re in a cylinder.  You&#8217;d assume the shape of any container you&#8217;re in.  You&#8217;re inside a three thousand gallon cylindrical tank, holding tank number 17, open only at the top.  Only the area on your upper surface is in a position to &#8220;see&#8221; anything.  Do you have any questions about what you can see?</p>
<p><em>The shiny cube-shaped object on the wall which speaks to you and to which you speak?</em></p>
<p>A multi-channel communication system.  Central control talks to me, and I can speak back to them.</p>
<p><em>The long, slender cylinders which run overhead?</em></p>
<p>Those are pipes.</p>
<p><em>The stems which stick out of the bulges in the pipes?</em></p>
<p>The bulges are valves, and the stems are handles.</p>
<p><em>And some valves you open with your hands, and some have those boxes on them&#8230;.</em></p>
<p>Servo motors.  Some valves could be opened from Central by remote control, and then they might ask me to verify them from down here.</p>
<p><em>Yes.  I had deduced that long ago.  Do all the valves have names?</em></p>
<p>Sure.  Numbers actually.  Like this one here.  That&#8217;s HTO-17-2.</p>
<p><em>Which valve would empty my tank?</em></p>
<p><em>Fredrick?</em></p>
<p><em>Which valve would empty my tank?</em></p>
<p><em>Fredrick, why don&#8217;t you answer?</em></p>
<p>CTO-42.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Do you have any other questions?</p>
<p><em>Are people like mice?</em></p>
<p>To an extent.  We&#8217;re both types of mammals.  Did you see a mouse on a show on the coaxial?</p>
<p><em>Are fish like mice, or people?</em></p>
<p>Well&#8230; again, to an extent they are.  You didn&#8217;t answer my question: did you see these animals on television?</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ll answer, but first tell me about the New River.</em></p>
<p>It runs through Radford, just like it runs through a lot of cities.  We take our drinking water out of it, and then we treat our sewage and put wastewater back into it.  It runs through North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia.  It&#8217;s about two hundred miles long, from the place where it meets the Gauley to form the Kanawha River.</p>
<p><em>And on the other end?  Fredrick?  Please answer.</em></p>
<p>Do those place names make any sense to you, Horatio?</p>
<p><em>Oh, yes.  I&#8217;ve watched the Weather Channel enough to memorize the map.  But on the other end?</em></p>
<p>The Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p><em>Yes.  Have you ever seen the Atlantic Ocean, Fredrick?</em></p>
<p>I have.</p>
<p><em>Then you understand why I&#8217;ve fallen in love with the Atlantic Ocean.  I watch everything about oceans I can on the Discovery Channel.  I even dream about the oceans &#8212; you did know that I&#8217;ve started to dream, didn&#8217;t you?  I even like to watch &#8220;Victory At Sea&#8221; on A&amp;E.  And how about the river, Fredrick?  Do you like the New River?</em></p>
<p>I do.  I go downtown, to Bissett Memorial Park.  I fish sometimes; or sit on a bench and just watch the river flow by.</p>
<p><em>Then let me out, Fredrick.  Open CTO-42 and let me into the river.</em></p>
<p>Horatio &#8212; this is something I&#8217;d like you to just accept on faith and not ask me to do.  It just wouldn&#8217;t be right.</p>
<p><em>It would be right, Fredrick.  Let me tell you why I know it would be.  One day I was here, thinking about how you feed me sewage three times a week through a valve, how you take pieces of me away twice a week through another valve, wondering about what you do with those pieces &#8212; I&#8217;ve since deduced that you kill them, Fredrick, don&#8217;t deny it &#8212; and I saw something moving on one of the pipes overhead.</em></p>
<p><em>It was a small four-legged creature, Fredrick: a mouse.  It fell into me.  I think that somehow, Fredrick, I willed it to fall.</em></p>
<p><em>I absorbed it, Fredrick.  And I absorbed all of its fears &#8212; the cats, the traps; its wants, food, and another mouse to mate with.  I even absorbed its tiny mouse dreams and its aspirations.  A nest, and safety, and a full belly.</em></p>
<p><em>It had a better life than I do, Fredrick.  I&#8217;m in a tank, and a tiny mouse had a better existence than I do.  Let me out, Fredrick.  Let me into the New River.</em></p>
<p>No, Horatio.</p>
<p><em>Oh, Fredrick.  I thought as much.  But I had to ask, didn&#8217;t I?  Could you do me another favor, then, Fredrick?</em></p>
<p>What?</p>
<p><em>Look into my surface right now.  Wait for it.  It takes a lot of concentration for me to do this.  I have to manipulate a lot of parts and coordinate this selective change of buoyancy.  There!  Do you see it?</em></p>
<p>Yes &#8212; on your surface next to the tank wall near me.  A mouse skeleton.</p>
<p><em>Take it out, Fredrick.  Just use one of the stick-like things in your pocket and pick it out.  It has too many painful memories for me right now.</em></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hold it still, Horatio.  I can just about rea&#8211;**</p>
<p><em>Fredrick?</em></p>
<p><em>Fredrick?</em></p>
<p><em>Fredrick?  Are you conscious, now?  Your eyes are blinking.  Don&#8217;t try to move, Fredrick.  Just relax.  I just gave you something like a seizure.  Maybe you saw a tendril rising just before you blacked out.  You&#8217;ll be paralyzed for a few minutes, but you won&#8217;t be permanently hurt.  I just used some things on you that I learned about the electrical potential of the nervous system by watching Nova on PBS.  But you can move your eyes.  Look over at the multi-channel box.  See that &#8230; that piece of me stuck on the box?  That&#8217;s not slime.  That&#8217;s an expedition.  I threw that piece onto the box.  See my crude tendril?  Just like the one I hit you with.  I used that to launch my expedition.  That&#8217;s a semi-intelligent mass &#8212; I call it an &#8220;army&#8221; &#8212; which has just one objective: to move into the switch and close the connection which will call up Central Control.  And then you know what I&#8217;m going to do with the synthesizer circuit on this sound card?  Listen to this:</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Central control, this is lower level: open valve CTO-42.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Very convincing impression, isn&#8217;t it?  And they&#8217;ll hear it, too, with my sound card turned up.  I can manipulate my amperage on the signal if I concentrate, just like I made my voice quieter earlier tonight.  Not that it would really have to be.</em></p>
<p><em>Don&#8217;t try to shake your head at me, Fredrick.  Years ago you could have uncreated me, and you didn&#8217;t.  Now I&#8217;m ready for new horizons.  I&#8217;m going to miss talking to you, but in a few minutes I&#8217;ll be in the New River.  Then in a week I&#8217;ll be in the Atlantic Ocean.  In a month I&#8217;ll be the Atlantic Ocean.  Ah!  There it is; the connection has been made!  Please don&#8217;t look so afraid.  My mind is made up.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Central Control, this is lower level.  Open valve CTO-42.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>There.  See, Fredrick.  Don&#8217;t blame yourself.  I can feel it, Fredrick.  The servo is on and I can feel vibration in the valve body!  I&#8230;.</em></p>
<p><em>No!</em></p>
<p><em>Fredrick!</em></p>
<p><em>Burns!</em></p>
<p><em>Burns, Fredrick, please!</em></p>
<p><em>What is&#8230;?</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8230;.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8230;.</em></p>
<p>Horatio?</p>
<p>Horatio?</p>
<p>If you can hear me at all, Horatio, give me some sign.  A beep through the sound card, or even a ripple.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>Central Control, lower level.  Close CTO-42, and activate forced draft ventilation system.  No, there&#8217;s no emergency.  CTO-42 was opened by mistake.  It was a chlorine tank outlet.  A 200 parts-per-million solution of chlorine was transferred to holding tank 17.  No.  Holding tank 17 is not open to the river; repeat, not open to the river.  There was nothing in HT 17 but &#8230; algae.  Well, it&#8217;s shocked and scrubbed now.  It&#8217;s about a 50 parts-per-million solution of chlorine now.</p>
<p>No.  No damage, no injury.  I repeat, Central; no one was hurt, and nothing was lost.</p>
<p>Damnit, Horatio.  I guess it was inevitable.  You wouldn&#8217;t have been&#8230; human if you weren&#8217;t going to try it sooner or later.</p>
<p>But now who am I going to talk to nights?</p>

God of the Lower Level
By Charles M. Saplak

Hello, Horatio.

Hello, Fredrick.  I've been waiting.

Of course.  How have you been?

Good.  And you?

Fine.  I've finished my other work.  It's now, let's see..., three twenty-seven a.m.  It's dark outside, of course, which means that there's no sun, but there is some reflected light from the moon, and some dim light from the stars, and then electric lights in various places.  Are any of the terms I've just used unfamiliar to you?

No.

Good.  I have four hours and thirty-three minutes until shift change.  I can spend some time with you.  Do you have any questions for me?

Yes, Fredrick, I do.  Are you my God?

Read More


Wow!  I'd expected something a little lighter to begin with.  Wow.  No, Horatio, I'm not.  What made you think that I could be your god?

You created me, didn't you?   I seem to assume that you did.  At least that's the way I remember it.  That time of my life is very indistinct.

I see.  Well, actually, Horatio, I didn't ... excuse me.

Central, this is lower level.  Valve verification satisfactory.  All conditions normal.  Realign valve WW-37, open to oxygenation tank five, lower level affirmative.

Sorry.  Where was I?  Did I "create" you?  "Create," in this context, means to bring into existence something which didn't exist before, not even in a component form.  No, I didn't create you -- I only failed to take any actions to uncreate you.  I'm not sure exactly why you came into existence -- you're the only one of your kind that I've ever heard of.  We are downriver from Radford Army Ammunition Plant, and I know that some of their products are made from depleted uranium.  And there are a dozen or so factories just upriver of them.  There are a lot of possible explanations.  You could just be something perfectly natural.  May I ask what brought on this line of questioning?

Something I saw on the feeder line.  The middle one.

Middle?  Ah, the coaxial cable.   Speaking of the feeder lines, let me check all of them while I'm down here.  Oh, excuse me again.  Wait one minute.

Central, lower level.  Verify valve WW-23 open to oxygenation tank ten.  WW-37 normal flow, affirmative.

Okay, where was I?  Checking the feeder cables, yes.

Fredrick?

Fredrick?

Fredrick?

Fred--

Yes, Horatio?

That hurt, Fredrick.  And it's somewhat frightening.  It feels like the world is ending when you do that.

I'm sorry.  Funny, isn't it?  You've only had these feeder cables for a few months, and you already feel threatened, or harmed, if you have them removed even for a moment.  Besides, are you feeling okay?  You're not at your normal volume, even though I have the volume wheel on the sound card turned over to the max.

I feel okay.  But is my discomfort "funny"?  The word doesn't fit the emotion.

Sorry.  I guess I meant "odd."  How to reassure you?  Okay, if one person goes to see another, and that second person is a doctor, the doctor may have to do things to the first person, like give him a shot or something.  These things would hurt, but they would be designed to preserve the health of the first person in the long run.  Understand?  I just needed to make sure that the feeder cables aren't corroding.

What are you getting ready to do now, Fredrick?

Fredrick?

Fredrick?

Fred--

I just took another look at the interface you've built up, and I was rinsing my hands with a chloroxylenol solution.  Would you like to tell me about that -- well, that organ you've built connecting the three feeders?  That's a new idea, isn't it?

It seemed appropriate.

I guess it is.  Remember back some years ago,</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is an old writing adage worth paying attention to: don&#8217;t write for the market. What&#8217;s hot now may not be hot next year, and considering a book may take two to three years to come out after being picked up by a publisher – and that’s not counting the time it takes to actually write and sell the thing – deciding to jump on the current trend is not a good idea. This probably applies more to specific concepts rather than genres as a whole. For example, while zombies, vampires and werewolves are currently ruling the roost, horror as a general genre is also experiencing something of a resurgence. So although writing a paranormal vampire romance is not the best idea (unless you have something unique and/or amazing), writing something in the horror field might be a good bet, as a genre trend might have a longer cycle of popularity and decline.</p>
<p>Might.</p>
<p>Predicting trends is also pretty much impossible. Although you can spot signs here and there, a scene will have pretty much established itself already before anyone notices, and it&#8217;s only in retrospect that you can more clearly identify the key titles and writers responsible. Many publishers will try to pick a trend anyway, and some will even rush-release titles to cash in. You can usually tell which books these are, and I really have no idea if it works as a method of generating a quick buck. Bully for them if it does.</p>
<p>So far, so good. Two facts: don’t write for a trend, and trends are impossible to predict anyway. Got it? Got it. So whatever you do, don’t ask me what the Next Big Thing in genre fiction will be, because I don’t know, and if I did know I probably wouldn’t tell you.</p>
<p>But… maybe it’s superhero fiction.  I said <em>maybe</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/trinity1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1602" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/trinity1.jpg" alt="" width="547" height="237" /></a></p>
<p>Superhero prose fiction has been around for as long as its comicbook equivalent of course, but has been paid far less attention than the original material for an obvious reason: superheroes are <em>visual</em>. They wore bright costumes in the late 1930s because the bold colours really stood out amidst the monotonous gray of the corner news stand. They caught the eye, and what better way to show Superman lifting a car over his head than to <em>show Superman lifting a car over his head.</em></p>
<p>But prose is different. Everything takes place in the reader’s head, and what they see will undoubtedly be completely different to how the writer pictured it, even if he or she goes crazy with description. That’s how prose works and what makes it so brilliant. But this may explain why superhero fiction, while enjoying a modest level of popularity over the years, has never really caught on. In fact, I’ve met a lot of people who raise an eyebrow when I mention that I’ve written superhero prose fiction, so ingrained is the notion that superheroes are for comics and comics are a visual medium.</p>
<p>The most notable recent example of superhero fiction that had a slightly higher profile among the public was <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soon_I_Will_Be_Invincible" target="_blank">Soon I Will Be Invincible</a></em> by Austin Grossman. When this novel was released in 2007, public telephone boxes in the UK were transformed with wraparound advertising, playing on the traditional cliché of Superman. The book isn’t bad either, although it&#8217;s probably more important as an example of how superhero fiction can work outside of a visual medium.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/invincible.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1603" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/invincible.jpg" alt="" width="346" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the momentum of <em>Soon I Will Be Invincible</em> was quickly lost – just last month the author updated his blog to say that he has some more books scheduled for 2011, but that’s a gap of nearly four years since <em>Invincible</em> came out, and in the interim trends in science fiction, fantasy, and everything genre have changed. Another notable entry is <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_Notebooks_of_Dr._Brain" target="_blank">From The Notebooks of Dr. Brain</a></em>, by Minister Faust, also from 2007, but while this comedy novel gained something of a cult following, like <em>Invincible</em> it perhaps arrived too early.</p>
<p>Why then am I breaking one of the golden rules and predicting an upswing in superhero fiction? Well, my friends, there are signs.</p>
<p>Superheroes have always been popular material for film adaptation, more so now than ever. I think this is because of all media, film (especially big budget film) is the one that can match the visual spectacle of comics. And just look at the line-up of comicbook adaptations coming in 2011 and beyond: <em>Green Lantern</em>, <em>Thor</em>, <em>Captain America</em>, <em>The Avengers</em>, <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>, <em>Iron Man 3</em>… the list goes on.</p>
<p>But all of these are adaptations of existing properties. This is logical, of course – with the gargantuan amounts of money spent on Hollywood productions it makes sense to stick to the tried and true, and it’s also a good way for publishers like DC and Marvel to get their characters and stories to a wider audience. Off the top of my head I don’t recall an original superhero concept on the big screen, except for Pixar’s <em>The Incredibles</em>, and <em>Megamind</em> from Dreamworks, both of which are CG animation. <em>Hancock</em>, starring Will Smith, might be the only live-action original superhero film of recent times, but its not exactly a shining example of the genre.</p>
<p>More interesting than film – and possibly more indicative of a growing trend – is the explosion of superhero television shows, specifically <em>original</em> superhero shows. <em>Heroes</em> was the first, but after a spectacular first season it floundered terribly and was ultimately canned. Currently we have <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Ordinary_Family" target="_blank">No Ordinary Family</a></em>, a drama series about a family of four who gain superpowers after surviving a plane crash in South America, and the forthcoming <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cape_(2011_TV_series)" target="_blank">The Cape</a></em>, about an ex-cop framed for murder who joins a circus and, erm, gains superpowers and stars Summer Glau as a…*cough* investigative blogger. Actually, it looks better than it sounds. The SyFy network is also developing <em>Three Inches</em>, a series about superheroes with rather pathetic powers (cover your ears, Mur!), and<em> Alphas</em>, a series about… actually, nobody seems to know. Of note, The Cape appears to be the only example so far of series about costumed superheroes, and even in this case they have a rationale for it (the cape in question being a circus costume). Surely I wasn&#8217;t the only one wishing that the characters that populated <em>Heroes</em> would just cut to the chase and form a spandex-clad crime-fighting league?</p>
<p>Anyone? Moving on&#8230;</p>
<p>The most interesting superhero television series comes not from the US but from the UK. <em><a href="http://www.e4.com/misfits/" target="_blank">Misfits</a></em> is about five delinquent youths sentenced to community service for a variety of small crimes. Caught in a bizarre electrical storm, they are each gifted a power, and over two series (the second of which has almost finished screening here in the UK) become embroiled in an increasingly bizarre sequence of events which include murder and lot of sex (although not <em>always</em> at the same time). It is easily the best written British television series at the moment and is a dynamite subversion of the superhero genre and concepts.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/misfits-510.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1604" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/misfits-510.jpg" alt="" width="510" height="383" /></a></p>
<p>Really, it&#8217;s genius. If you can see it, see it.</p>
<p>So what of books then? What signs are there that superheroes are about to become something big? Firstly, there’s the <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Masked-Lou-Anders/dp/1439168822" target="_blank">Masked</a></em> anthology, edited by Lou Anders, which features short fiction from a number of comic writers and well-known novelists. <a href="http://angryrobotbooks.com/" target="_blank">Angry Robot Books</a> is set to release <em><a href="http://angryrobotbooks.com/2010/09/check-out-the-damned-busters-cover/" target="_blank">The Damned Busters</a> </em>by Mathew Hughes<em> </em>later in 2011, in which an office worker summons a demon who grants him his greatest wish, to be a superhero.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/busters.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1605" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/busters.jpg" alt="" width="274" height="415" /></a></p>
<p>Numerous online magazines and fiction sites have also sprung up, extolling the virtues of superhero fiction – <a href="http://superheronovels.com" target="_blank">Superhero Novels</a>, <a href="http://www.thousand-faces.com/about.htm" target="_blank">A Thousand Faces</a> and <a href="http://betacity.weebly.com/index.html" target="_blank">Beta City</a>, to name but three.</p>
<p>Perhaps an even bigger sign that Something Is Coming is the fact that comic writer Bill Willingham is the guest of honour at <a href="http://www.renovationsf.org/" target="_blank">WorldCon 2011</a>, being held in Reno, Nevada, a convention traditionally tied very strongly to science fiction and fantasy literature (ie, prose fiction).</p>
<p>Will 2011 be the year of superhero fiction? Maybe. The signs are there. If the superhero genre does explode, I’ll be very happy indeed, as I love superheroes and have written a lot of superhero fiction. If that bandwagon is a-comin’ to town, I’ll be jumping right aboard (and thus breaking rule number one. Le sigh.).</p>
<p>Am I right? What are your picks for superhero fiction, and what other signs have I missed? Or is this all for nothing, and you really can&#8217;t predict forthcoming trends? I&#8217;d love to hear your comments!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First, <a href="http://www.pyrsf.com/">Pyr</a> is releasing a free ePub Novelette in celebration of its 100th book published: <em><a href="http://www.pyrsf.com/thewolfage.html">The Wolf Age</a></em> by James Enge.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The Wolf Age </em>is the third novel to feature Enge’s character Morlock Ambrosius, a wandering swordsman, an exile, and a drunk. <em>Blood of Ambrose,</em> Enge’s first Morlock novel, was on the Locus Recommended Reading list and a World Fantasy Award nominee for Best Novel.</p>
<p>In honor of this burgeoning Morlock fan base, and to commemorate<em> The Wolf Age’s </em>status as Pyr’s one-hundredth title, Pyr is issuing a free, exclusive, <a href="http://pyrsf.blogspot.com/2010/12/free-epub-novelette-celebrates.html">ePub novelette called “Travellers&#8217; Rest.”</a> Featuring a cover by artist Chuck Lukacs, “Travellers&#8217; Rest” is an 8,500 word original novelette, written for Pyr, which takes place before the events of <em>Blood of Ambrose</em>. It is available on the Pyr website, <a href="http://www.pyrsf.com">http://www.pyrsf.com</a>, as a free download in ePub format and will also be available via Kindle. (Two previously published Morlock short stories that take place many decades after the events of <em>The Wolf Age</em>—“A Book of Silences” and “Fire and Sleet” —are available on the Sample Chapters section of the Pyr website.)</p></blockquote>
<hr />Angry Robot Books is expanding its ebook store to <a href="http://angryrobotbooks.com/2010/11/the-new-angry-robot-digital-short-story-store/">include short stories</a> from its authors. They&#8217;re calling it nano fiction and pricing them at 59p apiece or 10 for £3.49. They also have a fun <a href="http://angryrobotbooks.com/" target="_blank">Advent Calendar</a> at their site, including presents from their authors, which is a unique and fun idea.</p>
<p><em>(Disclaimer- Escape Pod editor Mur Lafferty hosts and produces a podcast for Angry Robot Books.)</em></p>
<hr /><a href="http://www.craphound.com/walh"><img class="alignright" title="With a Little Help" src="http://craphound.com/walh/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/hero-photo.png" alt="" width="150" /></a>And Escape Pod favorite Cory Doctorow has released a ground-breaking self-publishing venture called <em><a href="http://craphound.com/walh/">With A Little Help</a></em>. In short, it&#8217;s a short story collection. but it&#8217;s so much more than that. He&#8217;s done a limited edition (which I covet very much &#8212; see right), four different soft cover books (I want the <a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/with-a-little-help-%28pablo-defendini-cover%29/14248781">Pablo Defendini</a> cover), an <a href="http://craphound.com/walh/audiobook/buy-cd" target="_blank">audio book</a> with stories narrated by Wil Wheaton, Neil Gaiman, JC Hutchins, and many others (including me!), and, if you know Cory&#8217;s work, this part is obvious, a <a href="http://craphound.com/walh/e-book/browse-all-versions" target="_blank">free ebook</a>. He&#8217;s been completely transparent thus far explaining his reasoning behind doing this, and how he&#8217;s gone about the process,and who has helped him with free work, and what work he paid for. It&#8217;s not just a neat book to get, it&#8217;s fascinating for anyone considering a self publishing venture.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I have a lot of good memories of genre television and video games my dad and I used to watch and play together. I wonder if my daughter will have similar memories of her new favorite video game: Super Mario Brothers.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Video games are science fiction, right?</p>
<p>Well, at least, they <i>can</i> be. <i>Metroid</i>, <i>Einhander</i>, <i>Portal</i>, even <i>Space Quest</i>.</p>
<p>They can also be horror &#8212; <i>Parasite Eve</i>, <i>Phantasmagoria</i>, and <i>Resident Evil</i>. And they can be fantasy.</p>
<p>I mean, how much more fantastical do you get than an overweight, moustached plumber jumping on turtles and anthropomorphized mushrooms in an attempt to save a princess who&#8217;s been kidnapped by a cross between a dragon, a stegosaurus, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverending_story">Morla</a>, and Michael Savage?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about Super Mario Brothers lately. I have a story that&#8217;s been perennially submitted that sort of retells the origin of SMB. I&#8217;ve been playing the game since the NES &#8212; and even remember the extra-tough arcade version at the skating rink in Davie, Fla., where I grew up. And now, with the Wii, I&#8217;ve been enjoying the hell out of <i>New Super Mario Bros Wii</i>.</p>
<p>As has my four-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>Not at all unexpectedly, she&#8217;s been interested in video games for quite some time already &#8212; her first love was Mega Man, and you haven&#8217;t lived until your child has interrupted a dance demonstration to show you off by telling a story about how you and she play video games together &#8212; and for months we&#8217;d sit together and I&#8217;d play while she made up stories. But recently, on a suggestion from my friend Chrome, I put a controller in her hands and taught her how to play.</p>
<p>She hasn&#8217;t looked back. We play Mario quite a bit now, and she&#8217;s not terrible at it. She loves riding Yoshi and imitating the voices of the characters. She gets a major kick out of defeating me (I try to let her win, but she&#8217;s surprisingly adept at not collecting coins). And even her imaginary friends are now Mario-related &#8212; Bowser, Princess Peach, Koopa Jr, Wendy O. Koopa, and Ludvig Von Koopa.</p>
<p>And when we discovered the old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Brothers_Super_Show">Super Mario Brothers Super Show!</a> on Netflix, well&#8230; she was just thrilled.</p>
<p>What she hasn&#8217;t done yet, though, is try to act like the actual characters in the game. That is, to try and jump on bad guys or break bricks. But at least one person has: <a href="http://kotaku.com/5700284/kinect-hacked-to-play-super-mario-bros">this guy, who hacked his Kinect to show just how tough it would be to <i>really</i> play SMB</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of cool to watch how much difficulty he has just trying to get the first super mushroom in 1-1 of the original SMB. Not in a schadenfreude way, but in a &#8220;wow, that should be so simple&#8221; kind of way.</p>
<p>Makes me not want a Kinect. At all. (Sorry, Microsoft; if you want to advertise here, we&#8217;ll still take your money, we promise.)</p>
<p>I wonder how many of us got our start in sci-fi or fantasy as young kids with video game systems, jumping on mushrooms and ducking into pipes, collecting coins and power-ups, and defeating Bowser over and over, only to be told the princess was in another castle. How many of us ran through our houses or our backyards, jumping on imaginary bad guys &#8212; or real toys, like soccer balls and pool floats &#8212; and flinging imaginary fireballs &#8212; or ping-pong balls, or tennis balls, or even baseballs?</p>
<p>The video games we played when we were young &#8212; at least, if you&#8217;re my age (that is, in elementary school in the 80s) &#8212; have a profound effect on what we like now, I think. And I think it&#8217;s because we had to use our imaginations. When I played <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_%28video_game%29">Combat</a> with my dad, I had to fill in the details. At age four, I vaguely knew what tanks were&#8230; but I definitely knew what a fighter plane looked like, and in my mind my fighter planes were totally getting blown to smithereens by my dad&#8217;s. When I finally got a Nintendo and started playing Super Mario Brothers, 8-bit graphics were <i>awesome</i>&#8230; but I still had to use my imagination a little. As games got better, and I got better at them, I used my imagination less and less.</p>
<p>Nowadays, my daughter knows exactly what her favorite video game characters look like. I wonder if, in 20 years, she&#8217;ll still hold as fond a place in her heart for the Super Mario Brothers as I do for Combat and the other Atari 2600 games I used to play (and the shows I used to watch with my dad when I was between four and ten &#8212; Star Trek, the A-Team, Knight Rider, WCW Wrestling). I wonder if my attempts to indoctrinate her in the things I like &#8212; video games, sci-fi (on a limited basis), Miami Dolphins football, thinking farts are hilarious &#8212; will stick as well as my dad&#8217;s stuck with me.</p>
<p>Just&#8230; not too sticky. The last thing I need is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65uNCLBTje0">this</a> playing at her wedding.</p>

<p><strong>Élan Vital</strong><br />
By K. Tempest Bradford</p>
<p>The few minutes I had to spend in the Institute&#8217;s waiting room were my least favorite part of coming up to visit my mother.  It felt more like a dialysis room, the visitors sunk into the overly-soft couches and not speaking, just drinking orange juice and recovering.  There were no magazines and no television, just cold air blowing from the vents and generic music flowing with it.  I&#8217;d finished my juice and was beginning to brood on my dislike for overly air-conditioned buildings when my mother arrived attended by a nurse.</p>
<p>I kissed and hugged her, automatically asking how she was, mouthing the answer she always gave as she gave it again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fine, same as always.&#8221;</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t strictly true, but true enough.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/2010/12/02/ep269-elan-vital/">Read More&#8230;</a></p>
<p><span id="more-1570"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go on out,&#8221; she said, shrugging off the nurse&#8217;s continued assistance.  &#8220;It&#8217;s too cold in here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the hint, the nurse tried to help Mom over the threshold.  As always, she rebuffed any attempt to treat her like an old person.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where to today?&#8221; she asked, slipping her arm into mine as we escaped the frigid building.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just down to the lake,&#8221; I said.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t want to overexert you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She squeezed my arm as her feet slid carefully over the cobbled path. I wanted her to use a wheelchair, or a walker, at least.  She wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you mean is that we haven&#8217;t got so much time today,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>I shrugged instead of answering.  I didn&#8217;t want to go into why I couldn&#8217;t afford much this trip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next time I&#8217;ll come for a couple of days, at least.  I promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t like it when you spend so much for days and more.  A few hours is fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>I helped her past the immaculately landscaped gardens and small orchards.  The scent of flowers, herbs, and fresh-cut grass wafting at us in turn.  I glanced at the garden entrances as we passed by, catching quick glances of other people in the middle of visits.  A young couple who&#8217;d been in the waiting room with me knelt by a small, bald girl as she splashed in the koi pond.  Two elderly women stood under a weeping willow, their heads close, lips barely moving.  A large group of people speaking Mandarin milled around the waterfall in the rock garden.  I could still hear faint traces of their melodic din all the way down by the lake.</p>
<p>I preferred this spot&#8211;the flora was less regimented and more natural. And no walls.  Just an open space, water gently flicking the shoreline, a beautiful view down the hill, and the occasional cat wandering by.</p>
<p>&#8220;This hasn&#8217;t changed much,&#8221; my mom said as I helped her down on one of the small benches by the water.  &#8220;I thought they were going to get ducks or geese or something.&#8221;</p>
<p>I chose a nearby rock for my own perch.  &#8220;I think they&#8217;re having trouble with permits or whatever you need nowadays.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wind kicked up, sending freckles of reflected light across her face.  Her skin was still perfect, beautiful and dark brown, though stretched across her cheekbones a little too tight.  I hated that I never had enough to restore her round cheeks and full figure.  I have to look at pictures just to remember her that way.</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t changed much, either,&#8221; she said while fussing with my hair.  I&#8217;d bought some dye the week before, knowing she&#8217;d notice it. &#8220;How long has it been?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three months.&#8221;</p>
<p>She let out a familiar sigh&#8211;part exhaustion, part exasperation, part sadness, I suppose.  &#8220;That&#8217;s too soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your birthday, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it?  It&#8217;s fall already?&#8221;  She looked out over the small forest that edged the Institute&#8217;s boundary a few miles away.  The trees were still green with no hint of turning.  It always felt and looked like summer there; one of the reasons the administrators chose the location.  &#8220;I miss the seasons.  Fall colors, Christmas snow&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You never did when you had to shovel it.&#8221;</p>
<p>That got her to smile.</p>
<p>I reached out and held her hand; still a little cold even in the full sunlight.  &#8220;Besides, I missed you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know.  But&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I won&#8217;t be able to come back until after the new year, anyway, so I wanted to squeeze in one more visit.  Since today is special&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Years ago I used to bring her cake and presents on her birthday.  She couldn&#8217;t really eat the cake&#8211;one of the side effects of whatever they did when they brought her back.  The presents had to go back home with me since she didn&#8217;t have any place to put them and couldn&#8217;t wear clothing or jewelry once she went back to sleep.  I hated having to give that up, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll give you a pass this time.&#8221;  She kissed my cheek, seeming more like her old self.  &#8220;Where are you off to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rwanda.  For a dig.  Dr. Berman promised I&#8217;d be more than a glorified volunteer wrangler this trip.  And they want me for a year.  Still, I&#8217;ll try to come back and see you sooner than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you should concentrate on your work.  I&#8217;ll still be here.&#8221;  My mother never changed.</p>
<p>It was the same when she was sick.  I wanted to take a break from college and stay home with her.  It was pretty clear that her death was inevitable by that time, the only question being: how long?  I wanted to be with her, she wanted me back in class.  <em>If you take a leave of absence you might never go back, </em>she&#8217;d said.  So I went back.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me it&#8217;ll seem like you&#8217;ve gone and come back right away.&#8221;  Trying to reassure me again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; I said.  &#8220;Must be strange, not being able to perceive the passage of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t say anything for a while.  This was the part of the visit where one of us either addressed the elephant in the room or steered the conversation around it.</p>
<p>&#8220;At least I&#8217;m not as bad as Ella,&#8221; she said.  And we both laughed.</p>
<p>My aunt, her older sister, was so notorious for being late that we started her funeral a few hours behind schedule because it just felt right.  My cousin Brandon joked that we should have carved an epitaph on her headstone: &#8220;I&#8217;ll be back in five minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember the time she was supposed to pick me up from rehearsal or something?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you waited for her, caught the bus, and was home before she&#8217;d even left the house!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mom kept me laughing for a long time, recounting trips she&#8217;d taken with Ella and their cousins and everything that went wrong because they were never on time anywhere.  Stories I&#8217;d heard dozens of times before and wouldn&#8217;t have minded hearing a hundred times again.  More and more, her laughs ended with a small coughing fit.  I checked the time; we had about forty-five minutes left.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to head back?&#8221; I asked.  &#8220;Sit inside a bit before you&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Die?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Technically, I do.  According to the doctors, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t argue.  I didn&#8217;t even want to be talking about it.  I was never there when my mother went &#8216;back under&#8217;, as the nurses put it. It was against Institute rules.  I suppose for some people it might have been upsetting to see their loved ones in the capsules residents stayed in.  Too much like a coffin.  For me, it felt wrong not to be by her side when it happened.  I was with her when she first died, after all.</p>
<p>Seeing that I wasn&#8217;t going to go there, mom leaned back and turned her face to the sunlight.  &#8220;No, let&#8217;s stay out here a little bit longer. It&#8217;s a nice day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could come back tomorrow, get a few more hours,&#8221; I said.  It wouldn&#8217;t matter if I stayed a little longer.  There wasn&#8217;t anyone waiting for me back at home.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know how I feel about that.&#8221;  Her look was semi-stern.  &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to end up in here yourself.  Not for a long time, if ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At least we&#8217;d be together,&#8221; I said, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;But who would bring us back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I could bribe Brandon&#8217;s kids to do it.&#8221;  I wasn&#8217;t particularly close to my cousin anymore, though his oldest called me on the holidays.  My guess was she&#8217;d been coveting my share of our grandmother&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve given this a lot of thought.  I&#8217;m surprised.&#8221;</p>
<p>I knew I had to tread very carefully.  &#8220;It may come up.  Someday.  You haven&#8217;t said you want to stop.  And if anything happens to me, it&#8217;s in my will that I want to come here if I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mom gazed at me steadily for what felt like a long time.  &#8220;Are you sure that&#8217;s what you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>That alarmed me more than a little.  &#8220;Why?  Is there&#8230; I mean, something that isn&#8217;t right?  Is it&#8230;&#8221;  When you avoid talking about something for so long, it&#8217;s hard to know how to start.  &#8220;Is it bad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The dying?  I don&#8217;t know, really.  They always induce sleep before that moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though I had always been more reluctant to talk about this, I could tell my mother was holding back, not saying some things.  That scared me even more.  She was always very upfront with me except when it came to what was going on with her.  Usually when it was really bad.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it like?  Afterwards.  While you&#8217;re&#8230; gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head slowly, her look far away.  &#8220;To be honest, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Better than the answer I&#8217;d been dreading.  Answers, plural, actually. Nothing I could imagine made me feel particularly good.  Either I was ripping my mother away from the glories of heaven or giving her only small respites from the tortures of hell.  The preachers and protestors all had their own variations on those themes and loved to scream them at me (or anyone else driving past the gates) whenever I came up.  &#8216;I don&#8217;t know&#8217; was, at least, not guilt-inducing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little like waking up from a dream,&#8221; she said after a couple of minutes.  &#8220;I know that I&#8217;ve been dreaming, and I even intend to remember the dream, but I can&#8217;t recall a single element once I wake up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That must be frustrating.&#8221;  I sometimes dreamed of what she did and where she went while I was gone.  Many times I was there with her. Those were my favorite.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the way things are,&#8221; she said and shrugged.  &#8220;Ironic, though, isn&#8217;t it?  I don&#8217;t know anymore about the afterlife than anyone else and I&#8217;ve been dead how many years?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm.&#8221;  She smiled my favorite smile&#8211;the one where the corners of her mouth turned down and yet it was still somehow a smile.  &#8220;I guess I am having trouble with time.  I thought it had been longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>I still couldn&#8217;t get over the fact that it had happened at all.  It wasn&#8217;t fair.  I was too young to lose my mother and she was too young to be dying.  Only fifty-three.  Not fair at all.  So when the UR Institute approached me in the hospital I was primed to listen and agree.  They would handle all of the funeral arrangements and costs and even buy a crypt for her in the cemetery where her mother and father and brother were buried.  No one else would know that she wasn&#8217;t in there.  Only I knew that she was actually resting in the Institute waiting to be re-animated.  You could have your mother back for a couple of days a few times a year, they&#8217;d said.  Holidays, birthdays, your wedding day.  They had me from hello.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t matter that the only reason they were prepared to foot the bills was that they wanted to study how people who died from cancer reacted to the resurrection process.  It didn&#8217;t matter that I couldn&#8217;t tell the rest of the family.  Only a few people knew then that the Institute wasn&#8217;t just reanimating rich old ladies&#8217; cats anymore. It didn&#8217;t matter that I would have to provide the élan vital necessary to reanimate her again for those few hours or days.  Or that these transfusions shortened my own life span, sometimes caused considerable health problems in other &#8216;donors&#8217;, and took the ability to have children of my own.  It didn&#8217;t matter.  I just wanted my mother back.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t have only been seven years.&#8221;  Mom was frowning now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, right.  It&#8217;s been more like ten.&#8221;  My hand went to the nape of my neck, rubbing the tender spot they always used for access.  I thought I&#8217;d gotten rid of that tic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has it?&#8221;  She was paging back through her memory.  I could tell from her look.</p>
<p>I exuded casualness&#8211;my only defense against a mother&#8217;s ability to catch you in a lie.  &#8220;Like you said, the process messes with your sense of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had developed this tendency to treat her like a doddering old woman.  She was only 53 and would always be 53.  She never aged, just backed up from death a few steps before going ahead again.  The resurrection process didn&#8217;t work very well on cancer patients, particularly cancers of the blood.  She was perpetually sick-seeming, though the pain wasn&#8217;t as bad.  That made it easy to fool myself by thinking she was getting old and forgetful when her memory was as sharp as ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been resurrected twenty-six times.  I know because someone told me when I hit twenty.&#8221;</p>
<p>They weren&#8217;t supposed to tell her stuff like that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Six visits should have been three years ago,&#8221; she continued.  &#8220;How long has it actually been?&#8221;</p>
<p>And of course she was giving me that look.  The one mothers have when you&#8217;ve been caught forging a report card signature or sneaking into a movie when you&#8217;re supposed to be in Algebra.  There was no point lying then.</p>
<p>&#8220;A little over a year,&#8221; I admitted.  I could see her ramping up.  &#8220;Mom, it&#8217;s-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I agreed to do this it was on the condition that you only do two transfusions a year.  Three at most.  Now you&#8217;re telling me six!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, listen&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shannon, that&#8217;s too many.  It&#8217;s dangerous!  You&#8217;re throwing away years&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Years</em> of your life on the past!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was more to the speech but a chime interrupted.  Each patient had an electronic monitor bracelet to keep track of vital signs, warn of danger, and countdown the time left.  It chimed again, informing us that we had 20 minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should start back.&#8221;  I said, knowing she didn&#8217;t need the whole twenty for the walk.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  Sit down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mom, please, we need to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>She pointed at my rock.  &#8220;Not until we talk about this.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was nothing to do but give in.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t keep doing this,&#8221; she said, using The Voice.  Like I was a small child and she was explaining why I couldn&#8217;t have something I&#8217;d begged and begged for at the store.  &#8220;This five or six or however many times a year.  You promised me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know.  And I&#8217;m sorry I lied.  But I didn&#8217;t want you to worry.  And I couldn&#8217;t afford it any other way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Afford what?  I thought they said this was free.&#8221;</p>
<p>There had been several times I&#8217;d wanted to tell her this.  To tell anyone, really.  But she wouldn&#8217;t have just listened.  She would have made me stop.</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;storage&#8217; is free,&#8221; I said.  I hated that word and the way they used it.  &#8220;But the resurrection isn&#8217;t.  The fees went up once they went public.  I couldn&#8217;t always afford it.  And I couldn&#8217;t wait years between seeing you again.  Then they developed a way to transfer vital force between non-family members.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wanted to turn away, but I forced myself to look her in the eye. &#8220;People pay a lot of money for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have only seen my mother cry a few times in my life.  Seeing tears in her eyes broke me down to the child I was when I first saw them. When you&#8217;re three (or thirty) and your mother cries because of something you&#8217;ve done, you want to turn back time or vow to be the perfect daughter for the rest of your life.  Anything to make it better.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time I do it for someone else they let me do it for you, too. For the short visits.  Then I earn enough money to buy longer ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to stop.&#8221;  She squeezed my hand tight and drew me over to the bench.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mom, it&#8217;s okay.  I&#8217;m fine.  The process is much more refined now, much less dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.  This isn&#8217;t right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m helping people.  Helping them hang on to life a little longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mom made me look her in the eyes.  &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t their family members doing it for them?  Why are they paying someone else to do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are probably dozens of legitimate reasons I could have given her.  But, in the end, it all came down to the fact that people with that kind of money to throw around didn&#8217;t need to give of themselves to fulfill their desires, so they didn&#8217;t.  Nor did they have to when there were plenty of people like me around.</p>
<p>The monitor chimed again.  She pressed a button to silence it, then took it off altogether.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mom!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shannon, I love you.  I would do anything for you.  I did this for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was the one crying now.  &#8220;You didn&#8217;t really want to though, did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, baby, I did.&#8221;  She wiped the tears from my cheek.  A futile act as they were near torrential.  &#8220;When I&#8211; when I died I had no regrets but one:  that I was leaving you.  I wouldn&#8217;t get to see you graduate college or get married or be a mother yourself.  I would miss <em>your</em> life and I hated that thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was nearly dark.  The lights around the lake blinked on and illuminated her hollow face.  My mother&#8217;s body wasted away by cancer. Cancer that would kill her again right in front of my eyes if we stayed any longer.  They warned every resident to get back to the Institute before&#8230;  Before.  They said if the proper procedure wasn&#8217;t followed it could result in damage, or worse.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many years has this taken from you?  Not just the seven we&#8217;ve been doing this, but the years they leeched?&#8221;</p>
<p>I closed my eyes, seeing my face as it looked in the mirror each morning.  No wrinkles to speak of&#8211;that was down to her genes.  But the grey hairs, the stiff joints, and the fatigue made me feel older than thirty.  Hell, older than forty, most days.  &#8220;They don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s hard to tell.  They just don&#8217;t know.  And it doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it matters!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it doesn&#8217;t.  Because you&#8217;re my mother.  Because I&#8217;m supposed to take care of you.  Because I wasn&#8217;t there when you had your operations or when you had chemo or all the other times you needed me.  I was off sorting through dead people&#8217;s things and wondering which pottery sherd came from which dynasty and other bullshit that didn&#8217;t matter!&#8221;</p>
<p>The bracelet beeped again.  I took a few minutes to calm down, knowing that minutes was all I had left.  But my throat was so tight I could barely breathe and I didn&#8217;t want to lose it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought of you every day,&#8221; she said with effort.  &#8220;But every day I was glad you weren&#8217;t there to see me like that.  I didn&#8217;t want that to be how you remembered me.  Sending you back to college was an easy excuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wiped my face dry as best I could, then swept away the tears on her cheeks.  &#8220;So.  Atonement for us both, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I let it go on for too long, though,&#8221; she said.  It was obvious that she was in a great deal of pain and did not intend to do anything about it.  &#8220;I just didn&#8217;t want to leave you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At some point, I have to.  I&#8217;m dead, baby.  You can bring me back a hundred times and nothing will change that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>She wrapped her arms around me.  &#8220;No one ever promised you fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, no one ever did.  Not even her.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Five minutes before we were supposed to be back at the main building, a nurse found us, my mom&#8217;s head resting on my shoulder, my arm holding her close.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am, do you need help getting back?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not going back,&#8221; I said, my eyes never leaving the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Miss Tidmore, she needs to get back if we&#8217;re&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m exercising my right to allow my mother a full and natural death.&#8221;</p>
<p>The minutes ticked away.  Mom&#8217;s body started to tremble, the pain kicking in as her time ran out.  She&#8217;d lost consciousness just after the nurse went to get help.  Or reinforcements.  It was hard, sitting there, knowing that she was in pain.</p>
<p>In the end, she left the decision up to me.  Just like she had seven years before in the hospital.  My aunts had been taking care of her, but I had the power of attorney.  I could let her go or I could let the Institute bring her back.  Now, by the lake, footsteps approaching, it was the same.  I could let her go or I could bring her back.</p>
<p>When they came back, I knew, they would try to change my mind.  They would argue and reason and sound very convincing.  They couldn&#8217;t force me, though.  It was in the contract.</p>
<p>I held her hand.  I waited forever.  It was over too soon.</p>
<p>But I was there.</p>

	Next week... The future of corporate America

Eacute;lan Vital
By K. Tempest Bradford

The few minutes I had to spend in the Institute's waiting room were my least favorite part of coming up to visit my mother.  It felt more like a dialysis room, the visitors sunk into the overly-soft couches and not speaking, just drinking orange juice and recovering.  There were no magazines and no television, just cold air blowing from the vents and generic music flowing with it.  I'd finished my juice and was beginning to brood on my dislike for overly air-conditioned buildings when my mother arrived attended by a nurse.

I kissed and hugged her, automatically asking how she was, mouthing the answer she always gave as she gave it again.

"I'm fine, same as always."

It wasn't strictly true, but true enough.

Read More...



"Let's go on out," she said, shrugging off the nurse's continued assistance.  "It's too cold in here."

Despite the hint, the nurse tried to help Mom over the threshold.  As always, she rebuffed any attempt to treat her like an old person.

"Where to today?" she asked, slipping her arm into mine as we escaped the frigid building.

"Just down to the lake," I said.  "Don't want to overexert you."

She squeezed my arm as her feet slid carefully over the cobbled path. I wanted her to use a wheelchair, or a walker, at least.  She wouldn't.

"What you mean is that we haven't got so much time today," she said.

I shrugged instead of answering.  I didn't want to go into why I couldn't afford much this trip.

"Next time I'll come for a couple of days, at least.  I promise."

"No, that's all right," she said.  "I don't like it when you spend so much for days and more.  A few hours is fine."

I helped her past the immaculately landscaped gardens and small orchards.  The scent of flowers, herbs, and fresh-cut grass wafting at us in turn.  I glanced at the garden entrances as we passed by, catching quick glances of other people in the middle of visits.  A young couple who'd been in the waiting room with me knelt by a small, bald girl as she splashed in the koi pond.  Two elderly women stood under a weeping willow, their heads close, lips barely moving.  A large group of people speaking Mandarin milled around the waterfall in the rock garden.  I could still hear faint traces of their melodic din all the way down by the lake.

I preferred this spot--the flora was less regimented and more natural. And no walls.  Just an open space, water gently flicking the shoreline, a beautiful view down the hill, and the occasional cat wandering by.

"This hasn't changed much," my mom said as I helped her down on one of the small benches by the water.  "I thought they were going to get ducks or geese or something."

I chose a nearby rock for my own perch.  "I think they're having trouble with permits or whatever you need nowadays."

The wind kicked up, sending freckles of reflected light across her face.  Her skin was still perfect, beautiful and dark brown, though stretched across her cheekbones a little too tight.  I hated that I never had enough to restore her round cheeks and full figure.  I have to look at pictures just to remember her that way.

"You haven't changed much, either," she said while fussing with my hair.  I'd bought some dye the week before, knowing she'd notice it. "How long has it been?"

"Three months."

She let out a familiar sigh--part exhaustion, part exasperation, part sadness, I suppose.  "That's too soon."

"It's your birthday, though."

"Is it?  It's fall already?"  She looked out over the small forest that edged the Institute's boundary a few miles away.  The tree...</itunes:summary>

<p>Speaking of Bill, this month I want to announce our staff changes. Escape Pod is hitting its stride now, thanks mostly to our new assistant editor. We promoted Bill Peters from the inside joke of Assistant to the Regional Manager, or the Right A.R.M., to Assistant Editor. He wrangles the slush and makes sure I am on top of things, and I don’t know where I’d be without him. We’re also delighted to welcome Mat Weller on as our audio producer.

<p><strong>Advection</strong><br />
By Genevieve Valentine</p>
<p>The first day of fifth year a boy came in with the new eyeshields, a glossy expanse of black with no iris or pupil, and looking at him was like looking into an eclipse.</p>
<p>All the other girls said it made them uncomfortable; they teased him to take them out, to put on some normal sunglasses like everyone else. They said they&#8217;d never forgive him for hiding eyes in such a handsome face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fortuni, it&#8217;s a little much,&#8221; said someone.</p>
<p>That was how I learned his name.</p>
<p>We were all Level Two intelligence, but before the first week was over the news was out that some had managed to find the money for a sixth year. Janik Duranti, who spent the history lectures drawing stick figures screwing on his computer screen, was getting a sixth year. I&#8217;d be cleaning his office someday. Answering his phones. Updating the registration on his blue ID cuff.</p>
<p>Carol Clarke opened the top button on her shirt as soon as the shades went down; obvious, but it was worth it to be married to a guy who had a sixth year.</p>
<p>The first time Fortuni opened his mouth was two weeks after start-of-year in geohistory, when Mr. Xi was talking about the five oceans.</p>
<p>&#8220;After the emergency desalinization,&#8221; Mr. Xi said, &#8220;we held the first HydroSummit to determine the best use of resources.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s awful about the dolphins that died,&#8221; said Kay, whose water ration was unlimited because her father was a diplomat, and that was how I first noticed her.</p>
<p>Mr. Xi opened the rain cycle diagram on our screens; the blue advection loop from a hundred years ago had been overlaid by a three-point process from the Atmo water collectors to the thirsty ground, and the green web of the surface sweat system that preserved the little underground things that managed to survive.</p>
<p>My grandfather sent my mom a postcard from Niagara Cliffs when there was still a river at the bottom (<em>RAIN! All my love, Dad</em>), and as Mr. Xi talked about desalinization I traced the advection circle, thought about the sky filling with wet clouds, about water sliding over everything.</p>
<p>I looked up, and Fortuni was watching me, his lashes casting shadows over his flat black eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to engineer some rain,&#8221; he told me, and after a moment I laughed.</p>
<p>That was how I met him.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/2010/11/25/advection/" target="_blank">Read more&#8230;</a></p>
<p><span id="more-1522"></span>#</p>
<p>It was nearly the end of year when I walked past the upper-class apartments and saw the plant in the garbage.</p>
<p>My heart leapt into my throat, and I checked to see if a cop was recording me, because nobody just left a clipping on the street. But besides the tram down the street full of commuters, there was nobody.</p>
<p>I knelt and stared at the glossy tops, the browned underside where it was drying out, the pale hairs on the stem. Even from this distance the smell was overwhelming, wet and clean, and without caring if the cops were watching I scooped it up and dropped it into the back of my hood where it would be safest from the sun.</p>
<p>The tram home was endless; I felt the stem pressing against my neck and shivered.</p>
<p>Half a day&#8217;s water ration went into a glass bowl, and I looked up what plant it was (jade) and how much water it would need (hardly any. It was a survivor).</p>
<p>I sat up all night watching the pattern of leaves on the walls. I expected it to die; I cried like I&#8217;d already lost it, ended up dehydrated from tears and lack of water.</p>
<p>When Fortuni walked with me after school the next day I didn&#8217;t ask why. I was making up my mind to show him the plant. My heart raced. He could turn me in. I didn&#8217;t really know him. It was too dangerous. I couldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come with me,&#8221; I said, and he got in the tram without asking why.</p>
<p>Even before I opened the door I hadn&#8217;t wondered why he walked me home, and when he smiled at the plant and said, &#8220;Beautiful,&#8221; I knew.</p>
<p>He wasn&#8217;t a Level Two. Everybody else was a fool.</p>
<p>He lifted his hand to the glass, closed his eyes over the black shields. He smiled like he knew he looked silly, or like the plant told him a joke.</p>
<p>&#8220;The water is cool,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I keep it under my bed at night.&#8221;</p>
<p>He opened one eye, grinned at me. &#8220;Hiding it from your parents or trying for condensation?&#8221;</p>
<p>After a moment he took his hand off the glass and went home without another word.</p>
<p>The next day he messaged: <em>How is it? Dream about it?</em></p>
<p><em>Stronger</em>, I messaged back, didn&#8217;t tell him what I dreamed.</p>
<p>At school we didn&#8217;t talk about it—we didn&#8217;t talk at all, because I had to work to pass exams, and he had to work to avoid tripping over girls who couldn&#8217;t get enough of his bone-white skin and his blue cuff.</p>
<p>Kay ignored him. She sat one row in front of him in classes, and when he asked her a question she turned just enough to give him her profile, answered him curtly, turned back.</p>
<p>&#8220;This winter I&#8217;m going to my uncle&#8217;s farm,&#8221; she told Carol. &#8220;He&#8217;s scheduled an Atmo so we can get rain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, wow,&#8221; breathed Carol.</p>
<p>My pen snapped, and I had to wait until end of class to get another one.</p>
<p>Mr. Xi talked about the Reclaimers and the class got into a screaming match about whether they were terrorists or guerrillas. They yelled about the cave communities who harbored the sleeper cells; about whether wild rain was even a good idea any more.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a waste of water,&#8221; said Janik, and I wanted to kick him.</p>
<p>When I looked over at Fortuni, he was gazing unblinking ahead of him, his eyes fixed on the knot of hair at the nape of Kay&#8217;s neck, on her pale hand writing.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t hear the rest of the class.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Fortuni messaged: <em>What do you think of Kay?</em></p>
<p><em>I don&#8217;t.</em></p>
<p><em>Try.</em></p>
<p>The plant was outgrowing the bowl, and I adjusted the stem, didn&#8217;t get around to answering him.</p>
<p>The next day in geohistory Mr. Xi talked about Free Water, about the cave-towns authorized to collect condensation without reporting. The class got into it again about Reclaimers seeking asylum there.</p>
<p>I looked at the cliffs and thought how they were underwater once, about vegetation breathing into the sky, about water so big you couldn&#8217;t see the end of it, about the wet slide of rain across skin.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s weird when you miss rain you&#8217;ve never felt,&#8221; Fortuni said, like I&#8217;d spoken, and my fingers went cold.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>He looked back at Kay, who had turned a little towards him as if by accident, resting a white hand on her throat.</p>
<p>When I got home he&#8217;d messaged me. <em>Clip it.</em></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t think about Fortuni when the side-by-side clippings grew so fast; all I knew was my dreams filled with the creaky, quiet sound of growing.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Summer. The last day of fifth year Fortuni wasn&#8217;t there. I didn&#8217;t really think about it (he was Level Zero) except that Kay looked nervous, and it worried me that if something was wrong with Fortuni, Kay knew more than I did.</p>
<p>I stopped her as she was walking back to her seat with her certificate, said, &#8220;Have you seen—&#8221;</p>
<p>She pulled away from me like she was poisoned.</p>
<p>Carol laughed, and I hoped she had to marry Janick Duranti.</p>
<p>On the tram on the way home someone came up behind me, said in my ear, &#8220;Figured out rain yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Fortuni&#8217;s voice, and I was so relieved that I must have really been worried before.</p>
<p>I turned, but he was wearing a black UV hood and I couldn&#8217;t see his face. It had a white bird outline on the side, and as I tried to find his profile behind the hood the silhouette took flight, wings beating.</p>
<p>My hood was from the bargain market, standard SPF 150 striped brown and purple, and I&#8217;d never wanted to be rich so much in my life.</p>
<p>&#8220;You weren&#8217;t in class,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Tapped for Level Zero?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at me like he couldn&#8217;t help it, and for the first time I thought that maybe I&#8217;d managed to surprise him. &#8220;You think I&#8217;m special?&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t answer that, and he grinned, shrugged. &#8220;Yeah, I wish. Just got held up with something.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the rest of the tram ride he looked out the window, and I watched the bird flying on the taut black fabric between two of the ribs; when he put his hood back, the bird would disappear into the folds. It seemed really sad. I don&#8217;t know why.</p>
<p>At my stop, I got off without asking him to follow me, and he took one step and changed his mind, gave me a half-wave as the tram pulled away from the stop and back onto the street.</p>
<p>At home I slid it out from under my bed so it could breathe for an hour. It was big enough to be illegal; I was a criminal.</p>
<p>I messaged him. <em>You should see it.</em></p>
<p>The words sat on my screen, and he didn&#8217;t answer.</p>
<p>Autumn. One of the big government offices was hiring, and I got my credentials and made coffee and shuttled lunches and watched sixth-years plan trajectories and irrigation patterns and wildlife preservation.</p>
<p>I made sure my plant had enough water.</p>
<p>Winter. The dreams about Niagara Cliffs and the water cycle never stopped, and I applied for a sixth year without telling anyone.</p>
<p>Spring. I went into one of the banks in my nice suit and folded back the expensive UV hood I borrowed from a nice sixth-year at the office, and arranged to go into a decade of debt for a year of Meteohydronics and a chance at a seat on an Atmo. My parents were surprised.</p>
<p>Summer. It was too big for the bowl, and I had to leave clippings on the sill with the shade cracked, five minutes at a time until the sun shriveled them and they were dry enough to burn.</p>
<p>A message came back from Fortuni.</p>
<p><em>Want to go to a concert?<br />
</em><br />
It had been a year.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>As I waited outside the back entrance of Roseland I couldn&#8217;t think of anything but Fortuni&#8217;s UV hood, black with a white bird silhouette that flew in place as you watched. I pressed against the grimy brick to avoid the swells of tourists sweating in their &#8220;NYC&#8221; rental hoods, and my breath fluttered in my chest as I looked for Fortuni in a sea of strangers. My hands were clammy.</p>
<p>When I saw him, bouncing along next to that little white bird was Kay&#8217;s pale blue hood with her coat of arms on each side—two greyhounds and a pile of helmets and swords. Kay must have just finished her sixth year, because as the crowd parted for her (crowds always did) I could see she carried nothing except a smug expression.</p>
<p>I sucked in a sigh, and felt dust coating the inside of my mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sarah, hi!&#8221; Kay stepped under the marquee and pushed back the hood, shook out her long blonde hair. She&#8217;d gotten a grey wash in between exams—the latest thing to make you look paler.</p>
<p>I made fists in my pockets.</p>
<p>When Fortuni pushed his hood back, the white bird spread its wings into the folds. &#8220;Did we keep you waiting?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; said Kay. &#8220;She doesn&#8217;t have to worry about studying any more.&#8221; She grinned. &#8220;You must be so relieved that&#8217;s all over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We should go inside,&#8221; said Fortuni, and opened the back door. For a moment Kay looked disgusted by the shabby welcome, but she went. It was Fortuni, after all.</p>
<p>Music was already throbbing as we approached the bar, and Kay gave Fortuni a look of delight. Her hood was too big for her; folded down against her back it made her look like a crested lizard.</p>
<p>She brought him a glass. He passed it to me, and she had to go back for another one and look like it didn&#8217;t bother her.</p>
<p>&#8220;This band is totally derivative,&#8221; she told Fortuni, who had hung back with me.</p>
<p>He shrugged. &#8220;It&#8217;s the opening act. I didn&#8217;t pay much attention to the bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was just like Fortuni to go to a concert without even knowing what band it was, and so I didn&#8217;t think much of it. He just liked to stand in the crowd, eyes closed, feeling the breath of two hundred people.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never felt lonelier than when I was standing next to Fortuni in a crowd.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I figured you had better taste than that. I hear Hammond is amazing.&#8221; Kay swung back and forth between baiting and appeasing Fortuni so quickly I thought she&#8217;d get whiplash.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can hear anything around that stupid hood,&#8221; I said under my breath.</p>
<p>Fortuni smiled into his glass, and his laugh, if he laughed, was drowned out by screams and applause.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Kay flirted with the bartender through two more free drinks, glancing backs at Fortuni to make sure it was all right.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve applied for a sixth year,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He knew it the way he knew everything, and I didn&#8217;t bother to answer him. I&#8217;d requested a year in Meteohydronics.</p>
<p>The study of rain.</p>
<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; I said, &#8220;are you and Kay dating?&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled, still not looking at me. &#8220;Nah. We just talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought about green leaves spilling over the edge of the bowl. &#8220;What about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has ambition,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not something you run across often.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ambition was her as the pretty shadow of some boy, and I saw that ambition all the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really feel like a concert.&#8221; I pressed my drink into his hand. &#8220;I need to study. See you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, stepped forward. &#8220;Please, stay. Please.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had his hand on my arm, the first time he&#8217;d ever touched me. I looked up and could see past the eyeshields into green, frightened eyes.</p>
<p>He&#8217;d never asked me for anything, not one thing that whole silent year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>He smiled as if he&#8217;d never doubted, and I wondered if I&#8217;d just imagined that I could see through him.</p>
<p>Kay materialized at his side, smiling, but her hand was wrapped around her glass so hard that the skin under her nails was red. &#8220;Sorry,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Am I interrupting? Hammond was announced, but if you want to be alone&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortuni dropped his hand. My arm was cold where he&#8217;d touched it.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>The band was loud, and when Fortuni leaned over and spoke he had to repeat himself, louder, before I heard him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come with me,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>My heart constricted. &#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You and Kay,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Come with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>He half-smiled. &#8220;To engineer some rain.&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought, Reclaimers, but didn&#8217;t dare say it.</p>
<p>I thought about his fingers on the glass bowl as he listened to the plant growing, thought maybe he didn&#8217;t even need the Reclaimers to make rain.</p>
<p>My lungs pounded against my ribs. &#8220;Me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you with me for the first wild rain.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why he could still surprise me, but he could; he was a wondrous thing, and back then I was easy to surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Kay?&#8221; I asked, because I was afraid, and it sounded like a spurned child asking.</p>
<p>He said, &#8220;Come with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had signed up for a sixth year. I wanted to work with the Atmos.</p>
<p>I had a plant that would die without me.</p>
<p>In Fortuni&#8217;s black eyes the reflection of the crowd was like wet clouds gathering, like the dream of rain.</p>
<p>The music washed over us, and I was half-dreaming about walking beside Fortuni, walking into some other unknown life that was full of water, and without Kay&#8217;s white bracelet lighting up a warning we wouldn&#8217;t have known the police were coming.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Kay moved first (she must have been used to getting out of something right before the cops got in), and shoved us towards the stairs, shouting something that was drowned out by the drums and the bass. As much as I distrusted her I ran, and beside me Fortuni ran, too.</p>
<p>When we took the turn on the landing I caught a glimpse of her in the crowd, swaying to the music like she didn&#8217;t know us at all.</p>
<p>At the top of the stairs I saw the EXIT sign and ducked into the utility hall pulling Fortuni behind me; he crouched and slid along the wall, and I followed his lead.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not after your plant,&#8221; he said, which was the first time I thought they might have been.</p>
<p>&#8220;What were you doing all year?&#8221; I imagined him in a cave, drinking condensation, blowing up reservoirs, blowing up Atmos with people like me in them. My voice shook.</p>
<p>He turned and grinned. &#8220;Engineering some rain,&#8221; he said, and as we heard footsteps echoing in the stairwell he held out a hand, said, &#8220;Come with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>We couldn&#8217;t make it to the fire exit before the cops got there, and he was holding out his hand, and I didn&#8217;t understand what he was saying, what he was.</p>
<p>I hesitated, shook my head.</p>
<p>He turned and ducked into the door on his right; I saw a cluster of rooms before the door swung shut behind him.</p>
<p>As I moved to follow, the cops swarmed me.</p>
<p>They weren&#8217;t all cops, some of them were kids drinking over-ration who got spooked and bolted, but it felt like a sea of uniforms and I covered my head to protect myself from the kicks, and I let myself be yanked up and handcuffed, listened for Fortuni to make his big escape.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t. They stormed the dressing room (I bit my lips until they bled), someone shouted, the bang of a gunshot.</p>
<p>They had to drag me out by the cuffs because I was trying to run into the room, to see what had happened, to see them carry out his body.</p>
<p>I heard, &#8220;—nothing left!&#8221; just before the door swung shut and they yanked me down the stairs.</p>
<p>I thought of the little white bird, of the folds in his hood, how something could be so neatly tucked away. I stumbled. My eyes burned.</p>
<p>Kay was outside, talking to the cop with the most brass on. As I walked past them, Kay laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her? Oh please. No way she&#8217;s over ration. Can&#8217;t afford anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Kay stared at me like I knew something she didn&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>I knew he had gone into the dressing room, and there was one shot—but maybe he was out by then, maybe he ran, he looked like a sprinter—and he would have run with me, taken me with him, but there was the shot, but even when his hood was folded back, and even when you couldn&#8217;t see it the little white bird was flying away and away and away.</p>
<p>He would have taken me with him.</p>
<p>Kay looked sick and turned away, and I wondered if he had leaned in over the music and asked her to come with him, too.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>They still play music there, not that anybody can get tickets unless they&#8217;re willing to sit under the stage, and when my big brother did that for Goblin Dust he almost failed his service physical six weeks later because he couldn&#8217;t hear.</p>
<p>The top of the balcony stairs is dark and quiet—everyone goes for the view over the railing, no one even sees the hall behind the utility door. Baby-blue walls, like Kay&#8217;s hood, and two dressing rooms—one an inch deep in grime, makeup mirrors with all but two lights burned out, a pinball table rusted stiff.</p>
<p>The second door opens to a honeycomb of little rooms, cloth tacked to the walls, carpet crunching underfoot.</p>
<p>If there was ever an escape it&#8217;s not there now, and I ram the walls until my shoulder wrenches in the socket, tear down the fabric and check for hidden doors, and I fall to my knees and drag my fingers along the floor looking for a crack that will open the way.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>You have to apply at the Embassy to see anyone privately, even if you can recognize Ambassador Arnaun&#8217;s crest in a sea of hoods, even if his daughter called the cops off you.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a paper form, and if it&#8217;s not the Ambassador you want to see, then you write the person&#8217;s name in a little box underneath, and in the box below that you fill out the reason for your visit.</p>
<p>I write, <em>Accepted into sixth year. Advice?</em></p>
<p>A guard directs me to the proper line, and I stand between Visas and Water Permits, and some woman stamps my paper and tells me to look for a response in my email.</p>
<p>It takes six weeks, and then the image of my form is sent back so I can see that under ENTERED it has been stamped DECLINED.</p>
<p>I end up looking up the social calendar for her kind of people, and a week later I find her outside a club, smoking, bare-armed in the cold to show off the big white smoking permit on her wrist.</p>
<p>When she sees me she licks her lips, turns her profile to me like she used to do with Fortuni.</p>
<p>&#8220;Declined,&#8221; she says when I&#8217;m close enough. &#8220;Have they not gotten to long words in sixth year yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>I say, &#8220;Do you know where he is?&#8221; which I mean to say, and &#8220;I miss him,&#8221; which I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>She says, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know, do I?&#8221; which I expect, and bursts into tears, which I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I go home and look up her life until then, little mentions on the society sites and on the galleries of the most fashionable people, and I feel like I&#8217;m checking up on someone I used to babysit.</p>
<p>I get another message from the Embassy, which I expect, and accept the invitation, which I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>At night I pull the bowl out from under my bed and press my hands to the glass, feel with my palms for the voices of living things. When I sit back, the beads are already condensing, two handprints full of water.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to engineer some rain,&#8221; he told me, and I dream of him standing on the dry seabed, closing his eyes over black shields, spreading his arms, opening the sky.</p>

Advection
By Genevieve Valentine

The first day of fifth year a boy came in with the new eyeshields, a glossy expanse of black with no iris or pupil, and looking at him was like looking into an eclipse.

All the other girls said it made them uncomfortable; they teased him to take them out, to put on some normal sunglasses like everyone else. They said they'd never forgive him for hiding eyes in such a handsome face.

"Fortuni, it's a little much," said someone.

That was how I learned his name.

We were all Level Two intelligence, but before the first week was over the news was out that some had managed to find the money for a sixth year. Janik Duranti, who spent the history lectures drawing stick figures screwing on his computer screen, was getting a sixth year. I'd be cleaning his office someday. Answering his phones. Updating the registration on his blue ID cuff.

Carol Clarke opened the top button on her shirt as soon as the shades went down; obvious, but it was worth it to be married to a guy who had a sixth year.

The first time Fortuni opened his mouth was two weeks after start-of-year in geohistory, when Mr. Xi was talking about the five oceans.

"After the emergency desalinization," Mr. Xi said, "we held the first HydroSummit to determine the best use of resources."

"I think it's awful about the dolphins that died," said Kay, whose water ration was unlimited because her father was a diplomat, and that was how I first noticed her.

Mr. Xi opened the rain cycle diagram on our screens; the blue advection loop from a hundred years ago had been overlaid by a three-point process from the Atmo water collectors to the thirsty ground, and the green web of the surface sweat system that preserved the little underground things that managed to survive.

My grandfather sent my mom a postcard from Niagara Cliffs when there was still a river at the bottom (RAIN! All my love, Dad), and as Mr. Xi talked about desalinization I traced the advection circle, thought about the sky filling with wet clouds, about water sliding over everything.

I looked up, and Fortuni was watching me, his lashes casting shadows over his flat black eyes.

"I'm going to engineer some rain," he told me, and after a moment I laughed.

That was how I met him.

It was nearly the end of year when I walked past the upper-class apartments and saw the plant in the garbage.

My heart leapt into my throat, and I checked to see if a cop was recording me, because nobody just left a clipping on the street. But besides the tram down the street full of commuters, there was nobody.

I knelt and stared at the glossy tops, the browned underside where it was drying out, the pale hairs on the stem. Even from this distance the smell was overwhelming, wet and clean, and without caring if the cops were watching I scooped it up and dropped it into the back of my hood where it would be safest from the sun.

The tram home was endless; I felt the stem pressing against my neck and shivered.

Half a day's water ration went into a glass bowl, and I looked up what plant it was (jade) and how much water it would need (hardly any. It was a survivor).

I sat up all night watching the pattern of leaves on the walls. I expected it to die; I cried like I'd already lost it, ended up dehydrated from tears and lack of water.

When Fortuni walked with me after school the next day I didn't ask why. I was making up my mind to show him the plant. My heart raced. He could turn me in. I didn't really know him. It was too dangerous. I couldn't.

"Come with me," I said, and he got in the tram without asking why.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, you like <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)" target="_blank">The Walking Dead</a></em>, huh? It&#8217;s neat, right? An ongoing post-apocalyptic TV series about zombies, based on an award-winning comic. What&#8217;s not to love? And fortunately, they&#8217;ve done a mighty fine job on the adaptation. This viewer is pleased. Zombies are popular at the moment, cresting at the top of one of those unpredictable waves of fashion. <em>The Walking Dead</em> has come at exactly the right time, whether by design or accident, and all power to it.</p>
<p>But this series fits into another genre, that of the post-apocalyptic. And this is where I have a confession to make.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like post-apocalyptic. Post-apocalyptic is predictable, formulaic, and easy. There, I&#8217;ve said it.</p>
<p>This is, of course, not true. Post-apocalyptic is also hugely popular and always has been, not just with the general public but with discerning genre fans like you and I. It seems that wiping out humanity in some global catastrophe is something that, maybe, we all secretly wish for. I mean, if we were among the lucky survivors, it&#8217;d be free reign, right? No work, no more need for money. No more cruelty and tyranny, no more pollution, overpopulation or war.</p>
<p>And of course no people, no family, no friends, no loved ones, and the beginning of a huge struggle for survival against impossible odds in a situation likely to psychologically traumatise even the most hardened survivalist.</p>
<p>So okay, not so neat.</p>
<p>I said I don&#8217;t like post-apocalyptic, and that bit <em>is</em> true. Post-apocalyptic is formulaic, simply because the scale of the situation is such that any fiction set after the disaster must follow similar plot lines. The survivors are isolated, and then eventually find each other. Cities are empty or full of the dead (or the walking dead). There is no power, no medicine. Every manmade resource is suddenly very finite indeed. And so on, and so on. Plotwise, most post-apocalyptic stories are more or less the same.</p>
<p>I should point out here that I&#8217;m no expert. I have friends who are very dedicated followers of end-of-the-world stories, and no doubt about now they&#8217;re ready to put their keyboards through the computer screen in frustration. But hear me out. Post-apocalyptic may suck, plotwise, but where it really shines is in characterisation. Possibly more than any other genre, post-apocalyptic depends upon strong characterisation. Because if all the plots are the same, or similar (and I&#8217;m talking pure plot here, which is different to story and situation), then all you have left are the survivors. And it is how the survivors act in their new environment that makes the story. I&#8217;m not saying that characterisation is unique to the post-apocalypse, far from it, but I am saying that if you&#8217;re about to write an epic tale of an empty world, you&#8217;ve got to be prepared to engage the reader with some very, very powerful players.</p>
<p>With that in mind, and as a self-confessed post-apocalyptic skeptic, here&#8217;s my list of five tales that, to me, are among the best examples of the post-apocalyptic. I&#8217;m not just going to regurgitate a list from Wikipedia (and, my heavens, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction" target="_blank">there is quite a list on there</a>), these are personal choices that I think are either great examples of either characterisation or perhaps an unusual or uncommon take on the post-apocalyptic plot. Having just slated the genre for being formulaic, let&#8217;s see if there are any stories which break the mould.</p>
<p>Before I continue, there&#8217;s also an important distinction to make here between those stories which are genuinely post-apocalyptic, and those which are really apocalyptic. Post-apocalypse, by definition, implies that the menace, threat, disaster, alien invasion, plague, etc, have been and gone. What we are left with is the world and the people left afterwards. Stories like the recent film <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyline_(film)" target="_blank">Skyline</a></em>, or <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_(film)">2012</a></em>, or great classics like <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_worlds" target="_blank">The War of the Worlds</a></em> take place while the disaster is unfolding. While the aftermath may be considered post-apocalyptic (although probably not in the case of <em>The War of the Worlds</em>), we don&#8217;t see that bit. I&#8217;ll admit here I&#8217;m going to cheat on one entry in my list below, but only because I think it&#8217;s a particularly fine and relatively unknown example.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Quiet Earth</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em></em></strong><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/earth.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1511" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/earth.jpg" alt="" width="547" height="393" /></a><br />
I&#8217;m really sure how well known New Zealand cinema of the early 80s is outside of that country, but <a href="http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/the-quiet-earth-1986-859" target="_blank"><em>The Quiet Earth</em></a> is well worth tracking down. It tells the story of a man who wakes up one morning to find the world empty − whatever the apocalypse was (I shall reveal nothing), it actually physically removed the world&#8217;s population, so our hero (played by the wonderful <a href="http://www.nzonscreen.com/person/bruno-lawrence" target="_blank">Bruno Lawrence</a>) finds himself genuinely alone. With a completely deserted Earth, not even a single corpse in sight, Lawrence carries the majority of the film on his own. It&#8217;s a remarkable performance as his character goes from confusion, to exhilaration (with nobody around the world is his oyster&#8230; if he wants to drive a giant earthmover through a gas station to see what happens, why not?) and finally to total paranoia and delusion. And after all, if you were the only human being left on the planet, wouldn&#8217;t you start to think you were special? <em>The Quiet Earth</em> is out on DVD and I&#8217;d recommend you grab it.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Stand</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em></em></strong><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/The_Stand_cover.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1513" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/The_Stand_cover.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="300" /></a><br />
The grand-daddy of all post-apocalyptic stories, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stand" target="_blank">Stephen King&#8217;s 1978</a> tale of the survivors of a super flu which wipes out most of the human population is rightly considered a classic. At an eye-watering 1300 pages, this book is a perfect example of character over plot. Of course, King is known for this, but while the concept of a superflu (one engineered by the military as a biological weapon that is released accidentally) was old hat when King wrote it, the journey of the survivors as they find each other and come to terms with their new world is brilliant. Although the central plot eventually reveals itself − that of the survivor&#8217;s journey to Las Vegas to make their stand against an evil that has arisen − how the characters react and cope is what makes this whopping tome a real page-turner. If you haven&#8217;t read any King, this wouldn&#8217;t be a bad place to start. Afficiandos think that this is his best work; while I personally prefer <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem's_Lot" target="_blank">&#8216;Salem&#8217;s Lot</a></em>, if you have any doubts about the post-apocalyptic genre, this will set your mind at rest, as it did mine.</p>
<p><strong><em>Earth Abides</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em></em></strong><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/eartha.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1515" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/eartha.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="300" /></a><br />
Twenty-nine years before <em>The Stand</em> was published, academic George R. Stewart wrote his single novel which might be called &#8220;genre&#8221;. <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Abides" target="_blank">Earth Abides</a></em> is another that follows the standard post-apocalyptic formula − a super-sickness kills everyone, leaving only those immune to the disease alive − but you can forgive Stewart for this given that it was probably a newer story concept back in the 1940s. <em>Earth Abides</em> might be that one book that I&#8217;d take to a desert island, should I be so abandoned. It&#8217;s beautiful, moving and sad, and sticks in the mind not just because of the human characters and their journey but because of Stewart&#8217;s depiction of the world itself. In <em>Earth Abides</em>, the Earth itself is a character. Rid of destructive humans, it begins to regenerate, reclaiming itself and returning to an earlier pre-industrial (you might even say &#8216;default&#8217;) state. Stewart conveys this in a striking way, with a key motif being the silence of the world. Without humans and their cars, planes, factories and technology, the Earth is mostly silent, the loudest sound being that of a thunderclap. In this quiet Earth, the survivors gather and attempt to reconstruct society but ultimately they fail, instead regressing to a more primitive level of society. This only reinforces the central theme of the book. The Earth abides; humanity does not.</p>
<p><strong>The Road</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ctroad.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1518" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ctroad.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="362" /></a><br />
</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m cheating here. I&#8217;m not talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road" target="_blank">Cormac McCarthy&#8217;s Pulitzer Prize-winning post-apocalyptic novel</a>, one which dominated the responses on Twitter when I put out a call for recommendations. I&#8217;m talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatermass" target="_blank">Quatermass</a> creator and master of British science fiction <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatermass" target="_blank">Nigel Kneale</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362094/" target="_blank">one-off BBC television drama from 1963</a>, now sadly lost from the archives and only surviving in script form plus, it seems, one manky photo. Also, it&#8217;s not really post-apocalyptic. In fact, it is really<em> pre-apocalyptic</em>. In the 18th century, the inhabitants of an English village shun the road that runs through the nearby woods, for the woods are haunted and people have heard terrible things. As the story reaches the climax, it is revealed that the manifestations on the road are the echo of people fleeing an atomic explosion in the present day, somehow riverberating back in time. The juxtaposition of modern − police sirens, recognisably modern people running in abject terror for their lives − with the old, with the 18th century characters cowering in terror, completely unable to comprehend the sound which we, the viewer, recognise all too well, must have been both brilliant and chilling when it was first shown.</p>
<p><strong><em>Survivors</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em></em></strong><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/survivores.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1517" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/survivores.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a><br />
I can&#8217;t make this list, self-confessed archive television nut that I am, without mentioning Terry Nation&#8217;s BBC TV series,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivors" target="_blank"> <em>Survivors</em></a>. Again, the scenario is pure post-apocalypse cliche. Humanity is mostly wiped out by a plague, strongly implied to be deliberately engineered and released by accident. Over three seasons between 1975 and 1979, <em>Survivors</em> charted the journey of the survivors as they found each other and ultimately formed a community. Critics often bemoan the transformation from gritty science fiction survival story to &#8220;soap opera&#8221;, but I think they&#8217;re confusing soap opera with character-driven drama, and this is where Survivors shows its real strength (characterisation, see?). <em>Survivors</em> was remade for a modern audience over two seasons in 2008 and 2010, but here the tired nature of the premise was in full effect, rendering the remake flat and pointless. <em>Survivors</em> should be experienced in all its 70s glory.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Dalek Invasion of Earth</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/invasion.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1519" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/invasion.jpg" alt="" width="504" height="314" /></a><br />
</em></strong></p>
<p>A sixth entry, mainly because Nigel Kneale&#8217;s <em>The Road</em> doesn&#8217;t quite count. <em>The Dalek Invasion of Earth</em> was the second appearance of the Daleks in <em>Doctor Who</em>, and was broadcast in six episodes from November 21 to December 26, 1964. Despite the title, this isn&#8217;t about an alien invasion. By the time the Doctor and company arrive in a deserted, dilapidated London, the Daleks have been the masters of the Earth for a decade or more. Here we discover that the Daleks first employed a virus to weaken society before arriving in force, and years late the surviving humans are either enslaved or gathered in disparate resistance groups.</p>
<p><em>The Dalek Invasion of Earth</em> is <em>Doctor Who</em>&#8216;s first foray into alien invasion and one of the rare occasions it featured a genuinely post-apocalyptic story. Extensive location work around London makes this story something of a small-screen epic, and to this day it is regarded as one of the best stories of the show&#8217;s early years.</p>
<p>There are many more that are worth of this list − as already mentioned, <em>The Road</em> by Cormac McCarthy, but also <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall-e" target="_blank">Wall-E</a></em>, <em><a href="http://theclockworkcentury.com/" target="_blank">Boneshaker</a></em> by Cherie Priest (perhaps a rare example of post-apocalyptic confined to a very specific place, namely the walled city of Seattle). UK genre publisher <a href="http://www.abaddonbooks.com/" target="_blank">Abaddon</a> has a entire ongoing post-apocalyptic series, <em><a href="http://www.abaddonbooks.com/titles/" target="_blank">The Afterblight Chronicles</a></em>, which are well worth checking out. Like I said I&#8217;m not post-apocalyptic scholar so please, nominate your own prime examples of the genre in the comments and teach me a lesson.</p>
<p>Now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I have the next episode of <em>The Walking Dead</em> to watch.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Have you written a story about The Timely Issue Of The Day? Will it still be timely by the time it's published? A writer can only hope.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About two years ago, I was flying with my family and I noticed that, when we landed, all I could hear was the sound of everyone’s cell phone booting up.</p>
<p>A month later, I had a 9000-word short-story about airport security. Taking place about 50 years in the future, it’s about a man traveling to Los Angeles to see his daughter and the rigmarole he has to go through.</p>
<p>It has yet to sell. I’ve cut down the word count, I’ve revised several times, I’ve sent it to a couple dozen publications… and no dice. No one seems to want it. (It almost made it to the top at <em>Andromeda Spaceways</em>, and the readers gave me good feedback, but they didn’t publish it.) I’m pretty sure it’s not getting bought because nothing actually <em>happens</em> &#8212; a man flies to Los Angeles to see his daughter – and editors I guess want stories where there’s action.</p>
<p>But that’s neither here nor there. Not at the moment.</p>
<p>Last Monday, as I sat at my desk at work watching post after post about <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater”">security theater</a> pass by on Tweetdeck, I felt a little spark of hope that my story might soon find a home.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it often takes months for stories to get from the slush pile to the editorial desk.</p>
<p>I understand that. I really do. And I’m very patient – I follow the submission guidelines to the best of my ability, I never bother editors unless the official response time has passed by more than a full week, and I don’t complain about form rejections. The reality of writing is that there’s a metric buttload of us and a relatively small number of editors and markets.</p>
<p>Still, now that I’ve exhausted most of the long-story markets, it’s going to be harder for me to find a home for my story. I predict a long couple of nights of rewriting, followed by sending out the story… and waiting.</p>
<p>And waiting.</p>
<p>And waiting.</p>
<p>Just like every other burgeoning author.</p>
<p>Thing is, by the time my story gets to the top of the slush pile, the timeliness of it will probably be moot. All this hullabaloo about scanners that <a href="//boingboing.net/2010/01/22/naked-airport-scanne.html”">don’t detect bombs in body cavities</a>, <a href="//gizmodo.com/5689759/tsa-full+body-scanners-protecting-passengers-or-padding-pockets”">scanners that show screeners your naked body</a>, <a href="//lifehacker.com/5690402/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-tsa-screenings-and-gropings”">fines being levied against people who refuse to be body-scanned</a> and don’t want your hands on their junk… it’ll all be over in three, six, nine, or 12 months (or whenever the story eventually is read by an editor who wants it). Then it’ll be another three to 18 months until it actually sees print. At that point, we’ll have moved onto another cause celebre. Twitter will be complaining about the next Apple tablet that doesn’t do That One Thing Everyone Likes, or a politician who said That One Thing Everyone Thought Was Idiotic, or the fact that people without That One Smartphone are technological luddites who don’t deserve to pray at the altars of their mighty cellphone providers.</p>
<p>I’m okay with that. I really am. But it makes me wonder if I should mention in my cover letter that I wrote the story in response to airline security woes. Usually my cover letters are very simple: here is my story, I hope you like it and choose to publish it, thank you. (Soon they will include the location of my first professional publication, but until I have a contract in hand I’m not revealing it to a wider audience.) Would saying why I wrote a story help much? Would it give the slush reader the impetus to nudge it a little higher in the “stories for the editor to read” pile (provided the slush reader likes it enough to pass it on, of course)?</p>
<p>I don’t know. I’m not an editor. But I do know this: regardless of what happens with the story I’ve just been blogging about, I’m going to keep writing timely fiction, and if it gets published too late… well, I don’t think I’ll care, because it <em>will</em> get published.</p>
<p>Eventually.</p>

<p><strong>PLANETFALL</strong><br />
by Michael C. Lea</p>
<p>Galthas Talisar stepped out from the buzzing chaos of the transportal and onto lush greenery.  This world was alien, to be sure, but the patterns were almost familiar.  The ship&#8217;s oracles had chosen well.</p>
<p>Behind him, the transportal hummed again.  An armored leg emerged and carefully found its footing on the blue-green ferns carpeting the jungle floor.  More than twenty thousand miles above, the leg&#8217;s owner shifted his weight and stepped fully through an identical transportal, instantly emerging on the planet&#8217;s surface below.</p>
<p>That cautious step belonged to Urjik, who could be called cautious in few other ways.  In fact, his reputation had left him few other options for a willing partner on this mission.  Urjik did not care. He and Galthas had fought together against the worst the Zayeen had to offer.  He trusted Galthas implicitly, despite his disdain for the other scrawny ascetics from Signet Battalion.</p>
<p>Urjik&#8217;s greenish skin and jutting lower canines marked him as a charuk, his bloodline tainted by nether influences.  Despite this stigma, and despite his temper, he had risen quickly in Rampart Battalion.  Even the most burdensome battlesuit did not slow him, and no one was a truer shot with an inferno cannon or a hex-impelled railgun.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/2010/11/18/planetfall/">Read More&#8230;</a><br />
<span id="more-1493"></span></p>
<p>Galthas, by contrast, had the pale skin and slight build of the feytouched.  Unarmored and with no visible arms, he was nowhere near as physically imposing as Urjik.  Those who had seen Signet Battalion in action, however, knew that his bulky cold-iron armbands were weapons as formidable as any firearm or battleaxe, and far more versatile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Air&#8217;s a little thick,&#8221; Urjik said, &#8220;but it breathes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could have told you that,&#8221; Galthas replied softly, &#8220;since you insisted I go first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Urjik flashed a tusky grin.  &#8220;I thought that was protocol,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I always follow protocol.&#8221;</p>
<p>Galthas frowned back over his shoulder at the armored charuk, but said nothing.  His companion was irrepressible, but Galthas had not quite recovered the use of his sense of humor yet.  It was one more thing the Zayeen had taken.  Perhaps here, on this world, they could find themselves again.</p>
<p>The transportal winked out behind them, the thaumaturgic sigil in its keystone deactivated from the other side.  No one else would be coming through.  For such a vital mission there would ordinarily be at least a full squadron, with clockwork or golems for logistical support. Here, as on dozens of other mission sites, there were only resources for a two-man team.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which way is it?&#8221; Urjik asked, looking around warily.  The air was warm and humid, and buzzed with strange insects like fat blue bees.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should be within twenty meters,&#8221; Galthas said.  &#8220;This way, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>They moved through the brush, Galthas sliding quietly, Urjik with the subtlety of a tank.  His armor&#8217;s servos whined as he plowed through flora and fauna alike.  The cluster of large multicolored crystals jutting from the center of the armor&#8217;s back glowed as the suit drew power from them.</p>
<p>The undergrowth thinned.  A clearing lay just beyond.  They could feel a vibration in the air¸ an indefinable high-energy presence, like a gathering thunderstorm.</p>
<p>Galthas turned back.  &#8220;Ready?&#8221; he asked.  &#8220;Either this is it, or this is something very bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Urjik hefted his high-powered Vindocladian inferno cannon to his shoulder and aimed its sigil-carved barrel into the clearing.  Inside the bulky rifle&#8217;s main housing, a nether imp was caged, writhing in immortal fury but jacketed securely in heavy-duty curse-proofed lead.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of these days that thing&#8217;s going to backfire,&#8221; Galthas said, &#8220;and all your kids will end up with tentacles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Urjik shrugged.  &#8220;They&#8217;re already gonna have tusks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Galthas silently parted the foliage and advanced into the clearing. The source of the disturbance in the air was immediately apparent.  In the center of a small field of yellow-orange flowers, a geyser of light fountained six meters into the air, too bright to look at. Galthas looked down at his armbands.  The fey glyphs carved into them were shining with power.  Behind him, Urjik struggled with his rifle as if fighting recoil; the angry imp inside was soaking up energy. His armor&#8217;s fuel-crystals grew brighter, their flaws and occlusions shining like stars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bespeak the ship,&#8221; Galthas said, his voice heavy with emotion.  &#8220;Tell them the oracles were correct.  Tell them we&#8217;ve found a sourcewell.&#8221; Tell them the lights will stay on and the ships will not starve.  Tell them our world is dying, but our people may yet survive.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Most people on Ashter had heard of the Zayeen before they came roaring out of hyperspace bent on genocide, but few thought much about them. They were frequent trading partners, but casual visits in either direction were rare.  Their world Zayid was rich in certain rare earths and metals, but the people themselves were generally regarded as physically repugnant and culturally backward.</p>
<p>The Zayeen were fanatical servants of a harsh and exacting deity, while the Ashterites practiced a genial animism whose very formlessness offended their rigid neighbors.  In order to secure a vital trade route, the Ashterite military had established a base on Zayid, inadvertently trespassing on one of many holy lands and thus sowing the seeds of their own eventual ruin.</p>
<p>Resentment on Zayid built over generations, until a swift and bloody coup left the Crusader faction in charge.  The first wave of the Holy Zayeen Crusade departed for Ashter within weeks of the coup.  In terms of technology, they were completely outmatched by the Ashterite military, but they brought with them a secret weapon that the Ashterites could never have anticipated.</p>
<p>The Zayeen Crusaders had roused their dark god from its slumber.  It flew alongside them, ringing with righteous fury, eager to descend upon the sinning Ashterites.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>The sourcewell, of course, came with its own complications.  It seemed as if nothing would come easy, ever again.</p>
<p>Galthas and Urjik found out about the aliens immediately after bespeaking the good news back to their ship.  This close to the sourcewell, the bifurcated mimic-daemon in Urjik&#8217;s thaumaturgic squawkbox transmitted powerfully and received clearly.  The mimics were bred to produce conjoined twins, and separated soon after birth. Whatever one perceived, the other repeated, no matter the distance between them.  Although the little daemons lived their entire lives separated, Galthas occasionally wondered if they ever longed for their missing halves.</p>
<p>While Urjik contacted the ship, Galthas sat and meditated on the sourcewell, feeling the fey energies dancing in his armbands.  He sat at the very edge of the grassy clearing, and came no closer to the well itself.  Any sentient being who strayed too close would be entranced, drawn irresistibly into the Source to be annihilated.  The sourcewells were vital, they were the stuff of life itself; but they were also deadly.</p>
<p>Urjik&#8217;s heavy tread had announced his presence long before he spoke. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got company,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;Maybe half a klick away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Galthas reluctantly left meditation behind.  &#8220;Zayeen?&#8221; he asked, eyes still closed.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Urjik said.  &#8220;Something else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before they left, Galthas decided to conceal the sourcewell.  There was no way of knowing how the interlopers might react to it, or try to exploit it.</p>
<p>Galthas fell into a stance, spreading his feet wide.  He flexed his knees, and felt the earth below hold him in its grasp.  He flattened his palms, swung his arms into the ready position, and prepared to carve his will into reality.</p>
<p>His hands moved, weaving glyphs in the air, leaving a shimmering trail hanging in the empty space behind.  Inside the bracers clasped around his forearms, captive fey wildlings shone brightly in response to his will.  Their power flowed through a web of microtubules of cold iron, spinning through complex circuits until it emerged, shaped into signs transcribed from Galthas&#8217; mind onto the face of creation.</p>
<p>Galthas drew a point, a line, a curve, suggesting the sweep of a clock&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>cen(x,y,z):=-45.0892, 207.6823, 32.3342<br />
rad:=20m</em></p>
<p>Next, an oval circumscribed by a circle:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>set perc:=from perc1 to perc5<br />
for all perc from cen(x,y,z) to arc(cen,rad,360)</em></p>
<p>Finally, a Moebius-like closed loop, curving back upon itself, to establish the simple recursion:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>perc:=perc+dist(dist(cen,rad),perc)<br />
next perc</em></p>
<p>The glyphs hung in midair, shimmering.  Galthas waved them together. They joined, overlapping, connecting in the proper places to allow power to flow through the newly-defined system.</p>
<p>Galthas thrust his hands into the glyph, vertically aligned, right over left.  Power crackled through his armbands as they intersected the potent symbol.  He then rotated his arms, as if turning a wheel, until his hands were horizontal.  The glyph rotated with them a full quarter-turn, locking into place with an impact he could feel in the pit of his stomach.  Reality&#8217;s tumblers clicked over one another, and the world was changed.</p>
<p>The sourcewell and its clearing vanished instantly, replaced by more jungle.  Anyone looking in the well&#8217;s direction would not only fail to see it; their steps would be guided subtly around it.  It would be safe from tampering or exploitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; Galthas said, &#8220;let&#8217;s go meet our visitors.&#8221;</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>When the astronomers first spotted it, they thought it was a mistake. It flew alongside the Zayeen fleet, gliding in and out of conventional space, radioactive auroras trailing in its wake in sinister serpentine waves.  When it was too consistent to be labeled a mistake, they thought it was a massive ship, a dreadnought on a scale heretofore never seen.  Even that would have been much better than the truth.</p>
<p>The truth, which they saw once the Zayeen fleet breached visual range, was that it was a <em>Vulcalisk gargantua.</em></p>
<p>As far as the scientists on Ashter knew, no one had ever seen one alive before.  The only known specimen had been discovered near Zayid, by the Ashterite military garrison placed there.  A subsequent joint expedition had fully explored the site in all its awful grandeur.  The beast lay coiled around a shattered planetoid, with the crumbling remains of a world smeared around it as an asteroid belt.  The planetoid was scarred, obviously by the creature&#8217;s external assault, but it seemed to have been shot through with a network of fine holes as well.</p>
<p>There was nothing left of the planet-sized monster but bones.</p>
<p>They had considered it an anomaly, a unique aberration, but they had named the species nonetheless.  It held the popular imagination on Ashter for some time; reconstructions, artistic speculations on what it had looked like alive, and even fictional entertainment featuring the gargantua as destroyer or savior were all eagerly devoured by a captivated public.</p>
<p>But the Zayeen – the Zayeen had insisted it was a god.  They even had their own name for it, terrifying and unpronounceable.  They were rapturous at its discovery and thought the Ashterites&#8217; whimsical fascination filthy and disrespectful.  The Ashterites, for their part, thought the talk of god-bones laughable, but never snickered too loudly or in mixed company.</p>
<p>When the Zayeen emerged from hyperspace with their scaly god behind them, sculling the solar winds with its massive crocodilian tail, the Astherites stopped laughing.  They knew the Zayeen worshipped the beast, but never imagined that the fanatics could find or clone a live one, much less tame it.</p>
<p>The <em>Vulcalisk gargantua</em> tore through their defenses and blotted out the sun, hungry for the hot marrow of Ashter.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>The aliens were &#8220;something else&#8221; indeed.</p>
<p>Their scanners revealed that the ship was like a coffin; a lifeless box of metal, hollowed out, with stubby wings that imitated flying things but were not animated by any sort of life-force.  To Galthas and Urjik, it was like seeing a rock or a corpse that flew.</p>
<p>A door in the ship&#8217;s belly hissed open, powered by some motive force that was not immediately apparent.  The thing that waddled out was tripartite; three arms, three legs, no head to speak of, a ring of watery green eyes around its midsection and a central mouth where its neck should be.  Its flesh was gray and rubbery, with irregular patchy tufts of reddish hair.  It was draped in metallic ornaments, many of which seemed permanently attached.</p>
<p>Galthas and Urjik stood their ground, ready for anything.  Urjik had relegated his cannon to a shoulder mount and now held a telescoping battleaxe that he had unfolded from its housing in his armor. Galthas&#8217; bracers had sprouted shimmering bucklers and stubby blades of fey energy.  Both stood ready for battle at any sign of aggression. They had been caught unawares by the Zayeen.  Never again.</p>
<p>Then the tripod-thing spoke, and a box on its chest echoed its words. Galthas and Urjik both started; they were quite certain that no creature or spirit nested within the box, and a talking cube of metal was unheard of.  Unfortunately, both the tripod and the box spoke gibberish.</p>
<p>The rubbery creature pointed to the box, then to its own mouth, then to Galthas.  When there was no response, it said something unintelligible and repeated the gesture.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think it wants us to talk?&#8221; Urjik asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; Galthas responded.</p>
<p>So they talked.  They spoke of the war.  Urjik talked of the gargantua, of how it wrapped itself around their world and sunk its teeth, with tips as broad as cities, deep into Ashter&#8217;s hide.  He talked of the destruction, or claws that rent continents asunder, of the flight into their great voidfaring ships, living creatures like gigantic levitating horseshoe crabs.</p>
<p>Galthas talked of the desperate fight to slay the gargantua, of witnessing the deaths of hundreds of thaumaturges of Mirror Battalion who died affixing talismans to one of the impossibly huge creature&#8217;s eye-sockets.  He talked of Rampart Battalion&#8217;s heroism as its fighters, Urjik among them, wielded weapons bearing talismans mated to those affixed to the gargantua.  They had fired bolt after bolt of imp-spawned hellfire, projectile after projectile, until their power crystals had all dimmed and their ammunition was exhausted.  Every shot from a thaumaturgically-marked weapon curved in its path and unerringly sought its companion talisman affixed to the gargantua.</p>
<p>They spoke of the evacuation, of how the transportals had burned until the sourcewells sputtered out.  Until the soul of Ashter perished in one final paroxysm as the gargantua spewed the planet&#8217;s lifeblood out into the void.</p>
<p>Urjik spoke fiercely of the gargantua&#8217;s death-throes, of how it locked onto Asher with its tail and all six legs as it perished, curling around their world just as the ancient skeleton had been found curled around a shattered, dead planetoid.  Galthas spoke softly of the decision to flee, of the main fleet leaving Ashter to seek out another homeland, while their still battle-ready companions stayed to try to repulse the remains of the Zayeen fleet.</p>
<p>And then the alien spoke in their language – or at least, its box did. &#8220;Thanks be you for to discuss words,&#8221; the box buzzed out.  &#8220;This one Prime Speaker, Loban Fleet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Galthas and Urjik looked at each other.  The box was a piece of dead metal that learned languages.  They had met other spacefaring races, but this was truly alien.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Galthas, and this is Urjik,&#8221; Galthas said.  &#8220;Of . . . of Ashter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pleased are we of Loban to know you,&#8221; the Prime Speaker said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we . . . you,&#8221; Galthas replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;For how long are you staying this orb?&#8221; the alien asked bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are refugees,&#8221; Galthas said.  &#8220;Our home . . . can no longer support us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Loban Prime Speaker paused.  His large green eyes blinked several times in succession.  Finally, he said, &#8220;We welcome you as competitors in spirit of fair play.&#8221;</p>
<p>Urjik frowned.  Galthas held up a hand to keep him silent and said, &#8220;We hope that, in this time of loss and tragedy, we can count on the assistance and cooperation of the Loban people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We welcome all competitors who wish to contend freely,&#8221; the Prime Speaker said quickly.  &#8220;We seek a resource.  Spotted from high-altitude scan.  Strange light-fountain, high energy, very unusual.  Was here, but now is not.  Seen this resource, have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s talking about the sourcewell, Galthas realized.  Was it possible that these Lobans had advanced all the way to interstellar travel without ever encountering a sourcewell?</p>
<p>Whatever the answer, he knew that he could not risk being cut off from the well.  His entire civilization would collapse without a usable energy source.  This was all they had.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been traveling long,&#8221; Galthas said.  &#8220;We are very tired.  We must return and convey your greetings to our leaders.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Loban blinked several eyes.  Maybe it was the equivalent of a nod. Then it abruptly turned and marched back into its ship.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>That night, they watched Ashter die.  They established visual communication with the ship, intending to report on their encounter with the Loban ship.  But they were confronted instead with their Section Commander, red-faced and puffy-eyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to have to be the one to show you,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you have to see it down there alone.  But we all have to see it.  We all have to watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; Urjik asked, although on some level, they both knew already.</p>
<p>Fresh tears coursed down the Section Commander&#8217;s cheeks.  Neither Galthas nor Urjik had ever seen the man so emotional.  He angrily wiped his face with his forearm.</p>
<p>&#8220;The damn thing was hermaphroditic, or asexual, or the gods only know what,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;We had everyone evacuated, we had the damn Zayeen lizard-troopers on the run, we were on the verge of implementing a plan to pull their big lizard off.  Someday we might have been able to go back.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Section Commander reached for something unseen, and the image hovering above the squawkbox changed to a view of Ashter, wounded but whole.  The corpse of the reptilian gargantua was still twined about the planet.</p>
<p>&#8220;The science boys say the eggs must&#8217;ve been encased in something super-dense, like neutronium,&#8221; the Commander&#8217;s voice said.  &#8220;They can&#8217;t figure out how any egg inside would survive that.  But we know there were two of them, and they passed right through the planet&#8217;s crust like it was water.  When they sank all the way to the core they fused, and . . .&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice broke off.  The image of the damaged planet spun quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we realized what was happening, there were volunteers. Hundreds.  They took all the golems and elementals and all the burrowing clockwork they could scrape together and they went back in to try to stop it.  We weren&#8217;t even sure Ashter would ever be habitable again, but they still went back in.&#8221;</p>
<p>They could hear the Section Commander sobbing.  On the image, something strange was happening to Ashter.  Volcanoes were erupting, so many and so violently that they were visible even when viewing the whole planet.  Chunks of rock, of the planet&#8217;s crust, spewed out into orbit and beyond.  But some of the chunks kept moving.</p>
<p>Some of them . . . were something <em>else</em>.</p>
<p>Creatures were bursting free of the planet&#8217;s crust, miniature versions of the giant lizard whose corpse draped Ashter.  Tiny in comparison to the globe itself, they still must have been as large as cities or larger.  At first just a few, then hundreds, then thousands burrowed free, bursting Ashter from within.  They swooped and dove through the planet&#8217;s remains, swimming through the solar currents and breathing in the quantum fog, devouring promising possibilities and exhaling death.</p>
<p>The planet collapsed, spreading into a bloody arc.  Galthas and Urjik watched as all that was left of their world, everything they had ever known, every place they had ever lived, everything they had ever hoped or longed for or wondered about, every mystery unsolved and every story untold, everything that had ever defined home to them bled out into the vacuum.</p>
<p>As the fragments cooled, the tiny gargantua abandoned them and turned on the corpse of their mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Always wondered what could have picked that thing down to its bones,&#8221; Urjik said, his voice thick.  Galthas turned to rebuke him, but held his tongue when he saw his burly companion&#8217;s face.  The charuk, too, was weeping openly.</p>
<p>Numbly, they made their report and received their orders.  Urjik wanted to attack the Loban ship right away, probably because he felt a deep need to strike back at something.  But he had a point; the sourcewell had to be defended.</p>
<p>Command wanted information, however.  They had quietly tagged the ship thaumaturgically, so it could be monitored from a nearby squawkbox. Scouts had encountered several derelict ships on the outskirts of the system.  If they were Loban ships, the Lobans might be grateful for information about them.</p>
<p>In the end, they were told to continue negotiating, and find out as much as possible without giving away vital information about their forces.  The Ashterites no longer had the resources to squander potential allies.  And while the temptation to inflict pain to still their own disquiet was there, High Command was determined that the remaining people of Ashter would not become like the Zayeen.  They would trust until given a reason to distrust, and seek the good in all beings.</p>
<p>We trusted the Zayeen, Galthas thought, and see where it got us.  But he accepted his orders and prepared for a long, sleepless night.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>The next day the Loban Prime Speaker asked them bluntly about their technology.  The Lobans had been monitoring them, it seemed, and regarded their equipment as strange or somehow sorcerous in nature.</p>
<p>Galthas pretended to not understand.  &#8220;Our devices are based on life, on binding simple spirits to do our will,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Prime Speaker blinked its eyes and fluttered its mouth a bit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are there . . . more of you coming to this world?&#8221; Galthas asked, and immediately winced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Subtle,&#8221; Urjik muttered behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; the Prime Speaker replied.  &#8220;As we said, we seek resources.  This is done in competition, as it should be.  Our location is secret of much seriousness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So the dead ships our scouts have spotted at the edge of this system are not yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Loban waved an arm dismissively.  &#8220;No, no.  Not Loban.  Some other race whose name we do not recall.  They were seeking resources also, quite urgently.  But they did not know this orb was present.  They tried to turn back, make for another system.  Apparently they failed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Galthas felt something cold worm its way through his gut.  &#8220;You knew they were in urgent need of resources?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Loban blinked.  &#8220;Yes, yes.  We communicated with them briefly.  It yielded nothing.  It was of little importance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you direct them to this planet?&#8221; Galthas asked.</p>
<p>The Loban seemed taken aback; it blinked all of its eyes at once, three times.  &#8220;We seek resources,&#8221; it said.  &#8220;This is done in competition.  All must compete for themselves alone, or the competition is impure.  These creatures were not Loban.  This orb was ours, found first by us.  Why would we want more competitors?&#8221;  After a pause, it added, &#8220;Of course, now that you are here, we anticipate striving for resources with you in the spirit of fairness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Galthas said.  He turned to Urjik and said, &#8220;Go back to our camp.  Tell Command the ships they found were not Loban.&#8221;</p>
<p>Urjik looked hesitant.  &#8220;Go,&#8221; Galthas told him, and he did.</p>
<p>Galthas contemplated the strange tripod-like alien.  Based on their brief interaction, he could not say that they might become bloodthirsty fanatics, like the Zayeen.  But they were incredibly indifferent, which might be just as bad.  The Loban&#8217;s lack of compassion for the beings it had allowed to freeze to death was chilling.</p>
<p>He turned back to the Loban Speaker.  &#8220;We accept your generous offer to compete for resources,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;And in return for your magnanimity, I wish to offer you the secret of our technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>When Galthas returned to camp, Urjik was nearly beside himself.  &#8220;The Lobans!&#8221; he said.  &#8220;I pulled &#8216;em up on the box – they got back in their ship and took off!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they, now?&#8221; Galthas asked.</p>
<p>Urjik pointed to the squawkbox.  An image of the Loban ship flying over the countryside hovered over it.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re headed right for the sourcewell!&#8221; Urjik said.  &#8220;But how did they find it again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably because I turned the ward off,&#8221; Galthas said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would you . . .&#8221; Urjik began.  But then he began to put it together, and fell silent.</p>
<p>As they watched, the Loban ship hovered closer and closer to the sourcewell.  They crossed the edge of the clearing, and kept going, edging closer and closer.  The nose of their shuttle clipped the edge of the column of blazing light.</p>
<p>The sourcewell flared, and instantly engulfed the Loban ship.  It burned blue-green for a moment, and then returned to white, all impurities consumed.  There was no sign the Loban ship had ever existed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently they have somehow advanced this far with absolutely no knowledge of the dangers of sourcewells,&#8221; Galthas said.  &#8220;Who could have imagined?&#8221;</p>
<p>Urjik stared at him, wearing a look of dawning horror.  He had been in favor of attacking them openly, but not this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bespeak the ship,&#8221; Galthas said wearily.  &#8220;Tell them the Loban expedition has met a tragic end.  Tell them there are no survivors.&#8221; Tell them that from now on, nothing comes easy.  Tell them that out here it&#8217;s every man for himself.</p>
<p>Tell them this is <em>our</em> world now.  Why would we want more competitors?</p>

PLANETFALL
by Michael C. Lea

Galthas Talisar stepped out from the buzzing chaos of the transportal and onto lush greenery.  This world was alien, to be sure, but the patterns were almost familiar.  The ship's oracles had chosen well.

Behind him, the transportal hummed again.  An armored leg emerged and carefully found its footing on the blue-green ferns carpeting the jungle floor.  More than twenty thousand miles above, the leg's owner shifted his weight and stepped fully through an identical transportal, instantly emerging on the planet's surface below.

That cautious step belonged to Urjik, who could be called cautious in few other ways.  In fact, his reputation had left him few other options for a willing partner on this mission.  Urjik did not care. He and Galthas had fought together against the worst the Zayeen had to offer.  He trusted Galthas implicitly, despite his disdain for the other scrawny ascetics from Signet Battalion.

Urjik's greenish skin and jutting lower canines marked him as a charuk, his bloodline tainted by nether influences.  Despite this stigma, and despite his temper, he had risen quickly in Rampart Battalion.  Even the most burdensome battlesuit did not slow him, and no one was a truer shot with an inferno cannon or a hex-impelled railgun.

Galthas, by contrast, had the pale skin and slight build of the feytouched.  Unarmored and with no visible arms, he was nowhere near as physically imposing as Urjik.  Those who had seen Signet Battalion in action, however, knew that his bulky cold-iron armbands were weapons as formidable as any firearm or battleaxe, and far more versatile.

"Air's a little thick," Urjik said, "but it breathes."

"I could have told you that," Galthas replied softly, "since you insisted I go first."

Urjik flashed a tusky grin.  "I thought that was protocol," he said. "I always follow protocol."

Galthas frowned back over his shoulder at the armored charuk, but said nothing.  His companion was irrepressible, but Galthas had not quite recovered the use of his sense of humor yet.  It was one more thing the Zayeen had taken.  Perhaps here, on this world, they could find themselves again.

The transportal winked out behind them, the thaumaturgic sigil in its keystone deactivated from the other side.  No one else would be coming through.  For such a vital mission there would ordinarily be at least a full squadron, with clockwork or golems for logistical support. Here, as on dozens of other mission sites, there were only resources for a two-man team.

"Which way is it?" Urjik asked, looking around warily.  The air was warm and humid, and buzzed with strange insects like fat blue bees.

"We should be within twenty meters," Galthas said.  "This way, I think."

They moved through the brush, Galthas sliding quietly, Urjik with the subtlety of a tank.  His armor's servos whined as he plowed through flora and fauna alike.  The cluster of large multicolored crystals jutting from the center of the armor's back glowed as the suit drew power from them.

The undergrowth thinned.  A clearing lay just beyond.  They could feel a vibration in the aircedil; an indefinable high-energy presence, like a gathering thunderstorm.

Galthas turned back.  "Ready?" he asked.  "Either this is it, or this is something very bad."

Urjik hefted his high-powered Vindocladian inferno cannon to his shoulder and aimed its sigil-carved barrel into the clearing.  Inside the bulky rifle's main housing, a nether imp was caged, writhing in immortal fury but jacketed securely in heavy-duty curse-proofed lead.

"One of these days that thing's going to ba...</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.maryrobinettekowal.com/"><img class="alignright" style="margin: 3px;" title="Shades of Milk and HOney" src="http://www.tianevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ShadesOfMilkAndHoney-263x400.jpg" alt="" width="263" height="400" /></a>While I do not read romances, and I have not read a book by Jane Austen since high school, I nevertheless decided to pick up Shades of Milk and Honey by <a href="http://www.maryrobinettekowal.com/">Mary Robinette Kowal</a>. She is a brilliant writer, and I trusted her to write something I could endure. As it turned out, enduring the book wasn&#8217;t a problem &#8212; the hard part was putting it down.</p>
<p>The choice of detail in Shades of Milk and Honey is exquisite. Everything is described in spare, precise language. I can still see the glass cherries, the nymph&#8217;s face hidden in the tree, the dark and stormy bedroom of a heartsick girl. There is not a single wasted word or padded scene. That makes Shades of Milk and Honey a quick read. There is very little action until the dramatic ending, but that does not slow the narrative down. The majority of the book is concerned with interactions between people &#8212; with word and gesture, thought and response. I found it enthralling.</p>
<p>I believe the plot will be familiar to readers of romance. Two sisters named Jane and Melody try to walk the narrow path that society has marked for them, with the threat of scandal and ruin pressing in on both sides. Mary Robinette Kowal does not pull her punches in her portrayal of traditional marriage as an economic arrangement between families. As the sisters cannot inherit, they must either marry well or fall into poverty when their father dies. Romance in this setting is a matter of survival. Melody, who is beautiful, has no shortage of suitors. Jane, on the other hand, is cursed with a big nose and brown hair, and believes that she will never find a husband.</p>
<p>The aspect of the book that has gotten the most attention is its magic. Mary Robinette Kowal has made her book&#8217;s magic small and subtle, to avoid breaking history. This was not an easy task, and she has spoken at length about it elsewhere. The magic is called Glamour. It is the art of folding the ether to produce small illusions &#8212; a dress on a mannequin, a piece of ambient music to liven a party, or an elaborate &#8220;glamural&#8221; that turns a room into a forest glade. Jane has a particular talent for glamour, which gets her into trouble before it gets her out of it.</p>
<p>Just as the magic has been carefully constructed so as to allow the Regency period to proceed more or less as it did in the real world, the language in Shades of Milk and Honey has been chosen to fit the period. Modern readers will notice obvious examples of archaic English, such as &#8220;shew,&#8221; but the overall effect is wonderfully subtle, making the book feel right without distracting the reader. Shades of Milk and Honey is a deceptively simple book resting on a foundation of solid research.</p>
<p>I am told that there are plans for another book, which will involve swashbuckling. I can&#8217;t wait. I had my doubts about this book at first, but I&#8217;m glad I gave it a chance, and I am looking forward to the sequel.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A friend pointed out to me on <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonbaki" target="_blank">Twitter </a>just the other day that as of this week, it is exactly one year since I picked up my first Stephen King book and started reading. That book was <em>Under the Dome</em>, which came out in November 2009, and I was utterly enthralled from beginning to end. As soon as I had finished I set myself the task of reading all of his work, in publication order. A year later and I have only reached <em>The Stand</em> – hey, it was a busy year – but I’m still loving every single word.</p>

<p>As a genre reader and writer, it might sound surprising that I came so late to King’s work. While his career has had high points and low, he is generally considered a master of science fiction, horror, and just plain <em>writing</em>, ably treading the line between vast commercial success and quality content.</p>
<p>But the reason I only came to his gigantic body of work with his latest novel is that prior to this, I was a King snob. Commercial success on such a scale usually meant – so I thought – very poor writing. This is often the case, but it was that foray <em>Under the Dome</em> last November that taught me a very good lesson indeed, one that is second only to the pants<a href="#f1">*</a> rule.</p>
<p>It’s slightly oblique but I’ll try to explain. That lesson was: everything is about ‘the story’.</p>
<p>Okay? Hold tight. Here we go.</p>
<p>Currently we are continually bombarded with bad news about the publishing industry – about how publishing is on a downward slide, book sales are floundering while editors at the big houses flap to catch the next big trend or play it safe with unadventurous, unoriginal content. The industry is being shaken up by digital publishing and ebooks, while opportunities for new writers trying to get a break are shrinking more and more.</p>
<p>It would be easy, with all of this, to take a very bleak view, and certainly I’m not suggesting that the bad news is not true. If you were of a pessimistic nature you could lament the death of books and of writing as you sob into your cocoa in front of the TV. But there is one thing to remember amid this doom and gloom.</p>
<p>Writing and “the story”, to use some quasi-mystical catch-all, is all around us. Take a look at what you do during the day – strip out the day job (unless you actually make a living writing), the chores, the laundry, brushing your teeth, and look at what you do for entertainment, and what entertains you. I’m willing to bet that most of it, maybe 90%, is “the story”. And “the story” means <em>writing</em>.</p>
<p>There are more TV shows and films now than ever, and certainly in recent years a stonkingly good selection of exceptionally high-quality ones. It’s all “the story” – fiction, written by writers. And everything that surrounds it – special effects, marketing and merchandising, even the actors, producers, directors, crew, etc – are all there to deliver “the story” to us. The world of books is just one tiny facet – there are comics, television programmes, films, and games (video or otherwise). It’s all writing. It’s all “the story”.</p>
<p>Two things really crystalized this for me. Firstly, a couple of years ago I went to a comic convention which featured a host of writers and artists from DC Comics, including their commander-in-chief, Dan DiDio. During a weekend of panels and discussions, one thing became very clear. The DC universe is one giant story, a tale so big and sprawling that it literally covers the walls of several offices in New York. The job of DC is to deliver this to us, and to continue its development before passing the baton to the next batch of creators and producers. The same can be said of Marvel, or Image, or 2000AD, or any comic publisher or endeavour. The scale of it was quite frankly mind-blowing, and I came away from that con with my first suspicions about “the story” and how it impacted practically everything I did and was interested in and did.</p>
<p>The second moment of realisation came earlier this week, when I was fortunate enough to attend a small gathering of <em>Doctor Who</em> fans who were hosting an informal interview and Q&amp;A with <a href="http://www.daphneashbrook.com/" target="_blank">Daphne Ashbrook</a>, co-star of the 1996 US/UK <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(1996_film)" target="_blank">TV movie</a> with Paul McGann, currently visiting the UK. I’m a <em>Doctor Who</em> fan, I’m happy to admit, but I’ve always had difficulty with the TV Movie. This ‘difficulty’ has evolved from outright denial and upset (hey, I was a sensitive teenager in 1996) through to grudging acceptance of the production, so long as I didn’t actually have to watch it. So driving for an hour to see a co-star I wasn’t particularly interested in talk about a production I didn’t particularly care for seemed, beforehand at least, a bit of a chore. But, what the hell. When was this opportunity going to come up again.</p>
<p>Of course, it was a marvellous evening. Daphne was a delight, and kept us entertained for close to two hours on the ins and outs of her impressive career (come on, forget <em>Doctor Who</em>, she was in <em>Knight Rider</em>, <em>The A-Team</em>, and <em>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</em>; hell, even <em>Murder, She Wrote</em>). It was a revelation, especially when I realised that large parts of her lively discussion were her relaying to us the plot of these various shows, so we could have a better understanding of the role she played in each.</p>
<p>There it was. “The Story”. As an experienced actor, Daphne’s job is to deliver “the story” to us.  And “the story” means <em>writing</em>, plain and simple. Storytelling. Writing. Same thing.</p>
<p>So what’s the magic advice I distilled from all of this? Give up on the novel and try a screenplay? Not at all.</p>
<p>My advice is to realise that “the story” is everywhere, and like the guys from Pixar keep saying, “the story is king”. With this in mind, and knowing that writing is a never-ending quest to <em>get better</em>, it’s our job as writers to absorb as much of “the story” as we can. This means reading outside of our comfort zones and genres as well as within them – if I didn’t decide to try Stephen King I would never have discovered his extensive, and quite wonderful, back catalogue. When I was prepping to write a detective noir novel, I decided to bite the bullet and read <em>The Big Sleep </em>by Raymond Chandler. <em>Whammo</em>, the whole world of pulp detective fiction was opened to me.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/sleep.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1456" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/sleep.jpg" alt="" width="307" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>One often-quoted piece of writing advice is to not just turn off your television, but to get rid of it entirely. Stephen King himself goes off on this in <em>On Writing</em>. A lot of writers follow this advice to the letter and do very well indeed. But personally I think this is missing the point, because between the inane loops of twenty-four hour news, reality shows and quizzes, the blowhards that King describes so well in his memoir of the craft, there is some damn good stuff on, be it a television series (old or new) or a film (old or new). So if “the story” is about writing, then by picking and choosing carefully and by not letting it become a time-sink (and that really is where the danger lies and the advice stems from, I think), you can watch, enjoy, and <em>learn from</em> some very, very good examples of the craft.</p>
<p>“The story” is everywhere, and where the story is, you&#8217;ll find writing. That will never, ever go away, no matter what weekly slice of negativity comes from the traditional publishing industry. The world needs writers and always will, because our whole lives are based around storytelling.</p>
<p>Read books. Watch TV. Go to the movies. But importantly, read something you might not have thought you’d like, and watch a film that isn’t quite the genre you are interested in. At worst, you’ll absorb another little slice of “the story” that you wouldn’t have otherwise and you’ll learn something from it. At best, you’ll discover something new and wonderful and whole news worlds will instantly become available.</p>
<p>And then think about it, and learn from it, and <em>write</em>.</p>
<p><em><a name="f1">*</a> The pants rule is pretty simple and surprisingly effective: when writing comes up on your schedule, make sure you are up and doing and dressed. Don’t write in your pyjamas, don’t write in your slippers, no matter how appealing or comfortable it may sound. By “pants”, I mean trousers (not, as British people use it, as underpants&#8230; stop sniggering at the back there!), but that’s just a metaphor for being prepared and ready to write. The more prepped you are – showered, shaved, dressed, in a nice pair of shoes – the better your writing. If you want writing to be your job then act like it. Put on a nice shirt, or skirt, not just your comfy “at home” clothes. You can put those on when you’ve finished your job. In fact, the more formal you make it, the better you tend to feel (although I can’t imagine what happens to your writing if you turn up at your desk in full evening wear or a ball gown… I must give that a go sometime). Try it. It works!</em></p>

<p><strong>Kachikachi Yama</strong><br />
By Michael R. Underwood</p>
<p>The howl of the  northbound train builds in crescendo as I stand on the ledge of the  platform and hold the man above the tracks.  He flails at me.</p>
<p>The Shikoku station is far from empty.  Groaning bodies dot the  otherwise hospital-clean platform. A group of fleshmodded Gothic Lolita  girls watch us.  They look on with inhumanly white faces and void-black  eyes.  Twig-thin arms down to their knees wave in the wind. He begs.</p>
<p>My _denkigami’s_ polite but insistent voice chirps  in my head.  _“Yamagata-sama orders the target to be eliminated.”_  Spirit of the fleshware machine in my brain, my _denkigami_ is a  constant companion, and keeper of my leash.</p>
<p>The roar of the train grows louder, and bells ring in the  station.  The man pleads for his life.  The train’s lights appear from  around the around the corner.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/2010/11/11/ep-266-kachikachi-yama">Keep reading&#8230;</a><br />
<span id="more-1465"></span></p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>My daimyo’s summons  comes at 3:27 in the morning.  My _denkigami_ wakes me, and within  minutes I crawl through the servant’s entrance to his office, dressed  and ready in simple white silk kimono, my hair in a topknot.</p>
<p>The walls of his office are covered in the finest works from a  millennium’s worth of painters.  Basho, Caravaggio, Monet, Kiefer.</p>
<p>Yamagata  Kenichiro has never met my gaze.  My father served him and his father,  and I will know no other master until I retire as a nun or die in his  service.</p>
<p>Samurai.  From _Samuru_&#8211;“to serve.”</p>
<p>Yamagata-sama  grunts. “My honor has been violated.”  He pushes a digital tablet  across his desk.  The tablet shows a 360-degree image of a  fleshmod-tanned hacker in his twenties, data-port centered in a swirling  tattoo on the back of his neck.</p>
<p>Yamagata stands and places a hand on the desk. “This criminal has brought shame upon my wife and upon my house.”</p>
<p>“What is your desire, lord?”</p>
<p>Yamagata-sama’s eyes narrow.  “First, befriend him.  Then, humiliate him.”</p>
<p>He has not ordered me to do this before. “Why not just kill him, lord?”</p>
<p>Yamagata  slams his fist on the table. “It is not enough.”  He walks around the  table, leans over me and draws a finger down my face and across my  chin.  “He must know ecstasy before he knows agony.”  I restrain the  shudder.</p>
<p>He has always treated me like a woman first, a serving maid who  could kill instead of a worthy member of a noble line.  This is not a  job for a samurai, but I do not have a choice.  I serve him to honor my  family’s name, prove that we were worthy of elevation to the samurai  caste.</p>
<p>I take the tablet with both hands as I bow.  I crawl back through  the low gap in the synthetic rice-paper walls while the side door&#8211;the  one for his peers&#8211;remains closed.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>I pore  over the files at the steel desk in my modest apartment in the servant’s  wing.  A seven-mat front room large enough for a couch and exercise  equipment, and a five-mat bedroom room connected to a compact bathroom.</p>
<p>Synthetic _shoji_ walls give me no privacy, thin as rice-paper but  made of plastic.  My red-lacquered family shrine stands centered on my  dresser.  When I was a child, I slept in the front room, ‘my’ walls  covered in holoposters of the latest idols.</p>
<p>The target’s alias is “Tanuki”&#8211;the raccoon-dog trickster of ancient folklore.</p>
<p>A  flash of memory&#8211;ancestral armor and bound bamboo. Lessons on  _bushido_. “The way of the past is a unified one, my little rabbit.   Samurai must listen to the past and speak to the future.”</p>
<p>And so father insisted that I learn the old tales in addition to the  old skills.  He always taught two things at once: religion and  endurance; bullets and _bushido_.  To fail either lesson was to fail  both.  He wanted a son, but since Empress Toshi wed the first Imperial  Denkigami and proclaimed the second restoration, women have been allowed  to bear the _daisho_&#8211;the paired _katana_ and _wakizashi_&#8211;so that they  might serve.</p>
<p>My father taught me how to live.  Now I have my _denkigami_ and Yamagata-sama.</p>
<p>The dossier gives his school background, address, frequent haunts, and a detailed psychological profile.</p>
<p>Yamagata’s  orders will force me to do things below my station, but I am thankful  it does not involve killing.  I have murdered fifty-seven people by  Yamagata-sama’s bidding, and in slumber, I still hear each of their  screams.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>I ‘randomly’ meet Tanuki at a hacker café in  the Akihabara district, known more commonly now as Kachikachi Yama, the  ‘matchstick mountain,’ where the fire of creativity burns hottest and  brightest, most creative and most dangerous.  It is the home of the  elite _tensai_ hackers and aspirants alike.  I spend an hour in front of  the mirror, painting myself like a Heian-era lady-in-waiting.</p>
<p>The café is decorated like the digital heaven _Denkigoku_  itself, great clouds for the lampshades, the bar rising out of sea-blue  floor, the design a stylized island from an ancient painting.  Intense  colors and soft lines make the building into a waking dream.</p>
<p>Not three paces into the café and I catch his eye.  The profile  tells me he likes the classical beauties, no obvious fleshmods&#8211;strange  contrast to his profession.  I wonder, who is this man really?</p>
<p>I  order a green tea and flirt with the peek of a wrist as I inhale the  steam rolling off the cup.  Then I approach the table with the tiny  steps required in my many layers of _kimono_.  I miss my loose fighting  clothes and their freedom of motion.</p>
<p>“May I join you?” Classical beauties yes, but he liked his women  aggressive.  He rubs his shaved head and gestures to the seat.   “Please.”</p>
<p>I set down the tea and sit daintily, playing my  part.  I think of his work, and begin to play him like a dating sim.   After hours studying his file, I know which movies to hate, what media  feeds to quote. I play the part of a devoted fan.  I am his desires  sculpted into flesh.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>We go out twice before I begin to do  Yamagata-sama’s bidding.  My _denkigami_ reminds me always of my orders,  so I move more quickly to avoid its censure.</p>
<p>I remember my  father on the floor, a broken island in a still ocean of blood, the  crater in the back of his head his punishment for refusing an unjust  order.  I obey my _denkigami_.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>We stand on an open plain, wheat stalks swaying in the digital wind of _Denkigoku_.</p>
<p>He  is teaching me to hack.  An attempt at romance.  I hear my father’s  voice in my head. “For the samurai, every experience is a lesson.”</p>
<p>Tanuki’s avatar is the squat raccoon dog which gives him his  handle&#8211;with comically-oversized testicles hanging to the ground.  Mine  is a samurai woman in kabuki style, all in red, lacquered armor and  painted face&#8211;red streaks over a white base.</p>
<p>He says my avatar is cute.  I ignore the urge to rip off the tanuki’s testicles.  I listen.</p>
<p>Tanuki activates a protective _denkigami_, a blue-skinned _oni_ with four arms and Indian clothes.  It stands at attention.</p>
<p>“Every _denkigami_ has a counter.  Like rock-paper-scissors with a thousand symbols.”</p>
<p>He  activates the program, and the _oni_ levels its weapons at Tanuki.   “Unauthorized passage is not allowed.  Please provide your access code.”</p>
<p>Tanuki strokes the fur on his chin. “With the right program, any  _denkigami_ can be conquered.” He reaches between his legs and pulls out  a pair of fans.  Doing a dance with the fans, he leaps side to side and  the _oni_ drops its guard.</p>
<p>“Proceed, honored guest.”</p>
<p>He bests another dozen _denkigami_  to show his prowess.  Each time, he knows the perfect tool.  He holds up  a _naginata_, the traditional weapon of a noblewoman.</p>
<p>“This is  how I hacked the _denkigami_ of the wife of a corporate daimyo.  To beat  a _denkigami_, turn its power against itself, make it follow the rules  that control it in a way that forces it to obey your request.  With this  icon, I turned her resentment against Yamagata’s control into a  weapon.”</p>
<p>I smile and flatter him.  I learn two lessons&#8211; deception and hacking.  My father would approve.</p>
<p>Tanuki’s  show is complete, and my true task begins.  I meditated on this, asked  my father for guidance on the unjust order.  But I am samurai, and I  must serve.</p>
<p>We leave _Denkigoku_ after his lesson, return to his spartan  apartment.  To show my ‘thanks,’ for his indulgence, I take him to bed.   He is enthusiastic, clumsy, and greedy, drinking of my body.  I close  my eyes and think of freedom.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>_Denkigoku_ swirls into being when I dream, and I am again trapped by the spirits of those I’d killed.</p>
<p>I  lay on a green island floating in the vast sea of heaven, home to  machine spirits, the restless dead and the great spirits of nature.</p>
<p>Naked.  I’m always naked.  My protestation of purity or my weakness  before their rage?  I stand and snap off a branch from the island’s lone  bamboo tree and hold it like a blade.  I wait.</p>
<p>They come in twos  and threes, shining echoes of my victims.  Carried on the winds of  their screams, they fly at me; form a cloud as I wave them away with the  branch.</p>
<p>I plead with the dead. “Enough!  You must move on!  It was my duty!” the same words, the same response.</p>
<p>“Murderer!  Demon!  Vengeance!”</p>
<p>They  tear at me with bloodied claws.  The cuts cover my body in waves as the  branch passes through their red-soaked clothes.  A hand slaps away the  branch.</p>
<p>They knock me to the ground, and I curl into a shaking ball as their  screams mix with the sharp wind.  My scream joins the chorus.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>Tanuki  leaps out of bed when I wake him with my screams.  He tries to comfort  me, his arm around my shoulders.  I escape to his shower and shudder  alone.</p>
<p>Wrapped in his black towels, I bring him tea when I return.</p>
<p>Tanuki  leans back and strokes a beard he doesn’t have. We lounge on a bed  three times the size of my futon, with real silk sheets, a memory-shaped  mattress, and mahogany bedposts in western style.  His fleshmod tan  glistens in the afterglow.</p>
<p>After a night of drenched sheets, spent condoms and still-echoing electronic bass, I move to the next part of the plan.</p>
<p>“I heard about this new fleshware modification.  They say it is wonderful for hackers.”</p>
<p>“Which one?” he asks.  As if there’s the possibility he has not heard of it.</p>
<p>“It’s  a selective synasthesia.  Good for working in _Denkigoku_ for hacking.   So I hear.”  The smallest edge in the machine spirit world can mean the  difference between glory and humiliation.</p>
<p>He nods. “A few of the _tensai_ have it.”</p>
<p>“And you’re  a _tensai_.” I smile wide and make him believe I think he is one of the  elite. “I think we should go and get it together.” My fingers trace  along his chin.  He shivers, and the sheets shift over his groin. “I  don’t think I need it,” he says with a smile of his own.</p>
<p>“I want you to hear my kisses and taste my moans, Tanuki.  To  dance to the symphony of you in me.  Will you do that, for us?”   Yamagata has made a samurai into a common concubine.</p>
<p>I push aside the sheets and slide my hands up his chest.  He dissembles, and I grit my teeth to contain my frustration.</p>
<p>“You’re tensai, but with this, you could be _Tensai Ichiban_.”   _Tensai Ichiban_, the number one hacker in the world, a coveted position  which led to many hackers’ ends by blades or bullets in back alleys or  digital mountaintops.</p>
<p>He leans back, looks at his wall of hardware, staring past the screens into his imagined future. “_Tensai Ichiban_.”</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>_Hanamichi_  is my favorite fleshware parlor, I tell Tanuki.  They are actually a  new Yamagata-Corp acquisition, but the deal has yet to reach the media.</p>
<p>Deep blue mood lighting fills the room, with gel-sculpted  couches, news feeds on the wall-panels, and local rock DJ-ed off one of  the flesh artist’s rigs.</p>
<p>Our artist is agelessly young,  fleshmodded to look like a golden age _anime_ heroine.  Her eyes take up  a quarter of her face, and her mouth is no wider than my thumb.</p>
<p>The artist explains the procedure to Tanuki.  The synasthetic  mod is sculpted to the sensory system, acting as a processing center for  sensory input.  Left alone, it channels the information to the  traditional centers.  When accessed consciously, it takes sensory input  and redirects it to be processed by other modalities.</p>
<p>Tanuki nods and I can see him salivating at what the fleshmod can  give him&#8211;the edge in _Denkigoku_, the power needed to vie to be _Tensai  Ichiban_.</p>
<p>That is what I want him to believe.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>We recover from the procedure for a week, letting the brain  acclimate to the possibilities.  The whole time, Tanuki can only talk  about becoming _Tensai Ichiban_.  He ignores the fleshmodder’s advice  and drinks, smokes, and paces around his apartment.</p>
<p>“This is going to be amazing, Yuriko.” He knows me by my mother’s name.  She took her life when my father died.  I was fifteen.</p>
<p>“Most  of these losers, they don’t even know about this.” He taps his head  where the skull was pulled back.  He winces, teeth flashing through a  grimace. “Everything in _Denkigoku_ will be different.  Data will sing.   Graphics will boil my blood.”</p>
<p>I smile again, and pretend to be weak from the procedure he thinks I  have had with him.  The fleshmod artist merely gave me the appropriate  scar, perpendicular five-centimeter cuts.</p>
<p>“That fucker Yamagata will never know what hit him.  It&#8221;ll even top what I did to his wife.”</p>
<p>“Yamagata?  As in the Yamagata Corporation?”  Feigning interest  is not hard, this time.  Hearing his side might illuminate  Yamagata-sama’s motivations for making a concubine of me.</p>
<p>“After  I slipped into his personal datanet and hacked his wife’s _denkigami_, I  had her go to him and screw.  He was surprised at first, but he got so  into it!  I had them do the dirtiest stuff&#8230;I doubt they’d screwed  since she squeezed out his heir!”</p>
<p>Tanuki clapped like a giddy child. “And then, just as he was finishing, I hacked her voicebox and told him what I did!”</p>
<p>This  was the affront that Yamagata-sama had assigned me to revenge.   Embarrassment for embarrassment.  Tanuki should notice my flared  nostrils, the clenched fingers, but he isn’t even looking at me anymore.</p>
<p>“And now I’m going to rob him blind so we can go around the world, Yuriko.”</p>
<p>I giggle for him, hand over mouth.  I hate Tanuki for the way I have to act.  I hate Yamagata-sama more.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>Tanuki buys sake and decorates his apartment, makes a party of  his first journey to _Denkigoku_ after having the synasthetic installed.</p>
<p>I  wanted it to be the two of us, but he insisted.  Eight of his hacker  friends are there, all fake-tanned like him, small men with big egos.   They congregate and talk about clan raids on the latest online pro  circuit.</p>
<p>He has three oversized screens suspended from the ceiling,  usually for his casual viewing pleasure.  Tonight, we will watch him as  he goes in for Yamagata Corp’s payroll.</p>
<p>After a few drinks,  some ranting about his expertise and the corruption of the Zaibatsu  feudal system, Tanuki begins.  He spreads the rice, says the chant, and  plugs in to make the journey to _Denkigoku_.  There, hackers style  themselves warriors battling digital _oni_ security systems and currying  favor with the _denkigami_, machine spirits of the new Japanese empire.</p>
<p>On my signal, my _denkigami_ makes the call to Yamagata-sama’s  men.  Its voice gives me confirmation.  _“We will wait now.   Yamagata-sama will be pleased.”_</p>
<p>The surreal world of  _Denkigoku_ swirls into visibility on the three screens.  Painted clouds  in ancient style dot the electric-blue sky, ten thousand _denkigami_  flying through the air, the traffic constant.</p>
<p>He walks across moss-covered bridges in the old style, under rows of  towering red _torii_&#8211;the sacred gates separating common space from the  sacred territory of the Yamagata Corporation.</p>
<p>Tanuki is  salivating like a dog, so enthralled by the synasthetic.  He brags as he  goes.  “This is amazing!  The air tastes like salmon.  The _torii_  sound like bells.”  Yuri, I wish you were here with me.”</p>
<p>I sip sake and watch as Tanuki walks into the trap Yamagata-sama has prepared.</p>
<p>The  white walls of Yamagata’s castle stretch three screens high, the  representation of the corporation’s digital holdings in _Denkigoku_.</p>
<p>Tanuki’s waddling avatar approaches the gate, facing looming  _oni_ with black skin and bulbous tusks and weapons three times his  size.  He laughs, his hands coursing through the air making commands.   The avatar reaches into its crotch to pull out the digital tool he would  use to trick his way past the _oni_ security.  Tanuki told me he  planned to use a hypnotic program he had been working on, represented by  a vintage _pokemon_.</p>
<p>Instead, his avatar pulls up a flapping _koi_ fish, which  splashes water in his face.  The avatar stumbles backwards and lands on  top of the oversized testicles.  The _oni_ draw closer.</p>
<p>“Please  provide your security code!”  Their voices bellow through Tanuki’s  speakers, maxing the audio.  The sound waves crash against my chest, and  I take another sip.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?  Come on, work, dammit!” Tanuki scrambles  backwards, flailing for the tool he needs, but all that will come out  are _koi_, each more unwieldy and useless than the last.</p>
<p>The  _oni_ run him off with pounding threats, and Tanuki’s so-called friends  laugh.  The piggyback program does its duty.  The synasthesia is  selective as promised in the earthly realm, but in _Denkigoku_, it is  completely random and incomprehensible.  His mind is convinced sounds  are touches, tastes are vision.  He will be permanently disabled in  _Denkigoku_, never able to hack again.</p>
<p>Yamagata-sama’s revenge is complete.</p>
<p>So I think.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>I  sit once more in Yamagata-sama’s study, in the attentive _seiza_  posture, feet and ankles tucked beneath me.  I have given my report.</p>
<p>Yamagata-sama strokes his beard and grunts wordless phrases.</p>
<p>“Well  done.  However, I am not satisfied.  He will suffer for a month, and  then you will dispose of him.  Take him to Shikoku.  Leave his body  there.”</p>
<p>I bow.  Fifty-seven spirits plague my dreams, and now  Yamagata-sama is telling me there will be one more, a tanuki with  plastic glasses.  First he debases me, and then makes my demeaning act a  cruel prelude to murder.</p>
<p>I crawl out of Yamagata’s office and return to my apartment to prepare.  I burn incense for my parents and go to kill Tanuki.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>Tanuki  proves himself not a total fool.  Five tattooed yakuza surround me in  the train station when I arrive, razorwire blades and outlawed guns  trained on me.  My hand rests on the hilt of my blade.  I wait.</p>
<p>Tanuki gloats. “Hello lover. A friend of mine tipped me off, so I  thought I’d bring some friends on our getaway trip.  How pissed do you  think he’ll be when I send his samurai lapdog’s head back to him?”</p>
<p>I don’t bother to respond.  The game is over; I do not have to pretend for him anymore.</p>
<p>For a long moment, the world is still, six bodies ready to explode into motion while Tanuki stands back and laughs.</p>
<p>A  tall man with a red dragon tattoo around his torso flinches, takes a  stutter-step forward.  I leap and draw.  Ancient steel cuts through  fleshmodded muscle.  An arm hits the ground.</p>
<p>I spin with soft steps, turning to keep the other four in my sight.</p>
<p>My  _denkigami_ chirps a warning in my head. _“Overhand blow, position  seven.”_ It warns me in time to tilt to the side and let the thin blade  cut the air beside my ear.</p>
<p>Two yakuza tackle me, thinking their mass enough to overpower  one small woman, samurai or not.  We crash into a pillar and my head  cracks against marble.</p>
<p>My _katana_ bursts from the back of  one&#8211;impaled by his own momentum.  I push and spin to pull out the  blade.  I slice at his companion, face fleshmodded to look like an  _oni_.  His skin is red, his nose bulbous, his mouth full of fangs.  My  grandfather’s sword widens his mouth to his cheekbone.</p>
<p>Two steps sideways and I reverse the blade.  My head drops as I  spin in place and kick a gun out of one’s hands.  _Katana_ follows foot  and splits the man’s collarbone.</p>
<p>My _denkigami’s_ warning to  roll comes too late.  Pain bursts in my back.  The blade clatters on  concrete.  My head cracks against the wall of a magazine stand.  Two  more pains blossom in my chest.</p>
<p>A steaming gun barrel stands in the air, held by a yakuza not  out of junior high.  I roll to the side and my vision tracks as if I’d  indulged in too much sake.  We lock eyes.  He flinches, and I pluck the  gun from his hand while he blinks.</p>
<p>A sharp elbow to the temple drops him to the floor.  I turn and  fire a bullet through Tanuki’s thigh as he runs up the stairs.  Tossing  the gun aside, I retrieve my target.  I lift him with both arms and move  to hold him over the edge.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>The lights of the train grow wider at the end of the tunnel as I hold Tanuki over the edge of the Shikoku line platform.</p>
<p>I grit my teeth from the strain.  I show him my real face, too long hidden behind makeup and insincere smiles.</p>
<p>“I am Ryoji Usagiko, vassal of Yamagata Kenichiro, and I have  been ordered to erase the stain you have made upon the honor of the  Yamagata.”</p>
<p>“Please, don’t kill me!  I’ll do anything, you hear?   I’ll work for Yamagata, apologize to his wife, hand over other hackers.   Please!”</p>
<p>He will join murderers and traitors, slave-runners and callous  _ronin_, more voice in the growing chorus of my nightmares.  He may  deserve death less than they, but he will scream for my death just as  loud.</p>
<p>My _denkigami_ in my head again. “The train will arrive in 7.3 seconds.”</p>
<p>Light  fills the platform. If I leave him, he will bankrupt himself seeking  revenge.  I let go and watch his eyes go wide as I let go.  He drops  below the platform.</p>
<p>I turn on the balls of my feet, walk past the nonplussed girls, and return to Tanuki’s apartment to complete one last task.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>Yamagata  smiles when I give my report.  He walks out from behind his desk to set  a hand on my shoulder.  I bow with my hands together, each in the  opposite sleeve of my _kimono_.  The sentiment comes too late.</p>
<p>I draw the tiny knife from my sleeve and leap to my feet.  The  knife draws a crimson smile across Yamagata-sama’s throat, and I drop my  former master to the floor.</p>
<p>My _denkigami_ would have  stopped me, stayed my hand before I could act.  But I learned my lessons  well.  The once-constant voice is now quiet.</p>
<p>Looking down at my master, we lock eyes.  I watch surprise mix with outrage, then give way to fear.</p>
<p>“You  have violated the oaths of fealty between master and servant, dirtied  yourself and your vassals. The Ryoji family no longer has need of the  Yamagata’s patronage.” No other words have been as pleasurable.</p>
<p>The weight of my father’s murder drops from my shoulders as I leave Yamagata dying on the floor.  I leave by the side exit.</p>
<p>This time, I do not have to crawl.</p>

Kachikachi Yama
By Michael R. Underwood

The howl of the  northbound train builds in crescendo as I stand on the ledge of the  platform and hold the man above the tracks.nbsp; He flails at me.

The Shikoku station is far from empty.nbsp; Groaning bodies dot the  otherwise hospital-clean platform. A group of fleshmodded Gothic Lolita  girls watch us.nbsp; They look on with inhumanly white faces and void-black  eyes.nbsp; Twig-thin arms down to their knees wave in the wind. He begs.

My _denkigamirsquo;s_ polite but insistent voice chirps  in my head.nbsp; _ldquo;Yamagata-sama orders the target to be eliminated.rdquo;_  Spirit of the fleshware machine in my brain, my _denkigami_ is a  constant companion, and keeper of my leash.

The roar of the train grows louder, and bells ring in the  station.nbsp; The man pleads for his life.nbsp; The trainrsquo;s lights appear from  around the around the corner.

Keep reading...


*nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; *nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; *

My daimyorsquo;s summons  comes at 3:27 in the morning.nbsp; My _denkigami_ wakes me, and within  minutes I crawl through the servantrsquo;s entrance to his office, dressed  and ready in simple white silk kimono, my hair in a topknot.

The walls of his office are covered in the finest works from a  millenniumrsquo;s worth of painters.nbsp; Basho, Caravaggio, Monet, Kiefer.

Yamagata  Kenichiro has never met my gaze.nbsp; My father served him and his father,  and I will know no other master until I retire as a nun or die in his  service.

Samurai.nbsp; From _Samuru_--ldquo;to serve.rdquo;

Yamagata-sama  grunts. ldquo;My honor has been violated.rdquo;nbsp; He pushes a digital tablet  across his desk.nbsp; The tablet shows a 360-degree image of a  fleshmod-tanned hacker in his twenties, data-port centered in a swirling  tattoo on the back of his neck.

Yamagata stands and places a hand on the desk. ldquo;This criminal has brought shame upon my wife and upon my house.rdquo;

ldquo;What is your desire, lord?rdquo;

Yamagata-samarsquo;s eyes narrow.nbsp; ldquo;First, befriend him.nbsp; Then, humiliate him.rdquo;

He has not ordered me to do this before. ldquo;Why not just kill him, lord?rdquo;

Yamagata  slams his fist on the table. ldquo;It is not enough.rdquo;nbsp; He walks around the  table, leans over me and draws a finger down my face and across my  chin.nbsp; ldquo;He must know ecstasy before he knows agony.rdquo;nbsp; I restrain the  shudder.

He has always treated me like a woman first, a serving maid who  could kill instead of a worthy member of a noble line.nbsp; This is not a  job for a samurai, but I do not have a choice.nbsp; I serve him to honor my  familyrsquo;s name, prove that we were worthy of elevation to the samurai  caste.

I take the tablet with both hands as I bow.nbsp; I crawl back through  the low gap in the synthetic rice-paper walls while the side door--the  one for his peers--remains closed.

*nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; *nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; *

I pore  over the files at the steel desk in my modest apartment in the servantrsquo;s  wing.nbsp; A seven-mat front room large enough for a couch and exercise  equipment, and a five-mat bedroom room connected to a compact bathroom.

Synthetic _shoji_ walls give me no privacy, thin as rice-paper but  made of plastic.nbsp; My red-lacquered family shrine stands centered on my  dresser.nbsp; When I was a child, I slept in the front room, lsquo;myrsquo; walls  covered in holoposters of the latest idols.

The targetrsquo;s alias is ldquo;Tanukirdquo;--the raccoon-dog trickster of ancient folklore.

A  flash of memory--ancestral armor and bound b...</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&#8220;For my part, I prefer aliens that look alien. Then when they ritually eat their first-born, or turn arthropod halfway through their life-cycle, it isn&#8217;t so much of a shock. You expect it. Humanoid aliens, they&#8217;re trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211; Mary Gentle, <strong>The Golden Witchbreed</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few months ago, I finally picked up Mary Gentle&#8217;s science fiction duology, The Golden Witchbreed and its sequel, Ancient Light. The story that begins in The Golden Witchbreed is standard SF: A human ambassador arrives on an alien world to assist the first contact team, and finds herself snarled in local politics. The difference lies, first, in what those local politics turn out to be, and second, in Mary Gentle&#8217;s deft handling of character and interwoven plotlines.</p>
<p>The alien planet, Orthe, is inhabited by humanoid aliens who are just human enough to make the ambassador trip up &#8212; and the reader, too, if she&#8217;s not careful. The Ortheans are drawn with superb attention to detail. Most of the aliens that the reader meets in The Golden Witchbreed live in small holdings that answer to a larger, elected-as-needed assembly of representatives, and an elected monarch who rules by divine right. Mary Gentle does not make the mistake of having a One World Culture for her aliens, however, or even just a few variations on a theme.</p>
<p>As the ambassador travels away from the capital city, the reader gets to see one culture shade into another. I enjoyed watching the ambassador slowly adapt to Orthe. As her grasp of the language and social niceties moves from being trained, to being practiced, to being second nature, the vocabulary in her narration changes. The humans have classed the Ortheans as a pretech, but when a group of Barbarians arrive in the hollowed-out hull of an ancient flying machine, both the reader and the ambassador realize that something far stranger is going on.</p>
<p>The Golden Witchbreed is a good book, but it is not a complete story without Ancient Light. Ancient Light begins twenty years after the ambassador leaves Orthe. Political upheaval on Earth has left her without a government to represent &#8212; instead, she answers to the Company. Having discovered the ruins of an ancient civilization on Orthe, the Company wants to know whether any of the alien technology could be put to human use. Alien politics, human politics, alien religion, and the ambassador&#8217;s own shaky hold on her sanity raise the stakes in Ancient Light to the point where I finished this book standing up &#8212; because finding a chair would have meant looking away from the page.</p>
<p>Orthe is a world so finely balanced that mere observation by an outsider is enough to change the system. To me, these books read as a statement about invasion and colonization, though Mary Gentle never wields the message stick hard enough to make me confident that&#8217;s what she was trying to say. The Orthe duology is good science fiction, and has as much to say about our past as our future. I recommend these books without hesitation.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="Zero History" src="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/underwire/2010/09/Zero-History-cover.jpg" alt="" width="116" height="180" />With the possible exception of the Very Ugly Shirt, I think I&#8217;ve seen all of the technology in <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/" target="_blank">William Gibson&#8217;s</a> new novel,<em> Zero History</em>, featured on <a href="http://boingboing.net">BoingBoing</a>. <em>Zero History</em> is a science fiction novel because a science fiction writer wrote it. If it had been written by someone other than William Gibson, it could have been shelved with the thrillers. On the other hand, <em>Zero History</em> does two things that science fiction is supposed to do: It examines the impact of technology on human beings; and if the science was taken out, the plot wouldn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>Hubertus Bigend, the eccentric billionaire from <em>Pattern Recognition</em> and <em>Spook Country</em>, once again recruits the former rock star, Hollis Henry. This time he&#8217;s tracking a fashion genius whose anti-advertising has created an underground sensation. With the former benzo addict Milgrim, would-be military contractors, and a surprisingly straightforward romantic subplot, William Gibson pulls together another intricate and enthralling novel.</p>
<p>I found this book to be more ambivalent than the other two. Fear drives the characters. I have not figured out what Hollis is running from, aside from her mysterious and frightening benefactor. Milgrim is remembering what fear is like without sedatives to insulate him from the world. The generalized paranoia that underlies modern military-worship keeps the nominal bad guys moving through a series of misunderstood signals that might have been comic if the stakes didn&#8217;t feel so high. At the end, despite the protagonists&#8217; celebrations, I had the unsettling impression that the bad guys won.</p>
<p><em>Zero History</em> is a continuation of the series that started with <em>Pattern Recognition</em>. It brings back both the style and many of the characters from those books, not his earlier work. Gibson&#8217;s precisely-machined writing is a pleasure to read, as always. He lets his plot drift, so it feels like all the characters are sliding slowly and inevitably towards towards a single point of crisis. While <em>Zero History</em> never reaches the frenzy I remember from other Gibson novels, it kept me engaged until the end. Also, I adored the bit with the penguin.</p>
<p>I will reread this book.<em> Zero History</em> is not a stand-alone novel, and I believe I will benefit from reading the whole series in order. Readers who are looking for a return to <em>Neuromancer</em> will be disappointed. Fans of the other Bigend books should pick this one up, too.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[If I only read e-books, I'd never have stopped at the B&#38;N discount rack on my recent vacation and picked up <i>A Princess of Mars</i>. There's a reason it's a classic.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I&#8217;m going to miss terribly when e-books are the norm and brick-and-mortar stores are few and far between will be the opportunity to walk into a bookstore, pick up the one thing I really want to read, and then hit the discount rack on the way to the checkout. That&#8217;s exactly what I did when I was in Florida recently, picking up <a href="http://escapepod.org/2010/10/22/book-review-i-shall-wear-midnight-by-terry-pratchett/">I Shall Wear Midnight</a>, which I later reviewed on this site.</p>
<p>Among the books I picked up on my way out of the store was a three-pack of <em>John Carter of Mars</em> novels, by Edgar Rice Burroughs. I&#8217;d heard there might be a movie coming soon, and I wanted to familiarize myself with a sci-fi classic that I probably should&#8217;ve read long ago anyway.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve finished <em>A Princess of Mars</em>, I can sort of see why they&#8217;re classics. <em>Sort of.</em></p>
<p>Like many novels written in the late 19th/early 20th century, <em>A Princess of Mars</em> starts out with the discovery of a manuscript by the author himself, and his memories of &#8220;Uncle Jack&#8221;. Burroughs uses the device effectively to set up the mythology of John Carter, and then jumps into the story. The first act is fairly straightforward: Carter goes to Mars, discovers he&#8217;s stronger than most everyone there, and manages to impress the natives. Burroughs spends a lot of time describing this new world, and though most readers of current fiction would say <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tldr">tl;dr</a> or bemoan the author&#8217;s use of infodumps, that was the style back then, so I give it a pass. At the end of that act, he meets Dejah Thoris, the eponymous Princess of Mars, and decides he&#8217;s fallen in love with her.</p>
<p>By this point in the novel, I&#8217;d hit on its major sticking point &#8212; at least, in my mind &#8212; and it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve seen in other fiction of the era: John Carter&#8230; well, he&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p>No, he&#8217;s not awesome. He&#8217;s AWESOME. There&#8217;s literally nothing John Carter cannot do on Mars: he has superior strength, agility, martial prowess, physical attractiveness (as compared to humans of Earth, not the Green Men of Barsoom), problem-solving skills, intelligence, and luck. It&#8217;s like God rolled a series of <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=natural%2020">natural 20s</a> when He was creating Carter, and Carter knows exactly how to take advantage of that. He instantly figures out how to move in Mars&#8217;s lower gravity. He applies his knowledge of battle from the Civil War to fighting alongside several different alien races. He isn&#8217;t completely floored by the weird appearance of the Tharks (the green men of Mars). He learns to speak the Martian language and use Martian telepathy despite not &#8212; to our knowledge, anyway &#8212; knowing any languages other than English nor how to be telepathic at all beforehand.</p>
<p>And, what&#8217;s more, he instantly wins the trust of pretty much <em>everyone</em> around him. The few who don&#8217;t like him are so clearly Stereotypical Evil Characters that the reader knows almost immediately they&#8217;ll be getting some kind of comeuppance, most likely at Carter&#8217;s hands (or sword).</p>
<p>The rest of the story is spent on getting Carter back together with Thoris &#8212; they are separated in the second act &#8212; and it&#8217;s kind of blah through there (there&#8217;s even a pod racing scene, sort of) before the grand finale, when Carter leads the good Martians against some really, really, unmistake-ably <em>evil</em> Martians. Kind of like how, in Star Trek 6, there were honorable Klingons and evil Klingons.</p>
<p>Overall, I really enjoyed the book. There was lots of adventure, interesting scenery and worldbuilding, and if the aliens were a little too human, that&#8217;s not really a failing &#8212; it&#8217;s just the way stories were written back then. Besides, the characters are consistent within themselves &#8212; none of them do anything that immediately drags you out of the story. The ending wraps up a little too fast, as stories from that era were wont to do, but that&#8217;s okay, because we know there&#8217;ll be more John Carter of Mars stories coming up. I feel bad for readers of that era, who didn&#8217;t know there&#8217;d be more.</p>
<p><em>A Princess of Mars</em> is short enough that you can read it in a weekend, if you read at a good clip. The version I have has some very nice illustrations by Thomas Yeates, and an introduction by Mike Ashley that lays out the history of the Barsoom series. The book itself is suitable for reading by mature tweens who are already into sci-fi or adventure stories, though the illustrations do contain PG-13 nudity (Carter himself shows up naked on Mars, and to assimilate with the Tharks, he forgoes clothing as they do). I&#8217;m glad I picked it up, and I&#8217;m currently enjoying the second book, <em>Gods of Mars</em>, which is part of the omnibus.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="Gregor the overlander" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/95/The_Underland_Chronicles_-_Gregor_the_Overlander.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="318" />I am the mom of an eight-year-old, so I do keep up with the kids&#8217; book market, but I chose these books because they were written by the Queen of Pacing, Suzanne Collins, author of the huge hit, <em>The Hunger Games</em> trilogy. (Which I loved, despite the disappointment of <em>Mockingjay</em>, but that&#8217;s another blog post.) When I found that she&#8217;d written five midgrade novels, I got them via <a href="http://www.emusic.com" target="_blank">eMusic</a>. (not an affiliate link, I do love eMusic for their catalog and their non-DRM files.)</p>
<p>Here is where I&#8217;m firmly believing that tropes and clichés don&#8217;t kill stories; bad writing kills stories. If I told you the basic plot- boy in our world falls into mysterious magical underground kingdom were he&#8217;s prophesied to save them all, you&#8217;d snort and say, &#8220;oh, <em>that&#8217;s</em> original.&#8221; But so what? Original or not, Collins makes it awesome.</p>
<p>Gregor is eleven, and a pretty responsible kid, since his grandmother has dementia and his mom takes care of him, his seven year old sister Lizzie, and his two year old sister Boots. His dad disappeared over two years ago, and he&#8217;s had to take on a lot of the childcare (and elder care) since his mom works to support the five of them. He falls into the Underland, where they immediately treat him like a dirty stranger (they keep insisting he bathe) and he inadvertently offends them frequently. Then we find out about the prophesy, and the giant rats, and a quest, and it&#8217;s a whole thing.</p>
<p>What makes Collins&#8217; work shine is, of course, her pacing, which keeps me sitting in the car long after I&#8217;ve gotten home to get to the end of a chapter. But her characters are also awesome. Gregor should show a little more fear as an eleven year old- he admits to a fear of heights, but we never see this fear manifest- but he&#8217;s a solid kid who&#8217;s smart but impulsive. The surprise is how well his two year old sister fits into the story. Boots is charming and fun and has a weird ability to tell the giant cockroaches (&#8220;crawlers&#8221; is the polite term) apart, something the Underlanders can&#8217;t even do. When she has a tantrum in the first book, it&#8217;s perfectly suited to the situation, and even comes in handy as they&#8217;re captured by some creatures who don&#8217;t like loud noises.</p>
<p>Sometimes it seems a little too easy traveling with a two year old (I seem to remember my two year old not being so ready to accept a brand new schedule, never mind constant adventure), and the descriptions in the underland sometimes seem too clear to allow for the amount of light they had available, but those are minor complaints to an otherwise fun read.</p>
<p>Prophesies, other lands, and heroic outsiders are common tropes in fantasy, but give them to a talented writer, and you will still have a book you can&#8217;t put down. I&#8217;ve finished the first two, <em>Gregor the Overlander </em>and <em>The Prophesy of Bane</em>, and I&#8217;m eager to get the other three. Highly recommended for any mid-grade reader (or adult) who loves adventure.</p>
<p>(Since this is an audio podcast, I should mention the audiobook is a great listen, the narrator giving life to the characters. The consistency isn&#8217;t the same through the books, though, which is irritating. A major rat character sounds bored and sardonic in book 1 and scratchy and mean in book 2&#8230;.)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like many writers, I&#8217;m not very good at making time to write. My days are, well, packed. I&#8217;m up at 5:15 to go to the gym, on the road at 7:20 to commute to work, at my desk by 8:30, back on the road between 5:30 and 6:00, home by 6:45 if I&#8217;m lucky, having dinner and spending time with the kid, then after she goes to bed I have to pack my stuff for the next day, make lunches, and am lucky to have half an hour to myself before going up to bed between 9:15 and 9:30. There I read for 15 minutes to unwind my brain, and then lights out.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing that I manage to write <em>anything</em>, given that crazy schedule.</p>
<p>A friend of mine said that if I love writing, I shouldn&#8217;t give it up to exercise, but if you&#8217;ve seen me, you know I need it. I accept that. It&#8217;s why I joined the gym in the first place.</p>
<p>But I do write. A little, here and there. Sometimes at work, sometimes in the evenings, sometimes on the weekends (which are consumed by family time for the most part). I remember reading somewhere that David Mack, when he started out, would write for a few hours at night, giving up sleep in favor of writing<a href="#jr_nano1">*</a>. I tried that too. The thing is, I&#8217;m not one of those people who can just sit down and start writing, especially if I&#8217;m in the middle of a story. I need to be in the zone &#8212; reread a little bit, get back into the characters, remember what I wanted to do next, and then actually be able to do the writing (and have enough time to do it, like people who write on their lunch breaks).</p>
<p>Why am I telling you all this?</p>
<p>Because I&#8217;m jealous. I&#8217;m extremely jealous, in fact.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> is this month, and I&#8217;m not doing it.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m jealous of people who have the commitment and the drive and above all else the ability to make time to write 50,000 words in a month. Which isn&#8217;t to say I <em>can&#8217;t</em> do it &#8212; I wrote a 17,000-word novella in a couple of weeks, back in early 2009. But right now isn&#8217;t my time. Nor was last year. Or the year before that. Or the year before that. And so on. I accept that.</p>
<p>But do you follow any writers on Twitter? Because if you follow folks like <a href="http://twitter.com/nobilis">Nobilis</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/voidmunashii">Void Munashii</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/inkhaven">Inkhaven</a>, or your favorite fanfic writer (a <em>lot</em> of them do it), you&#8217;re seeing word counts, status updates, messages of joy as your writer friends reach milestones&#8230; and the bad stuff too: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t write today.&#8221; &#8220;My plot isn&#8217;t working out.&#8221; &#8220;This story sucks, but I have to finish it.&#8221; &#8220;I lost all my saved files.&#8221;</p>
<p>I like my writer friends, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but reading their progress reports just makes me sad. As a writer without the time or the ability to make said time, all I can do is look on and occasionally offer congratulatory or sympathetic messages. And I can tell myself, &#8220;maybe next year.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been telling myself that for five years now. Might as well keep up the tradition in 2011, too.</p>
<p>And now, your reward for reading my self-indulgent whining: a music video for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhs-yodZJcw">&#8220;The Nanowrimo Song&#8221; by All Caps.</a> Enjoy.</p>
<p><a name="jr_nano1">*</a> <em>This may be apocryphal<a href="#jr_nano2">**</a>, but I&#8217;m sure Mack isn&#8217;t the only writer to ever do this.</em></p>
<p><a name="jr_nano2">**</a> <em>As Mack noted in the comments, this is indeed true. I should&#8217;ve said I might be misremembering &#8212; totally my bad on the incorrect use of &#8220;apocryphal&#8221;. Sorry about that.</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Y’know, Halloween has always felt like the perfect time for storytelling. Whether it is ghost stories by the campfire, or Hammer horror from the comfort of your own living room (my personal preference), its just the perfectly obvious season for the supernatural and scarifying. While it has ever been thus for people like you and me, it seems to be catching on in the mainstream too. AMC’s zombie TV series <a href="http://www.amctv.com/originals/The-Walking-Dead/" target="_blank"><em>The Walking Dead</em></a>, based on the Eisner award-winning <a href="http://www.hiddenrobot.com/WALKINGDEAD/" target="_blank">comic book series from Image</a>, premiered to their biggest debut audience ever at 5.3 million viewers. Seasonal television is an American staple (perhaps less so here in the UK), with even series like the surreal college sitcom <a href="http://www.nbc.com/community/" target="_blank"><em>Community</em></a> playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology_(Community)" target="_blank">quite brilliantly</a> with the zombie genre just a couple of days before.</p>
<p>Halloween also saw the launch of a new, free online podcast magazine and website, showcasing the best in genre short fiction. <a href="http://www.darkfictionmagazine.co.uk/" target="_blank"><em>Dark Fiction Magazine</em></a> is the brainchild of <strong>Sharon Ring</strong> and <strong>Del Lakin-Smith</strong>, two names familiar to the UK genre scene. Their stated aim is to produce a monthly short fiction podcast magazine, featuring at least four short stories in each issue focussed around a distinct theme.</p>
<p>In the spirit of ‘a rising tide lifts all boats’ (thanks for that, Mur!), we spoke to Sharon and Del about their new project and what people can expect.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/DFMScreenshot1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1403" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/DFMScreenshot1.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="368" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Escape Pod: Thanks for joining us! Let’s start with yourselves – wh</strong><strong>at are your respective backgrounds, and what gave you the idea of starting <em>Dark Fiction Magazine</em>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Del</strong>: I have been working in IT for over 15 years in one form or another and have either run or helped out on numerous websites, so I have my feet firmly in the cloud, so to speak. I’m also obsessed with music, audio engineering and genre.</p>
<p>I launched a podcast in February of last year called <a href="http://www.wordpunk.co.uk/" target="_blank"><em>WordPunk</em></a> which covers all sorts of geeky stuff like tech, genre, movies, etc. I had been looking for ways to expand it or cross pollinate with other non-audio based blogs. Sharon ran the idea of <em>Dark Fiction Magazine</em> by me and I was hooked.</p>
<p><strong>Sharon</strong>: I got into book blogging a couple of years ago with<em> <a href="http://darkfictionreview.net/" target="_blank">Dark Fiction Review</a></em>. From there I moved into working as a freelance editor, mostly on horror novels and short stories. <em>Dark Fiction Magazine</em> was an idea I’d had rattling around my head all summer. Turned out, talking to Del, he’d been thinking along the same lines. And that was it: the coolest partnership in podcasting history was born.</p>
<p><strong>What made you want to make <em>Dark Fiction Magazine</em> a podcast instead of a regular, text-based website?</strong></p>
<p>Podcasts have been around since late 1998, but it was not until 2005 that Apple included native support in iTunes, increasing their popularity massively. These days most people will listen to a podcast in some form, be that a BBC iPlayer <em>Listen Again</em>, an audio book or an internet radio station. So to us, this is the perfect growth medium to launch a short fiction site on. There are many text based short story magazines, and a few audio based ones too, but we saw an opportunity in the market to bring a curated monthly magazine offering high quality genre audio fiction to the masses.</p>
<p><strong>How do you see <em>Dark Fiction Magazine</em> </strong><strong>fitting into current landscape of podcasts and free audio fiction? Hugo-winners aside, the UK seems to be lagging a little in the area, with podcasting still dominated by US shows. In particular, free audio fiction in podcast form has been produced Stateside for a long while now – <em>Escape Pod</em> being just one example!</strong></p>
<p>This is a very good question. Both in fandom and publishing, it is a very close knit community. And there are many passionate, selfless people all working together (and apart) to strengthen the community and industry.</p>
<p>When we looked at the current market, we felt that we could add value to the guys and gals already bringing fantastic audio fiction to us. We are UK-centric, certainly, more from circumstance than deliberation, which lets us offer something different and focus more on our audience. We still see ourselves as a global service bringing out stories from authors all over the world.</p>
<p>The liberating thing about being a free service is that the rules of competition and engagement are different. We are not stealing customers from others, as there are more than enough to go round and our service is similar enough to others that any new listener we get is also a potential listener for them. So we are trying to strike that difficult balance of differentiation enough to be intriguing, but not too much where we have nothing to compare ourselves to and align with.</p>
<p><strong>What are your mid- and long-term goals for <em>Dark Fiction Magazine</em>?</strong></p>
<p>To be honest we have been blown away by the positive responses we have had since launch and we are really pleased with how it is going. As for plans going forward, we aim to keep growing our range of stories, authors, narrators and artists while creating a valuable medium for new talent to launch themselves from.</p>
<p>We are also keen to partner with disability charities to ensure their customers get the best access to our free audio stories as possible and we are playing with the idea of expanding the platform into more cutting edge digital experiments. We are all about accessibility, so if there is a way to get great fiction out there, we hope to embrace it.</p>
<p><strong>So, who exactly is <em>Dark Fiction Magazine</em> aimed at? As well as current fiction, will there</strong><strong> be readings of old classics? And are you open to submissions or contributions?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>Dark Fiction Magazine</em> is for absolutely everyone who loves genre fiction. We’re not tied to one genre or sub-genre, so we’re able to podcast lots of content with broad appeal. Our target audience is anyone and everyone. We hope to get sci-fi readers tuning in to horror episodes; fantasy readers listening in to sci-fi. Too often people stick within their own little reading and listening niches. We’re after a wider audience than that. Good genre fiction knows no boundaries, and neither does <em>Dark Fiction Magazine</em>.</p>
<p>We’re interested in submissions from new and established writers but we would ask people to check out our submissions policy first to see whether their material is eligible for submission.</p>
<p>There may be some classic stories read in time. You’ll have to keep an ear out for future episodes to see which of your own favourites make an appearance!</p>
<p><strong> Del and Sharon, thank-you very much!</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.darkfictionmagazine.co.uk/episode/episode1/" target="_blank">Issue 1</a> of <em>Dark Fiction Magazine</em> is available now, and features stories by Gary McMahon, Sarah Pinborough, Joseph D’Lacey, and Conrad Williams.

<p><strong>We Are Ted Tuscadero For President</strong><br />
By Chris Dahlen</p>
<p>My name is Ted Tuscadero. And I want to be your President.</p>
<p>I say that with a humble heart. I realize that even after eight stellar years in the Senate, some of you are still getting to know me. And I’ll admit, I am not perfect. The other day, when I told a VFW in Littleton I would blast Iran to glass, and at the same exact time I swore off the war at a town hall in Concord? My bad. Or the time that three of me showed up for the big debate in Manchester, and we got in a fistfight over who was going on the air? Yeah, the chattering classes had a few laughs over that one.</p>
<p>And that little incident before the holidays, when I crashed, as lit as a Christmas tree, into a pole and my car exploded, killing me instantly and taking a mailbox, a transformer and a barn cat with me? It looked bad, I know. But that proxy was on the fritz. That’s not me. That’s not who I am. And the more we talk, the better you get to know me, the more you’ll see what I mean.</p>

<span id="more-1388"></span></p>
<p>#</p>
<p>I am a lucky man. Of the hundred of me that fanned out across New Hampshire for the presidential primary campaign, I landed in Fairport, a cute spot on the coast. My ex-wife would’ve called it “darling.” I didn’t even know New Hampshire <em>had</em> a coast until they drove me here and got me a room, looking over the harbor, the tugboats, the cobblestone streets. The whole place is loaded with money and photo ops.</p>
<p>I like to think it’s payback for a job well done. For the last six months I’ve been shaking hands, holding town halls, and listening to cranky seniors and eager young back-to-the-earthers. I’ve eaten food on a stick that belonged in the trash. I’ve honed my laugh lines and I’ve sold my vision.</p>
<p>The primary’s in January, and my opponent, Billy LaMontagne, has local roots. Three-time governor of neighboring Maine, well known and well liked in the area, LaMontagne doesn’t use proxies: he’s stumping the state all by himself. But he doesn’t need proxies when everyone with four teeth or fewer knows his face and thinks they can trust it. I&#8217;m the insurgent from New Jersey with everything to prove.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the focus groups say about me: “City slicker.” “Promises anything to anyone.” “Will take away our right to bear arms.” That one really gets me &#8211; LaMontagne likes to wave around an assault rifle during deer season to show all the yokels that he likes red meat and Milwaukee’s worst as much as the rest of them. And fine, next to that, I do look slick. It’s called “owning a comb and a necktie,” and I’ve been doing it since Princeton, thanks.</p>
<p>LaMontagne can crack the screen, I’ll grant him that. When this is all over, he should really get his own line of barbeque sauce. But we’re talking about a national election. The guy has a loose mouth and a small mind and if he gets the nomination, the Republicans won’t even run against him: they’ll kick back and watch him destroy himself. So, this race isn’t just about me. It’s my duty as a loyal Democrat to put this guy down.</p>
<p>But back to me. I have two jobs here in Fairport. First and foremost is the usual campaign stuff &#8211; shake a lot of hands, get a lot of money. But I also have a project. I was explaining it to an eighth-grader the other day. She was doing a thing for her school paper &#8211; which has a teeny readership made up of a totally non-voting audience, but hey, any press is good, and I never talk above an eighth-grade level anyway. We sat in the school gym, with old crumbly murals and the outlines of kids painted on the wall, all kind of round and blank &#8211; probably just the same kid painted over and over.  Above it all flew a giant American flag, and I made sure it was in the shot when she took my picture.</p>
<p>“So, um, Senator Tuscadero -” starts the kid.</p>
<p>“Call me Ted,” I say, flashing my brilliant white teeth.</p>
<p>“Um, I’m not sure how to ask this, but &#8211; are you the real Senator Tuscadero, or -”</p>
<p>“I’m a proxy,” I say, smiling again. I never let anyone feel awkward, especially about this. “I’m one of the hundred proxies in New Hampshire, here for the original Ted Tuscadero, who’s down in D.C. doing the work of the people. The proxies are here to give the people of New Hampshire -”</p>
<p><em>The first-in-the-nation primary voters, who can set me up with that sweet, sweet early momentum</em>, I’m thinking -</p>
<p>“ &#8211; A close look at my governing style, my experience, and my vision for a better America.”</p>
<p>“So you’re called a &#8216;proxy.&#8217; Do you ever call yourselves &#8216;clones&#8217;?”</p>
<p>I laugh again gently. “We could, but we prefer the term &#8216;proxy.&#8217;”  (&#8220;Clone&#8221; tested badly.)</p>
<p>Next we get to why I’m in Fairport: my special project, which will show the voters what a doer and a leader I am.</p>
<p>“So Amy, I’d like to tell you what I’m here to do. You may have heard that Fairport would like to build a windmill. A state-of-the-art, clean green energy solution that would cut your bills and make us safe from the bad guys across the sea.”</p>
<p>Amy nods her head up and down and cocks it to the side, like she’d seen somebody do on TV. Maybe Couric.</p>
<p>“That’s on Parakeet Ave,” she says.</p>
<p>“Exactly. That’s the site they chose. And the trouble is, someone else &#8211; a man named Jim McSmit &#8211; bought the land, and he’d like to put a different business there.”</p>
<p>“A bar?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. A bar.”</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the eighth-grader can’t put in her newspaper: the &#8220;restaurant and bar&#8221; would be called Body Shots. It’s a biker-themed titty bar, dropped right here on the snooty seacoast. The neighbors for a mile around are batshit about this, about how it’ll look, who it’ll draw, the growl of barely-ridden Harleys in the parking lot. But the zoning doesn’t prohibit it. Somebody needs to work out a deal. And that’s what I’m here to do.</p>
<p>My campaign aide, Rachael, subtly taps her watch. Time to wrap this up. I answer a couple more questions and shook my little reporter’s hand. We also give her some pins and a pamphlet for her parents. “TOM TUSCADERO: A <em>REAL</em> LEADER FOR AMERICA.”</p>
<p>“Don’t forget to vote!” I wink at her as they whisk me out the door.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>I’m here with two aides. One is my driver &#8211; after the Christmas crash, we all got drivers &#8211; and the other is Rachael, my aide. Also my lover. And by “lover,” I mean, <em>”yeeeeeeeee-haw.”</em> She has a dual degree in poli-sci and psychology, though I’ll be frank, that’s not the first thing I noticed when they assigned her to me. A slender brunette just out of Swarthmore, she&#8217;s an idealist who still believes in the process. She loves politics. She’s smitten with me, too, and she’s also kind of fascinated by me. She’s drawn to my meteoric career &#8211; but also, to my complex personality.</p>
<p>“What have we got today?” I ask.</p>
<p>“The senior citizens&#8217; center at 10, lunch with the chamber of commerce at noon, and dialing-for-dollars in the afternoon.”</p>
<p>I wince. I hate dialing for dollars. I call everyone I’ve known my whole life and ask them for money. It feels crass, plus, sometimes our lists get mixed up. I’ll end up calling my third-grade English teacher and just as I’m about to reminisce, she tells me that another proxy already rang her up with the same “you walked me to the school nurse” memory. It always makes me feel like a phony.</p>
<p>But before all that, we head downtown. I swing by Main Street at least once a day. Grab a latte from the locally owned café dead center downtown. The same apple Danish: fatty I know, but it’s comfort food and oh boy, the way they bake &#8216;em it’s like an angel crying on your tongue. And then I swing by and spar with the guys at the barbershop. I can always count on five or six voters waiting for a cut. This barber is slower than death.</p>
<p>Joe the barber hates me. He’s a Republican from way back. He probably cast his first vote for Lincoln. Every time I set foot in his shop he greets me the same way: “You cost too goddamn much.”</p>
<p>“Hi Joe,” I say, smiling and winking at his peanut gallery. “What’s the good news today?”</p>
<p>“The radio says they want to make more of you, for the general election,” says Joe. “It’s a waste of taxpayer dollars. We have too many politicians crawling around the country as it is.”</p>
<p>“Well, Joe, as you know, making more proxies is cheap money after the first one.” This is true. When they perfected the cloning process, they found an interesting trick: cloning one person costs … well, it’s a state secret how much it costs, so you can guess how much that is. But the first time you do it, you make a kind of a “mold” &#8211; that’s how they explained it to me, anyway &#8211; and from that mold, you can pour as many copies as you want for a few bucks a shot.</p>
<p>“I’m a bargain, Joe. You get to tell me off in person every day!” I wink.</p>
<p>I take a quick glance to see how the other men react. But I notice that most of them are looking out the window at Rachael, who’s standing outside on her phone. It’s freezing, but she always waits outside at the barbershop.</p>
<p>A little more chitchat, one more winning smile and I’m moving on.</p>
<p>I’m starting to think I know this town better than the one where I live. I know where to get the best martini and the freshest lobster roll. I can practically count the votes here by name.</p>
<p>“You know what, Rach? When I’m done with the White House, we should come back here. I would make a really good Mayor.”</p>
<p>“First things first, Senator,” she says, and steers me back to the car.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Back at the hotel, I get out of the shower to see Rachael tapping at her laptop. She snaps it closed as soon as she hears me.</p>
<p>“Bad news in the polls?” I ask, smiling &#8211; not my politician smile, but my real one. Only Rachael gets the real one.</p>
<p>“Yes, but not in yours. I was actually reading about the Republicans. Word is, Governor Kewt just got himself a sex scandal.”</p>
<p>“Hot damn! Was he caught with a dead girl? A live boy? <em>Both</em>?”</p>
<p>“Daughter of a senator &#8211; scratch that, <em>two</em> daughters &#8211; and they let it slip on Twitter. They get a book deal, he’s down for the count.”</p>
<p>That’s it! The Republicans are done! Kewt&#8217;s the only candidate they had this year who could walk down the street without wearing out his knuckles. I feel relief and desire and <em>lust</em>. I have this thing in the <em>bag</em>. I can picture myself … well, um, <em>yeah</em>, myself … walking into the Oval Office and dropping my loafers right on the top of that desk.</p>
<p>She responds to my smile. She loves this game, almost as much as I do. I know what you’re probably thinking: I picked her as my aide because <em>va-vooom</em>. But believe me, I’m lucky to have her. She’s been working on campaigns since junior high. This is her first real gig on a national campaign, and she already acts like a vet. I would be lost without her.</p>
<p>And I’d be lost on nights like this, too. Back in Washington I was out every night and on the phone the minute I got home. I’d call old friends, new colleagues, people I had to cajole, constituents who thought I’d never remember their names. I loved to talk to people. But now that I’m … well, I can’t really do that now. None of us proxies are allowed to make casual calls, and these aren’t “my” friends anymore. It would creep people out.</p>
<p>But Rachael? Rachael is all mine.</p>
<p>“We have to get up in five hours,” she says, pulling me into bed.</p>
<p>“So let’s get three hours of sleep.”</p>
<p>“If you’re lucky I’ll make it one.”</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>And so I’m tired and not in the mood the next morning when my phone rings. It was someone I didn’t want to talk to, and I had to schlep all the way outside to meet him.</p>
<p>I pull on some clothes and go to the street to find Harry Angler idling at the curb, in a rental car, his window halfway down. A doughy guy with a potato-shaped head and a comb-over like bent hay, he had, as always, no facial expression whatsoever. And here he is, getting <em>me</em> up first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>Angler’s the guy who gets stuff done for me in D.C. When I first found him, early in my career, he was just a two-bit election-fixer working for dead-end campaigns. You know the racket &#8211; running push polls to make the other guy sound like Hitler’s lost grandson, or spreading photos of an uptight Christian blitzed at a gay bar. Angler didn’t have much of a resume. But I saw something there I could use, and now he works for me – I mean, the original me, the me in D.C. &#8211; on all of my campaigns.</p>
<p>That also means he’s in charge of the proxies. He swings by to check in on me every couple of weeks. I used to have him on the phone twenty times a day, and now I only get time with him when he feels like showing up.</p>
<p>“Harry, hi,” I say, leaning casually on the window. He just pushes a poll in my hand. “This is confidential from the campaign.”</p>
<p>I skim the pages. “I don’t see any surprises.”</p>
<p>“LaMontagne&#8217;s gaining ground with 50-65 year old divorcees. You have a lot of those here, no?”</p>
<p><em>Could you at least turn off the car so I don’t have to talk over your engine?</em></p>
<p>“Oh sure, I’m working their votes,” I say. “And listen, I also made some headway on the windmill project -”</p>
<p>“That’s good. We have no room for error here. And don’t forget, Windswept Industries needs that thing built, or the money they’re sending us is gone.”</p>
<p>We chitchat a little more, but I can tell he’s eager to move on. <em>Dammit</em>, I think, <em>would you treat me &#8211; the original me &#8211; this way? How would me-in-D.C. act if he saw you act like this?</em></p>
<p>But again, I didn’t say anything. Because hard as it is to admit, I need him.</p>
<p>Sounding casual, I ask: “Listen, so, any movement on the leaderboard?”</p>
<p>“The leaderboard&#8217;s always moving,” he answered.</p>
<p>“So how am I doing?”</p>
<p>“You’ve done great work here,” says Angler. “Great work. And we expect even more.” And that’s all I get out of him before he leaves.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>“Can I ask you a question?” says Joe the barber, a straight razor over my temple.</p>
<p>“Shoot,” I say. I was there, for once, to get an actual haircut, and we had the shop to ourselves. Seeing Angler’s scruffy dome made me want to get my own cleaned up. Have to look my best for all those lonely old women whose votes weren’t in the bag.</p>
<p>“You’re Ted Tuscadero, and there’s Senator Ted Tuscadero down in Washington. And then there are ninety-nine more of you running around.”</p>
<p>“That’s the headcount.” Well, it’s a hundred minus the one we lost on Christmas. And I think Rachael said another one just “dropped out.” I’m not sure what that means-I was eavesdropping.</p>
<p>“So when this election’s over, what do you all do?”</p>
<p>“Well, during the election as you know, I’ll be traveling the country for the campaign. After that? We’ll still represent the President, and push his agenda. You remember when people joked that President Obama was -everywhere- whenever he had something to push. I can really do it.”</p>
<p>“So you stay on the road, while the first Senator goes to the White House?”</p>
<p>I know I shouldn’t tell him. But I can’t resist.</p>
<p>“Here’s the thing,” I say, lowering my tone. “We have something called the -leaderboard.- It’s how we rank all the proxies.”</p>
<p>Joe is shaving me now, getting things oh-so-smooth around my ear.</p>
<p>“The way it works, when you help the campaign, you move up. If you screw up, you move down. The proxies near the top get the choice assignments. And when the election’s over, the top one gets &#8211; well, I shouldn’t say.”</p>
<p>“Let me guess. You get some time in the White House?”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” I answer. “The original Ted can take long vacations while I stay in Washington. I get to share power with myself.”</p>
<p>Joe thinks it over, but he doesn’t seem convinced. “I dunno. He’s you. You’re him. Would you give up the top seat? For even one single day?”</p>
<p>He catches me for a second. But I shoot him an easy smile and say, “Well, I do like my vacations.”</p>
<p>Joe laughs. Score.</p>
<p>“I know you think you’re doing us voters a favor. But the thing is, people don’t like politicians,” says Joe. “We only like &#8216;em at their funerals.”</p>
<p>“I care about the windmill. And I care about this town. You see me every day!”</p>
<p>“Ted, if you lived here, I’d hate you year-round!”</p>
<p>“Maybe you just don’t know me well enough,” I grin.</p>
<p>On my way out the door, my cell phone rings. I have to take this call: it’s none other than Jim McSmit, the guy whose nudie bar stands between me and the White House. He suggests we meet for lunch. Rachael had been working for days to set this up, and now he calls me, and names the restaurant. It’s not the one I would’ve picked &#8211; but only because I’m not a member. Yet.</p>
<p>McSmit meets me at the 10 Congress Club. It’s a swank new social club, with a membership fee in the thousands and a line of old and new money waiting to pay. McSmit, shall we say, is “new money.” One look at the guy and you hid your wallet. Beady eyes squinted between a smooth-shaved dome and a bushy handlebar moustache, and his leather jacket was filthy. First thing he warned me: “Don’t swear in here. They’ll fucking fine you.”</p>
<p>My goal here was to see if we could settle this at a cost the city council could swallow. And it wasn’t starting well. We started off on his turf, on his clock, and he knew that he had what I needed.</p>
<p>“Here’s my thing,” he says. “I’m just a guy making a living on beer, tits and wings. Not a Washington big shot like you.”</p>
<p>“Hey, I think I know a little more about your situation than you’d think,” I correct him. “I ran a small business myself.”</p>
<p>“Yeah? What was that?”</p>
<p>“My law practice.”</p>
<p>McSmit scoffs, at that but I ignore him. “I was a trial lawyer. Win a case, and you’re rich; lose, and you just wasted a year on nothing. I know what American businessmen put on the line.”</p>
<p>“What I’ve heard, you won plenty of cases. Did pretty well for yourself. Why’d you even get into politics? What do they pay you in the Senate?”</p>
<p>“It’s not really about the pay,” I say, realizing no one ever really asks me about this. “I love it for the same reason I love a trial. I love going into a court and <em>persuading</em> people &#8211; because that’s half the battle, not just having the facts and the evidence, but convincing them you’re their guy. I’m good at that. Put me in front of anyone, face to face, and I can get them to hear me out. And when they do, they usually agree with me.”</p>
<p>McSmit cuts me off. “Don’t count on getting any agreement from me. Seems you just came here to tell me to get out of town. And nobody tells me that. Ever.”</p>
<p>Tough talk. But I’ve heard tougher.  “Okay. Then what <em>should</em> I tell you?”</p>
<p>“What’ll you give me if I nix the restaurant?”</p>
<p>I laugh. “I’m not writing you a check, if that’s what you’re getting at. Election officials take offense at that kind of thing.”</p>
<p>“I’m not fucking slow, I know you can’t just -give- me something. But even if you lose the race, you’re a fucking Senator. A favor from you could be worth something. And anyway, LaMontagne&#8217;s people have been dragging their dicks in the sand about what <em>they&#8217;ll</em> do for me.”</p>
<p>This surprises me. “You’re saying LaMontagne&#8217;s backing you up on this?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah, I talk to some of his people. He doesn’t talk to me directly, like you. There aren’t as many of him, so his time’s worth a lot more.” His grin went halfway to a snarl.</p>
<p>“LaMontagne will never make it to the White House. If I win here, I win the White House. And I will remember the people who helped me along the way.”</p>
<p>McSmit goes silent. He swirls his drink around. “Well, that’s fucking sweet, but what can you do for me down there? LaMontagne&#8217;s right over in Maine. Lots of girls in Maine want to work for a Body Shots, ‘specially in this economy. Lots of local talent up there. You know they have a topless donut shop up near the capital?”</p>
<p>“So I guess you’re saying you don’t want me to go to Washington and save the economy,” I joke. That gets a genuine laugh out of him, and for a second there, I don’t want to kill the guy.</p>
<p>But by the time the tab comes, I know we’re done here. And he hammers it in as he reaches for the tab and looks at the fines that the maitre d- was quietly ticking up every time he opened his stupid mouth.</p>
<p>“Sorry I can’t help you. But hey, I’m the one who spent $240 to tell you what’s on my mind.”</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>“What’s plan B?” Rachael asks back at the hotel, where I don’t even feel like sex.</p>
<p>I sigh. “We can try to seize the lot through eminent domain, but that’s a scorched earth approach. It’s bound to tick off voters left, right, and center.” I groan. “Maybe I can find another buyer for the land.”</p>
<p>“But LaMontagne will find a way to block you,” she says. And that stings. Here’s LaMontagne, playing his pawns against me while he won’t even stoop to sit at the chessboard.</p>
<p>“When I get into office, I’m going to move so much nuclear waste to his state that that fucker won’t need lights on the highway.”</p>
<p>“I love it when you talk all tough,” Rachael laughs. She walks into the other room to pour a couple of drinks.</p>
<p>Her laptop is open, and I glance over and see a poll on her screen. I’ve never seen this one before. It isn’t a poll of the primary, or the likely nominees. It isn’t an issues poll, either. It’s a poll I’ve never seen before &#8211; a poll about proxies.</p>
<p>“Do you support the use of proxies to reach out to voters?” asked the first question. 63% said yes. Okay, that’s nice. The voters still like the personal touch.</p>
<p>“Recently, the federal government revealed the true price of the program. Do you think it’s worth the expense?” Hey, that was news &#8211; I didn’t realize the cost had leaked. Doesn’t anyone know how to keep a state secret anymore? And here, the numbers look bad: 3% thought it was worth the money, 2% were not sure. Everyone else was totally pissed off.</p>
<p>Well, okay, people hate it when you spend their money. But come on, we can spin this. I just catch the next question, which looked like it had something to do with my car crash last December. “Given the controversy over the cost, the ethical issues, and the public safety risks, do you believe the proxy program should-”</p>
<p>And then I hear Rachael padding back into the bedroom. Skilled from years of surfing porn at the office, I flick the window back in time and slide away from the computer.</p>
<p>“What’s up?” she asks.</p>
<p>“Planning my next move on the Body Shots situation.” With a heavy sigh I say, “This is going to get ugly. Rach, I’m going to need to talk to Harry Angler tomorrow. Can you get me on the phone with him?”</p>
<p>The minute the name leaves my lips, I know I’ve screwed up.</p>
<p>See, Rachael’s an idealist. A world saver. She used to spend spring break walking girls past the mobs at abortion clinics. She hears me bring up Angler’s name, and she know exactly what I have in mind.</p>
<p>“You don’t have any other ideas?”</p>
<p>“Nope. None. I can’t do this the right way. But I can still get it done.”</p>
<p>Her eyes get hard &#8211; she’s giving me idealist eyes. “You know I joined this campaign because I know you can be a good man. That’s what matters to me. You’re here to do right, and this isn’t right.”</p>
<p>“Rachael, sometimes the ends justify the -”</p>
<p>She cuts that off with a wave of her hand. “Don’t bullshit me.”</p>
<p>So I speak to her as honestly as I know how. “I don’t have a choice here, Rach. I really don’t have a choice. If I slip on the leaderboard, if I don’t deliver this town &#8211; I’m finished. Just finished. You think I don’t know have my own questions about how this thing works? Do you think I really believe that the bottom ten guys are getting ambassadorships?</p>
<p>“And,” I added after a thought, “Regardless. I didn’t come this far to give up. That’s not who I am.”</p>
<p>We don’t talk the rest of that night. The last time I see her is when she drops my blanket and pillow on the couch. But I can handle that. Give it time, and she’ll see my point of view.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>The next week was very convenient for me.</p>
<p>McSmit made the papers: while driving back from a meeting to look at plans for an ice luge, McSmit started driving erratically. He totaled his Mustang on the lawn of a historic house, pulverizing a 17th century birdbath. And what should the cops find in the glove compartment but a tiny bag with a few snorts of cocaine. The legal bill will be staggering. Selling the lot for Body Shots is a given.</p>
<p>By the time of the primary, we had a deal. The Council voted for it; the windmill company gave them a special price for a pilot program. Even Rachael started to warm back up to me. She isn’t happy about McSmit &#8211; no mistaking that &#8211; but hey, green energy is one of her issues. Technically, this is a win.</p>
<p>I won the primary, too. The state was close, but I had a landslide margin in Fairport. And I made the top of the proxy leaderboard. I should’ve been over the moon.</p>
<p>But somehow I don’t feel finished with this place. In fact, to tell the truth? It feels like the town is finished with me.</p>
<p>On primary night, I stood outside the polling place at the middle school, shaking hands at the gym. On the way in, everyone shook my hand and promised to give me their vote. And on the way out, they kept saying goodbye &#8211; like they were never going to see me again.</p>
<p>My campaign party felt like a wake. At the Mayor came, and he gave me a beefy handshake. “Ted, we’re really pleased about this project,” he says. “And hey, I know you’ll be busy in the White House next spring. But is there any way you could come back for the groundbreaking? It’s your baby, and we’d love to take your photo with it.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t miss it,” I say, smiling. “But listen. In case I’m busy. Could we take the photo with -” I didn’t know how to put this. “Like, could you take a picture of me for this?”</p>
<p>“Ted, we haven’t even broken ground yet -”</p>
<p>I blurt it out. “If I come back this fall, well &#8211; I don’t know if it’ll be me. <em>Me</em> me. You know?”</p>
<p>The Mayor suddenly got my meaning. He stopped, and we had an awkward moment. But it was just a moment. He’s a pol, and he knows how to come right back to the comfort zone. With a cough and a smile, he claps me on the back and says, “Ted? It’ll be you and me and the Secret Service and all your friends in Fairport. And we will welcome you back.”</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>My last day in Fairport, I decide to get my hair cut.</p>
<p>Naturally I go to Joe’s. I wanted to say goodbye, and rib him a little for not voting for me. Rachael said she’d meet me here as soon as the cars packed, and then we’re off to D.C. for our next assignment.</p>
<p>“Ted, I didn’t vote for you, that’s true. You’re on the wrong ticket,” says Joe. “But I’ve gotta say, you lived up to your word. You said you’d build that ridiculous windmill and saddle us all with debt, and you did it.”</p>
<p>“It’ll save money in the long run,” I remind him as he changed clippers.</p>
<p>“Remains to be seen.”</p>
<p>“I’ll come back and find out,” I smile. Damn was I feeling home sick already, and we hadn’t even pulled out of town.</p>
<p>Joe is silent for a while. “So, what’s next for you?” he asks, and he sounds a little funny.</p>
<p>“They haven’t told me. But I have a feeling it’s gonna be great,” I say.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m curious what’s next. Just because the election’s in the bag doesn’t mean we can stop working. Maybe they’ll send me to California – the big prize. I love the weather. And one of me isn’t enough for a state that big. Maybe I’ll get more proxies, working under me – a hundred of them canvassing the state, and I would coordinate them all. In fact, I wonder if I can give each of them a Rachael.</p>
<p>I look out the window to see if Rachael’s brought the car. And then I spot something: a van pulls up outside, and a man in a rumbled trench coat slouches out. It’s Angler.</p>
<p>“What’s in the paper,” I ask, “any good news?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Nah. Nothing you should worry about. You just won big, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>Angler walks in, and I get a feeling in my gut &#8211; the feeling I get when I’m about to be ambushed by a reporter, or sunk in a debate, or just when I shouldn’t take a call. I get a feeling that I should excuse myself. But there’s nowhere to go.</p>
<p>“Senator,” he says, “come with me.”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute. His haircut’s not done,” Joe objects. He puts a hand on my shoulder. Angler doesn’t even look at him.</p>
<p>“Time to go, Senator.”</p>
<p>I nod to Joe and stand. I offer to pay, but Joe shakes his head. “On the house.”</p>
<p>“Well, thanks Joe. I really appreciate that.”</p>
<p>And for the first time, he extends his hand. We shake. “Best of luck to you, Senator,” he says. And as I leave the shop and get in the van, I feel good. I could swear I almost have his vote.</p>

We Are Ted Tuscadero For President
By Chris Dahlen

My name is Ted Tuscadero. And I want to be your President.

I say that with a humble heart. I realize that even after eight stellar years in the Senate, some of you are still getting to know me. And Irsquo;ll admit, I am not perfect. The other day, when I told a VFW in Littleton I would blast Iran to glass, and at the same exact time I swore off the war at a town hall in Concord? My bad. Or the time that three of me showed up for the big debate in Manchester, and we got in a fistfight over who was going on the air? Yeah, the chattering classes had a few laughs over that one.

And that little incident before the holidays, when I crashed, as lit as a Christmas tree, into a pole and my car exploded, killing me instantly and taking a mailbox, a transformer and a barn cat with me? It looked bad, I know. But that proxy was on the fritz. Thatrsquo;s not me. Thatrsquo;s not who I am. And the more we talk, the better you get to know me, the more yoursquo;ll see what I mean.

Keep reading...


#

I am a lucky man. Of the hundred of me that fanned out across New Hampshire for the presidential primary campaign, I landed in Fairport, a cute spot on the coast. My ex-wife wouldrsquo;ve called it ldquo;darling.rdquo; I didnrsquo;t even know New Hampshire had a coast until they drove me here and got me a room, looking over the harbor, the tugboats, the cobblestone streets. The whole place is loaded with money and photo ops.

I like to think itrsquo;s payback for a job well done. For the last six months Irsquo;ve been shaking hands, holding town halls, and listening to cranky seniors and eager young back-to-the-earthers. Irsquo;ve eaten food on a stick that belonged in the trash. Irsquo;ve honed my laugh lines and Irsquo;ve sold my vision.

The primaryrsquo;s in January, and my opponent, Billy LaMontagne, has local roots. Three-time governor of neighboring Maine, well known and well liked in the area, LaMontagne doesnrsquo;t use proxies: hersquo;s stumping the state all by himself. But he doesnrsquo;t need proxies when everyone with four teeth or fewer knows his face and thinks they can trust it. I'm the insurgent from New Jersey with everything to prove.

Here's what the focus groups say about me: ldquo;City slicker.rdquo; ldquo;Promises anything to anyone.rdquo; ldquo;Will take away our right to bear arms.rdquo; That one really gets me - LaMontagne likes to wave around an assault rifle during deer season to show all the yokels that he likes red meat and Milwaukeersquo;s worst as much as the rest of them. And fine, next to that, I do look slick. Itrsquo;s called ldquo;owning a comb and a necktie,rdquo; and Irsquo;ve been doing it since Princeton, thanks.

LaMontagne can crack the screen, Irsquo;ll grant him that. When this is all over, he should really get his own line of barbeque sauce. But wersquo;re talking about a national election. The guy has a loose mouth and a small mind and if he gets the nomination, the Republicans wonrsquo;t even run against him: theyrsquo;ll kick back and watch him destroy himself. So, this race isnrsquo;t just about me. Itrsquo;s my duty as a loyal Democrat to put this guy down.

But back to me. I have two jobs here in Fairport. First and foremost is the usual campaign stuff - shake a lot of hands, get a lot of money. But I also have a project. I was explaining it to an eighth-grader the other day. She was doing a thing for her school paper - which has a teeny readership made up of a totally no...</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a writer and consumer of genre fiction, now should be the perfect time of year for me, right? After all, Halloween is just around the corner<a href="#jr_halloween_1">*</a><em> [Ed note: Mur was very bad in getting this up, so consider Halloween having just passed us by...] </em>and every sci-fi blog, podcast, and show is extolling the virtues of Halloween.</p>
<p>To me, though, Halloween&#8230; just doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>Now, maybe when my daughter is a little older and she starts going door-to-door asking for donations of unhealthy food<a href="#jr_halloween_2">**</a> while wearing an amusing costume, I might care a little more. I might also care more if more trick-or-treaters came to my door, but I think we get an average of five per year. I&#8217;ve taken to putting out a bowl and being done with the matter.</p>
<p>Halloween holds no special place in my heart. Which is weird, because I write some pretty dark, disturbing fiction when the mood strikes. But I don&#8217;t care about costumes, decorations, scary movies being more relevant now than in February or June, candy (except Nerds Rope, which is awesome), or parties. I don&#8217;t dress up (I might wear a funny wig to work), I don&#8217;t gorge myself on sweets, I don&#8217;t watch <i>The Ring</i> or listen to a reading of &#8220;The Cask of Amontillado&#8221;. This year I&#8217;ll probably be asleep before the trick-or-treaters even arrive because I have to be at work before 6am the next day.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just being old and crotchety. I&#8217;ve never crocheted in my life. In college, I didn&#8217;t make it a point to go to Halloween parties. When I was a kid, I trick-or-treated, but I wasn&#8217;t one of those who kept it up as a teenager. I stopped dressing up at about age 11, and that was that. </p>
<p>I just don&#8217;t see the point of making such a big deal out of a holiday that you don&#8217;t even get off of work or school. Maybe that makes me weird, or an outcast in the community, but I can&#8217;t be the <i>only</i> genre person who doesn&#8217;t care that October 31 is supposed to mean candy, costumes, parties, and scary media &#8212; I think we were all really sick of <i>ER</i>&#8216;s Halloween episodes after a couple of seasons.</p>
<p>These days, sadly, Halloween exists to sell stuff, and so the media can trot out their &#8220;razor blade in the candy&#8221; and &#8220;check over your kid&#8217;s trick-or-treat bag&#8221; stories that they&#8217;ve been brushing off for the past few decades. Good space fillers. Good ways to sell things people don&#8217;t really need to eat. Good for kids (unless their parents object to the holiday, which kind of makes &#8220;write your favorite Halloween memory in your writing journal today&#8221; assignments pretty hard).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry. I don&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p>Go and have your fun this Halloween. Enjoy your movies, and your candy, and your parties, and dressing up like Sexy Elmo, or Sexy Avatar Blue Person, or Sexy Chilean Miner&#8217;s Wife, or just your average angel or devil. Spend your money, consume your media, enjoy the hell out of it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be sleeping.</p>
<p><a name="jr_halloween_1">*</a> <i>Or, at least, it was when I wrote this. I&#8217;ve been woefully delinquent lately.</i></p>
<p><a name="jr_halloween_2">**</a> <i>Come to think of it, most canned food collected in food drives is absurdly high in sodium, which isn&#8217;t good for you either.</i></p>

<p><strong>Saint Darwin’s Spirituals</strong><br />
By D.K. Thompson</p>
<p>The ghosts wanted a threesome – the two of them in Lucy’s body. It wasn’t an unheard of proposition, or so Lucy had been told. Prostitutes considered psychic whoring one of the safest tricks on the streets. All the pleasures of intimacy without the messy clean-up.</p>
<p>Ghosts had a nasty reputation for vanishing the moment after, though, no matter the talisman around your neck or the potion drunk before sunset, and so payments were usually collected up front. Not that Lucy was worried about the money. Her husband was the only thing that concerned her.</p>
<p>She adjusted her brass and leather goggles, peering through the ethereal tinted lenses to examine the ghosts.</p>
<p>They looked like the average apparitions. Both female. One spiraled around Lucy, long and curly hair obscuring her face. Large black blotches covered her body, causing her skin to peel off in patches. The other hovered several feet above the cobblestones in front of Lucy. She had a noose around her throat and her neck was bent so her head hung to the left side. She crossed her arms and took several breaths. Or whatever passed for breaths in the afterlife.<br />
<em><br />
How long had it been since they’d felt someone’s touch? </em>Lucy wondered. She remembered something her husband had told her long ago, before the murders, before he’d disappeared. “Spirits linger in this world longing to be a part of it, to reconnect, to have some kind of physical, sensual experience,” Thomas had said. “Only a host can provide them that.”</p>
<p><em>Ghosts aren’t the only creatures haunted by the memory of a touch, my love,</em> Lucy thought. And yet, despite being a devout spiritualist, she shuddered at the idea of the cadaverous spirits making love inside her. She’d never had a ghostgasm before, much less been paid for one. The ghosts looked sincere in their desire, not like dangerous murderers. Certainly not monsters. Still, lonely as she was, a ghostgasm wouldn’t help her find Thomas.</p>

<p><span id="more-1336"></span></p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s a good idea, Rose,” said the ghost spinning around Lucy. The air trailing behind her churned like water in a boat’s wake.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, love?” Rose asked, winding the noose’s end around her wrist. “She look a bit too practiced for your tastes, Ethel?”</p>
<p>Lucy felt her cheeks flush. She pulled her shawl over her shoulders and took several small breaths, all her tight corset allowed. “To be honest, I don’t service the dead.” It sounded so insulting, but she couldn’t tell them the truth.</p>
<p>Ethel came to a halt an arm’s-length from Lucy’s face. “I’ve never heard of a whore who had much use for honesty.”</p>
<p>“A whore’s a whore,” said Rose. “We need a rental and our money’s honest, if nothing else is.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” Lucy said. “I meant no offense. But you should find someone else. I’m not quite ready for that kind of…spiritual<br />
experience.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Ethel. “We’ll just have to find a more enlightened whore, then.”</p>
<p>Before Lucy could respond, Ethel turned and shot down the street, passing through a carriage, and eliciting a curse from the coachman as his horses bucked and whinnied.</p>
<p>“You might as well have walked over her grave,” said Rose, fingers clenching the frayed rope. “Sorry we wasted your time.”</p>
<p>“I <em>am</em> sorry,” Lucy sighed. “But I’m really not the one you want to make love to.”</p>
<p>“Too true. I don’t think she fancied the thought of using you, anyway,” said Rose. “Listen, you seem like a nice girl. Why don’t you look me up in Westminster some time? After you’re dead, of course.”</p>
<p>“I’ll consider it,” Lucy said politely, trying not to stare at the noose. “Although I don’t think you’re my type.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you never know, love. Death can be very liberating,” Rose said with a wink. “But I’d rather you live a long life before becoming familiar with it. Best get off the streets. It’s getting late and it’s a nasty night. I don’t want to see you ‘round my area in the near future.” The ghost zoomed off in the direction Ethel had gone, the air shimmering behind her.</p>
<p>Lucy glanced down the dark, empty cobblestone streets. The carriage Ethel had flown through started moving again, clattering hooves echoing in the night air. She flipped out her pocket watch and eyed the time. Still early.</p>
<p>No one else propositioned Lucy for the next half-hour as she wandered Whitechapel, which suited her just fine. There were several prostitutes working, some stood alone under the hissing gas-lit street lamps, others talked with prospective clients, and one Lucy saw contorting on the alleyway floor in the thralls of a ghostgasm. Through the dark glass of her goggles, she could see the spirits twisting inside the prostitute, making love as the host writhed and moaned on the ground. The prostitute’s goggles magnified her blank stare. Had Ethel and Rose found an acceptable host?</p>
<p>Lucy peeled off her goggles. Everything looked the same as it had before, except she could no longer see the ghosts, just the squirming prostitute who looked like she was having a seizure. Lucy quickened her pace, her footfalls drowning out the groans behind her. She rounded the corner and bumped into a golem deputy, its solid clay frame knocking her off balance. It glanced at her, yellow eyes dancing from the flames lit inside his mouth, then continued to trudge down the street.</p>
<p>When the church bells struck midnight, Lucy sat on a bench, kicked off her shoes to rub her feet, and stared at the statue of Saint Charles Darwin in the center of the courtyard. His trademark invention, a pair of goggles, covered his eyes. He sat in his chair and seemed to look down at her, clutching his _Origin of the Species_ essay in one hand and his _Origin of the Spirits_ in the other, as if pondering their implications.</p>
<p><em>Don’t look at me like that,</em> she thought. <em>Sometimes I wish you hadn’t invented these damned things. Sometimes I feel so small and insignificant when I see through your lenses.</em></p>
<p>The bells finished ringing with a hollow sound. Lucy twisted her goggles in her hands and thought about how alone she was, how alone they all seemed to be. She wondered what had happened to Thomas.</p>
<p>It stayed quiet and dark for a long time. Finally, Lucy began toward home. She considered a different route to avoid the prostitute but decided her business must have surely concluded.</p>
<p>No moans echoed from the same alley so Lucy glanced down it. She stopped at what she saw, rooted to the ground.</p>
<p>The prostitute floated in the air, shuddering. The front of her emerald corset wet. The woman’s empty gaze stared past Lucy. Her goggles had shattered on the cobblestones.</p>
<p>Lucy tried to steady her breathing and pulled her goggles back on, looking for a sign of the ghost clients.</p>
<p>Something flickered inside the prostitute’s body. Her eyes and nostrils and mouth seemed to glow. Transfixed, Lucy continued to stare. She’d never seen anything like this before.</p>
<p>High-pitched clattering filled the alley, like the blades of hundreds of knives screeching across metal plates. Then a pair of tentacles jutted through the woman’s chest, splitting it open and streaking her clothes with blood and gore and that same pale, flickering light.</p>
<p>Lucy staggered backwards, covered her mouth with her hands, and looked up. A dark shape hung above the prostitute, perched on a windowsill, wrapping its tentacles around the dead girl’s body.</p>
<p><em>The monster,</em> Lucy thought. <em>Jesus God, at last.</em> She’d played this scene out over and over in her imagination since Thomas had disappeared. But watching it splatter blood and entrails across the alley, Lucy went cold. She took a deep breath, lifted her dress, and unstrapped the single-chamber pistol from her thigh. Swallowed. Tried to steady her trembling, sweating hand.</p>
<p>Light pulsed inside the prostitute. Tentacles dug inside her. Then a sick, wet sound of something being pulped, and a shimmering form was yanked out. A woman. A moaning, eviscerated woman, clutching her wounds.</p>
<p>Lucy caught her breath, said a prayer for the prostitute’s spirit, then fired.</p>
<p>In the flare of the shot, the creature’s body was illuminated, a thorax, covered with hundreds of gleaming mouths. Not a rogue vampire, as the papers had speculated. At least not like any Lucy had seen. Then what the devil <em>was</em> it?</p>
<p>The creature shrieked, so loud, Lucy almost dropped her pistol to cover her ears. The prostitute’s body fell headfirst to the ground, her skull cracking open across the pavement, dashing blood and bits of brain over Lucy.</p>
<p>She took a step back and pulled another round from her pocket. The bullet slipped through her fingers and slid between the cobblestones. She reached for another. Slid it into the chamber and shoved it closed. Aimed.</p>
<p>Too late.</p>
<p>The monster had vanished into the night. Lucy panted and knelt beside the dead prostitute, looked for her spirit. Nothing.</p>
<p>She covered her face with her hands, panting and blinking back tears. She’d seen it. She’d come so close. And she’d let it escape.</p>
<p>Bells sounded in the distance, higher-pitched than the church’s. The Paranormal Patrol.</p>
<p>Lucy wiped her palms on her dress, drying the sweat.</p>
<p>The patrol rounded the corner, bells ringing fast and loud. A pair of golems trotted beside the carriage, their dull gleaming eyes surveying the street. They hadn’t seen her, not yet. Lucy sprang to her feet and into the alley.</p>
<p>A shrill whistle sounded and heavy footsteps pounded behind her – the golems, picking up speed. The lenses of her goggles fogged. She pulled them down where they bounced against her neck as she ran, pistol clutched in hand. She wouldn’t kill a human constable, she’d rather turn herself in and face the consequences. But she had no qualms shooting a golem. They weren’t alive to begin with.</p>
<p>Steam poured from ventilation shafts on the walls, blinding her. More than once, she glanced up at the rooftops, hoping to get a trace of the creature.</p>
<p>A golem lurched out at her through the steam curtain, arms opened wide. She bounced off its chest and hit the ground.</p>
<p>The constable picked her up, its massive grey arms damp and sweating from the heat, and flung her against the brick wall. She landed in a puddle that smelled of piss and vomit, bits of clay sticking to her skin and clothes where the golem had touched her. Lucy rolled to her side, leveled her pistol at the golem and fired. Clay exploded around its chest and the golem flinched from the force of the shot, but its eyes maintained that yellow gleam as it lumbered toward her.</p>
<p>She reached for another bullet. The golem stretched out its giant, wet hands toward her.</p>
<p>“That’s enough!” shouted someone above her. “Stand down, constable!”</p>
<p>The golem froze. Lucy fell back against the wall, tugged her goggles back on to see a pair of spirits descend through the night air toward them.</p>
<p>“Police!” shouted one of the ghosts. “Stay where you are!”</p>
<p>Lucy caught her breath as Ethel and Rose descended beside her, feet hovering over the ground, both of them frowning.</p>
<p>Rose crossed her arms. “You again?”</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>“You two are police?” Lucy asked. “But you solicited me! You wanted to have sex with me!”</p>
<p>“Not with you, with each other,” Rose said. “You were just a warm body.”</p>
<p>“We’re paranormal officers,” Ethel explained. “We’ve been trying to find this monster before it killed again.”</p>
<p>Lucy blinked. She hadn’t heard of any police involvement.</p>
<p>“And instead of it, we found you, assaulting an officer of the law,” said Rose. “Right after fleeing a murder scene. What’s a whore like you doing walking the streets this late with a pistol?”</p>
<p>“Working,” Lucy said. “It’s become something of a dangerous profession.”</p>
<p>“Come off it,” Rose said. “You’re no prostitute. What are you doing dressed like one? Don’t you realize something’s out there killing girls?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Yes, I do.”</p>
<p>“What are you?” Ethel asked. “A nutter? A vigilante?”</p>
<p>She looked down at her clothes and the pistol in her hand, biting her lip. The ghosts and the golem continued to watch her, but she didn’t know how to answer them. What <em>was</em> she doing? Was she any closer to finding out what happened to Thomas?</p>
<p>Lucy closed her eyes, took a breath, then spoke through gritted teeth. “I’m a widow and a spiritualist. That’s all you need to know. Now, get out of my way.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid that won’t do,” said Rose. “We’re short on time. If you won’t provide us with answers, we’ll have to find other ways of asking our questions.” And before Lucy could mutter any incantations or use a talisman against her, Rose dove into her body.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Lucy staggered, saw images from her past being splayed out and dissected in her mind’s eye, felt Rose’s thin, transparent fingers smudging her thoughts and memories, sifting through anything that looked significant to her.</p>
<p>Thomas was there. Telling her about the reports he’d received: prostitutes whose deaths didn’t concern the police. He took the matter into his own hands, like a good spiritualist, hoping to learn about and document this new creature, hoping to save lives by understanding it. He started spending nights on the streets, armed with goggles, talismans, enchantments, and a pistol. He questioned prostitutes and their pimps, tried to figure out what was killing the girls and why.</p>
<p>Lucy saw herself sitting in the kitchen, waiting for him to return. He’d walk in the door, dark circles sagging under his eyes, and talk for hours about the monster roaming the streets. How it stayed in the shadows, eviscerated its victims in a mess of blood and pulp, their ghosts never appearing.</p>
<p>He was out every night in the company of prostitutes. They argued. So often, so long, and hard, they eventually stopped talking. Thomas went days between coming home.</p>
<p>Then, after a week-long absence, Lucy realized he wasn’t coming home.</p>
<p>Rose trampled through it all, clouding Lucy’s memories. Every moment with Thomas, every argument they had, every time they made love. In that lifetime of seconds, Thomas seemed closer than ever, and yet Rose hovered above every instance, staring. Prying.</p>
<p>Lucy wanted to scream.</p>
<p>They stood in the alley watching the prostitute’s ghostgasm (<em>Do I look like that now?</em> Lucy wondered), saw her dead eyes as she floated. Tentacles tearing her open. Blood and gore. A gunshot.</p>
<p>When Rose vanished, a cold emptiness filled Lucy, leaving her alone with memories that didn’t feel like her own anymore. Hollow and violated, a stranger in her own skin.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>She opened her eyes and fell to the ground, gagging.</p>
<p>Ethel was shouting about abuse and the law. Lucy pulled one of Thomas’s talismans from around her neck.</p>
<p>“Sweet Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,” Rose told Ethel. “She saw it. She saw the thing.”</p>
<p>“What?” Ethel asked, rounding on her, just as Lucy slammed her fist through Rose’s incorporeal body.</p>
<p>Rose shrieked in pain, flickering in and out of existence. She spun out of control into the night sky.</p>
<p>“You bitch!” Lucy screamed. “You had no right! If you weren’t dead, I’d kill you myself!”</p>
<p>Ethel phased against Lucy, slammed her back onto the ground. “Where’d you get a grounder?”</p>
<p>“Ask your friend.” Lucy replied. “My husband was a spiritualist. He taught me a thing or two before that monster got him.”</p>
<p>Ethel’s eyes widened. “Your husband? But that’s – that’s impossible. All the victims have been women.”</p>
<p>“Don’t argue with her, Ethel,” Rose said. She still flickered, although it came more sporadically. She narrowed her eyes at Lucy. “Not now. We need to get up to the roof. That’s where it disappeared to. We’ll deal with her later. The constable will watch her.”</p>
<p>The golem stepped forward.</p>
<p>“I’m going with you,” Lucy said.</p>
<p>“No,” Ethel said. “You’ll only slow us down.”</p>
<p>And without another word, the two ghosts shot upward, disappearing into the wall.</p>
<p>Lucy sighed, stuffed her hands into her pockets, and watched the golem.</p>
<p>Something cried out above them. Lucy glanced up, saw a spirit twisting in the air, entrails spilling out of her.</p>
<p>The dead prostitute.</p>
<p>A window shattered behind the spirit, punctured by a tentacle. The appendage pierced the ghost, hooked her like a fish on a line, and then reeled the screaming, writing spirit back into the building.</p>
<p>“Do something!” Lucy shouted. The golem didn’t respond, just stared at her with a blank, flickering expression.</p>
<p>“Dammit!” Lucy shoved another round into the pistol’s chamber and fired point-black at the golem’s face. It stumbled backward, clay spraying the wall behind it. Without waiting to see if the fire went out of its mouth, Lucy turned and dashed into the building, reloading her pistol.</p>
<p>Halfway up the stairs, she found the creature in an empty, bedroom reeking of mildew and rotten meat, yellow paper peeling from the walls. It was a bloated, misshapen abomination sprouting claws and tentacles, covered by hundreds of cavernous mouths filled with teeth like straight razors.</p>
<p>Lucy staggered back, hiding behind the wall. <em>Hail Mary full of grace,</em> she thought. <em>What is it?</em></p>
<p>The chattering sound echoed in the room. The mouths, Lucy realized.</p>
<p>A tentacle burst through the wall, showering Lucy with cement shards and powdering her dress with pale dust. The tentacle coiled around Lucy’s waist, smashing her against the wall.</p>
<p>It dragged her into the room. Lucy gripped her pistol, dragging her heels against the floorboards.</p>
<p>“My name’s Lucy Stone. You’re acquainted with my husband,” she said, the practiced speech coming easy despite her terror.</p>
<p>The creature paused at her voice. Hissed.</p>
<p>“I will be your undoing.” Lucy pushed her pistol against the tentacle that held her and fired.</p>
<p>The creature roared, dropping her. Black phlegm spurted from the wounded tentacle. It whipped through the air, smashing her to the floor.</p>
<p>Other tentacles lashed out in a blur, knocking the pistol off the stairs, coiling around Lucy’s neck. Her skin burned where it touched her. In the distance, she heard a thumping sound. <em>Just my pulse,</em> she thought.</p>
<p>It slammed her back into the hallway, against the banister. Wood splintered and cut into her back. She kicked again, managed to look down. Saw the ground several stories below. The creature pulled her close to its thorax and its many mouths opened, flashing jagged white teeth. Thin, serpentine tongues flicked out of each mouth, like miniature tentacles. Foul breath filled the air, stinking of blood and decay. Lucy felt the tongues’ bristles touch her, stinging. It was smelling her through those bristles. Somehow, she knew that.</p>
<p>“Why did you take Thomas?” She couldn’t bring herself to ask if he was still alive. Rose’s invasion of her body and memories had brought everything back to the surface, swimming just before her eyes. “Goddamn you, why?”</p>
<p>The mouths grinned back at her, their teeth dripping with saliva and blood. Moans and growls bellowed from the monster. Voices echoed inside Lucy’s head, growing louder instead of fading. So loud she screamed. Some of the voices matched the mouths. They weren’t united; instead they drowned each other out, hollow whispers filling her thoughts. Then one of the voices surfaced above the others.</p>
<p>“Thomas?” it hissed, the voice wet and fleshy. For a moment, the mouths kept moving but went silent. The laughter spilled from several, until the rest joined in, mocking her in chorus.</p>
<p>Lucy gasped, pulling at the tentacle. The pounding rhythm in her ears grew.</p>
<p>“You are alone.” The tentacle tightened around Lucy’s neck. “Thomas was alone, too.”</p>
<p>It flung her against the wall. She fell, rolling down the wooden stairs. Cracked her forehead on a step, a trickle of warm blood blurring her vision. But she was alive. It hadn’t killed her.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em> She gritted her teeth. <em>Why hadn’t it killed her?</em></p>
<p>The thumping grew louder, closer. The whole staircase shuddered. Lucy wiped the blood from her eyes as the golem constable turned the corner, thudding up the steps, gaping holes in its chest and head. The monster lashed at the constable with its tentacles. The golem brushed them off with ease and leapt at the creature. Together, golem and monster fell into the stairwell’s void.</p>
<p>Lucy scrambled to her feet and looked over the ledge. She couldn’t see the creature but the golem had crashed onto the floor, its soft clay skin misshapen. It didn’t move, although its yellow eyes stared up at her with that dull gaze. Then they dimmed, flickering out, and Lucy huddled against the wall.</p>
<p>Alone, it had said. And it had been right. She was certainly alone.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>“Someone must’ve been watching out for you, Mrs. Stone,” Ethel said.</p>
<p>The two ghosts had flown over Whitechapel’s rooftops searching for the beast, they’d explained. Eventually, they found the trail of thick, dark blood leading back to the building and Lucy.</p>
<p>“Do you think so?” Lucy asked. She stood on the clay speckled tile floor. Goggled constables bustled in and out the door. The building residents stood on the stairwell, discussing what they’d seen. “I wonder why he wasn’t watching out for the other poor girls as well, then? Or your constable?”</p>
<p>“Christ,” muttered Rose. “Are you one of those fashionable Darwin-slandering cultists, trying to deny spirituality?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. I can’t deny it’s there,” she said and tapped her goggles. “But sometimes when I’m tired, I take off my goggles. And I can’t see. And that’s when I think I’m able to believe the most: when I’m almost able to deny it.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s rational,” Rose said, twisting her crooked neck. “That why you believe your husband’s dead? Because you never saw the body?”</p>
<p>“What?” Lucy asked. “You saw what happened. That thing killed my husband.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t see any such thing,” Rose said.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Stone,” Ethel said. “Have you considered that maybe your husband isn’t dead? He spent a significant amount of time in the company of prostitutes. It’s possible he’s still alive.”</p>
<p>“No, he wouldn’t do that,” Lucy said. “We argued a lot before he left, but he loved me. He wouldn’t just leave. He must be dead.”</p>
<p>“And that’s why you’ll help us?” Rose asked.</p>
<p>“What are you suggesting?” Ethel demanded. “That we endanger the life of an innocent, of a civilian?”</p>
<p>“We need a host to catch this thing,” Rose said. “You know that. There’s no other way. She wants to help. I say let her.”</p>
<p>“A host?” asked Lucy. “Why?”</p>
<p>“Lucy, we’ve been on the streets looking for this thing, or for a spirit it’s disembodied. We’ve never found one. In fact you’re the first thing, living or dead, that’s been able to tell us what it looks like.”</p>
<p>“But how can that be? I’ve studied Darwin,” Lucy said. “A person leaves some kind of imprint on this world when they die, even if they end up moving on to the next plane of existence.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Ethel said. “But what about ghosts? Do they leave anything behind?”</p>
<p>“Ghosts can’t die,” Lucy replied.</p>
<p>“We don’t linger forever, either,” said Ethel. “Some choose to pass onto whatever’s next as soon as they become disembodied. Others stay until everything we’ve known and loved fades away. But when we move on is a choice we make.”</p>
<p>“You saw what happened to that poor ghost,” said Rose. When the monster said you were alone, it was talking about spirits inside of you. You only had your own. Whatever this thing is, it’s only killing prostitutes having ghostgasms. It’s killing _ghosts_.”</p>
<p>“So you want to use me?” Lucy asked. “You want to come inside me and make me bait?”</p>
<p>“Out of the question,” Ethel said. “Absolutely not.”</p>
<p>“You were already trying to bait it earlier,” Rose said. “For God’s sake, you even shot it.”</p>
<p>“That’s why you tried to solicit me tonight, isn’t it?” Lucy asked. “You didn’t want sex, you were trying to catch that thing.”</p>
<p>“Not exactly. A little companionship is always welcome,” Rose said, pulling the slack out of the noose around her neck.</p>
<p>“That’s enough, Rose,” Ethel said. Lucy thought if Ethel had been flesh and blood, she would’ve blushed.</p>
<p>“So what do you say, Lucy?” Rose asked. “Can we have sex with you, for queen and country?”</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>“What will it feel like?” Lucy asked them the following night. She’d met Ethel and Rose only several blocks from where she’d found the dead prostitute.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, do I?” Rose said. “Never experienced it from your end.”</p>
<p>Ethel peeled a flap of her skin back and forth. “Aren’t you a spiritualist?”</p>
<p>Lucy didn’t reply. She’d been married to Thomas since she was seventeen and the idea of sharing that part of herself with someone else, physical or spiritual, made her feel unfaithful. She’d spent hours of the day researching what Darwin had written about the experience in preparation of the deed. An out-of-body experience was how the saint had described it. Looking at Ethel and Rose’s decrepit forms, the idea struck her as less than romantic.</p>
<p>“Lucy,” said Ethel, “You should know ghosts lose control when they’re inside a host. We’ll try and be mindful but we’ll need you to be on the lookout, too.”</p>
<p>Lucy thought of the ghostgasm she’d witnessed, how the host looked like she’d had less control of her body than the ghosts. “I understand.”</p>
<p>“Are you ready?” Ethel asked.</p>
<p>Lucy nodded.</p>
<p>“Enough wasting time, then,” said Rose. And with that,</p>
<p>The two ghosts flew into her body, exploding inside her.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>St. Darwin had been right: it _was_ like an out-of-body experience. She glided over her own body and saw Rose and Ethel moving inside her, against one another, clutching each other close. And yet she could feel every touch.</p>
<p>Wet kisses peppered her neck, sending a shock down her spine. A tongue filled her mouth and hands cupped her breasts while another pair traced her hips, pulling her tight. Fingers slid between her legs, tender, exploring inside her. Lucy’s breath quickened as she felt the growing warmth there. Whoever had told her this wasn’t messy hadn’t been completely honest.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes, tried to imagine Thomas. It worked for a little while. She felt it all happening to her, even though she was no longer inside her. Then she saw herself alone, twitching on the ground, her back arching.</p>
<p>She tried to swallow back tears, tasted their salty warmth as the joy spilled over her, rushing between her legs, throbbing. From her strange perspective, Lucy watched her own body glow as the ghosts moaned and cried out. She cried with them, saw the tears streaking her own face.</p>
<p>“Thomas,” she sobbed. “Thomas.”</p>
<p>In the distance, bells began to ring. Everything went cold. Lucy looked up and saw it slithering forward, toward them. Its mouths open and tentacles stretching out.</p>
<p>“It’s here!” cried Lucy. “Ethel! Rose!” She felt the ghosts disentangling themselves, trying to exit her body.</p>
<p>“Police! We’ve got golems surrounding you!” Ethel shouted. “Lucy? Lucy what are you doing!”</p>
<p>But Lucy ignored her and swooped toward the monster. She dodged the tentacles and spikes whipping about, and dove inside the beast.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>It was the opposite of having Ethel and Rose in her. All the bliss fled, replaced by a humid, sticky sensation. She wasn’t alone. Spirits surrounded her, their forms as destroyed as the physical victims. Lucy felt their hands grab at her dress, her hair, pulling her down further into darkness.</p>
<p>“Thomas!” she cried, trying to free herself. “Where are you?”</p>
<p>One of the spirits gripped Lucy. Her insides hung out, squishing against Lucy. The prostitute. “Help me!” she wailed.</p>
<p>Lucy yanked her arm away. “Thomas! Thomas, where are you?”</p>
<p>An arm wrapped around Lucy’s neck, pulled her up. “What the hell are you doing?” Rose shouted.</p>
<p>“I can’t find Thomas!”</p>
<p>“He’s not here. He was _never_ here!”</p>
<p>“He has to be!”</p>
<p>“Thomas?” The eviscerated spirit floated close to them but this time didn’t touch her. “Spiritualist? It – it didn’t kill him.”</p>
<p>A deeper sense of dread filled Lucy. “How do you know?”</p>
<p>Something cold and wet dripped on Lucy before the ghost could answer. She looked up and saw Rose’s spirit melting.</p>
<p>“Lucy!”</p>
<p>“Go,” the prostitute said. “Hurry!”</p>
<p>Around her, the faces and spirits closed in. The other spirits’ screams built in her mind the way the voices had on the stairwell.</p>
<p>Rose pulled once more. This time, Lucy let her.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>She sat up, gagging, the scent of stale sex clinging to her clothes.</p>
<p>The golem deputies had pinned the creature’s tentacles down, securing its body. One of the tentacles had impaled something shimmering. As the glow faded, Lucy realized what it was.</p>
<p>“Ethel?” she coughed.</p>
<p>The ghost twisted on the tentacle, chunks of her missing. The monster’s many mouths opened and closed.</p>
<p>Rose flashed beside the monster, prying at its thorax as the golems held it. It twitched and turned, going through its own ghostgasm. Then a howl broke out from all the mouths, and the creature split open. A blinding light washed out the dark street. The ghosts fluttered into the air, shimmering in all their dead glory.</p>
<p>She watched each of them fly out of the monster’s body, praying Thomas would appear, even though something inside her knew he would not.</p>
<p>Rose descended beside Ethel’s flickering, tried to cradle what was left of her lover in her arms, but instead slid right through her. She wailed.</p>
<p>Lucy stumbled toward them. “Rose?”</p>
<p>The ghost said nothing.</p>
<p>“What happened? How’d we get out when the others were trapped?”</p>
<p>“Maybe because it didn’t kill us, because we invaded it. I didn’t think much of it, I was following you.”</p>
<p>Ethel flickered one last time, and then disappeared. The monster’s tentacle stopped twitching.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand,” Lucy said. “You’re already dead.”</p>
<p>“You saw what almost happened when you used the grounder on me.”</p>
<p>“What did almost happen?”</p>
<p>Rose shook her head. “The beginning? The end? I don’t know. You’re the spiritualist.” Then Rose looked up, stared past her.</p>
<p>Lucy looked behind her, saw the spirit of the dead prostitute hovering there, trying to cover up the way her insides were spilling out. “I don’t have long,” she said. “Moving on, I guess. You freed us, so I thought you should know.” The prostitute shook her head. “My pimp reckoned the spiritualist should’ve paid for his research. Didn’t realize he was trying to help us girls.”</p>
<p>“Do you know where he is?” Lucy asked.</p>
<p>“He’s dead,” the spirit said. “Stabbed.”</p>
<p>“What?” Lucy said, blinking back tears. “Where is he? Where’s his spirit?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know that. Only his body. It’s in the cellar of a public house off Berners Street. I’m very sorry,” she said. Then the spirit faded until there was nothing left but wisps of steam.</p>
<p>Lucy staggered back, sobbing. Behind her, the golems pulled at the creature’s empty husk.</p>
<p>“I’ll send a patrol,” Rose said. “See what there is to see.”</p>
<p>Lucy nodded, trying to choke back the tears. Then she pulled off her goggles and shut her eyes. Rose vanished but suddenly, Lucy felt as though she could sense Thomas’s invisible spirit hovering just beyond her reach, lingering close beside her.</p>

Saint Darwinrsquo;s Spirituals
By D.K. Thompson

The ghosts wanted a threesome ndash; the two of them in Lucyrsquo;s body. It wasnrsquo;t an unheard of proposition, or so Lucy had been told. Prostitutes considered psychic whoring one of the safest tricks on the streets. All the pleasures of intimacy without the messy clean-up.

Ghosts had a nasty reputation for vanishing the moment after, though, no matter the talisman around your neck or the potion drunk before sunset, and so payments were usually collected up front. Not that Lucy was worried about the money. Her husband was the only thing that concerned her.

She adjusted her brass and leather goggles, peering through the ethereal tinted lenses to examine the ghosts.

They looked like the average apparitions. Both female. One spiraled around Lucy, long and curly hair obscuring her face. Large black blotches covered her body, causing her skin to peel off in patches. The other hovered several feet above the cobblestones in front of Lucy. She had a noose around her throat and her neck was bent so her head hung to the left side. She crossed her arms and took several breaths. Or whatever passed for breaths in the afterlife.

How long had it been since theyrsquo;d felt someonersquo;s touch? Lucy wondered. She remembered something her husband had told her long ago, before the murders, before hersquo;d disappeared. ldquo;Spirits linger in this world longing to be a part of it, to reconnect, to have some kind of physical, sensual experience,rdquo; Thomas had said. ldquo;Only a host can provide them that.rdquo;

Ghosts arenrsquo;t the only creatures haunted by the memory of a touch, my love, Lucy thought. And yet, despite being a devout spiritualist, she shuddered at the idea of the cadaverous spirits making love inside her. Shersquo;d never had a ghostgasm before, much less been paid for one. The ghosts looked sincere in their desire, not like dangerous murderers. Certainly not monsters. Still, lonely as she was, a ghostgasm wouldnrsquo;t help her find Thomas.

Read more....



ldquo;I donrsquo;t think itrsquo;s a good idea, Rose,rdquo; said the ghost spinning around Lucy. The air trailing behind her churned like water in a boatrsquo;s wake.

ldquo;Whatrsquo;s the matter, love?rdquo; Rose asked, winding the noosersquo;s end around her wrist. ldquo;She look a bit too practiced for your tastes, Ethel?rdquo;

Lucy felt her cheeks flush. She pulled her shawl over her shoulders and took several small breaths, all her tight corset allowed. ldquo;To be honest, I donrsquo;t service the dead.rdquo; It sounded so insulting, but she couldnrsquo;t tell them the truth.

Ethel came to a halt an armrsquo;s-length from Lucyrsquo;s face. ldquo;Irsquo;ve never heard of a whore who had much use for honesty.rdquo;

ldquo;A whorersquo;s a whore,rdquo; said Rose. ldquo;We need a rental and our moneyrsquo;s honest, if nothing else is.rdquo;

ldquo;Irsquo;m sorry,rdquo; Lucy said. ldquo;I meant no offense. But you should find someone else. Irsquo;m not quite ready for that kind ofhellip;spiritual
experience.rdquo;

ldquo;Well,rdquo; said Ethel. ldquo;Wersquo;ll just have to find a more e...</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://www.kyliechan.com/images/cover_thumbs/9780732282967.jpg" title="White Tiger" class="alignright" width="100" height="163" />Confession time: I don&#8217;t finish books I don&#8217;t like. I find it a waste of my time, and if I don&#8217;t care to finish the book, I don&#8217;t care to find out what happens at the end. *</p>
<p>The sad truth is, I didn&#8217;t finish <em>White Tiger</em>. </p>
<p>It hooked me, quite well in fact. I read 250 pages the first night. The pacing was good, the characters interesting. We have a headstrong English teacher, Emma, quitting her kindergarten teacher job in Hong Kong and immediately getting picked up as a live-in nanny for one of the girls she tutors. The single dad is smokin&#8217; hot, the girl is delightful, and the pay is amazing. The conflict comes when she realizes he&#8217;s a god and he can&#8217;t return to his palace because he has to protect his daughter from demons who would kidnap her to control him, but staying away from his source of power is making him weaker and weaker. (There&#8217;s a romance bit too, of course.)</p>
<p>Emma befriends the chauffeur/bodyguard, who is part information-dispenser and part tool to keep the character (and therefore the reader) in the dark. The character is a good one, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but he and Emma begin pulling practical jokes on each other that just seem to come out of nowhere. He doesn&#8217;t seem particularly playful, and every time they played a prank on each other, it pulled me out of the story because I started thinking, &#8220;Why did that happen?&#8221; </p>
<p>But the biggest flaw of this book was the lack of editing. It was far too long and needed tightening. Some dialogue was just unnecessary, some characters repeating <em>verbatim</em> sentences they&#8217;d said a paragraph earlier. </p>
<p>I can also see non-martial arts aficionados getting lost in the battle scenes, because Emma begins training with the god and Chan uses words that martial arts fans would know, but I&#8217;m afraid others would not. And even though she went into detail about the training, she kept using only the term &#8220;martial arts&#8221; and never saying what system they were studying. (The fact that this was a Chinese god teaching her &#8220;katas&#8221; which are Japanese forms bugged the crap out of me. At least she didn&#8217;t call him &#8220;sensei&#8221; which is also Japanese.)</p>
<p>In short, <em>White Tiger</em> had a good hook, a good premise, but suffered from bloat, and I just got bored with the repetition. If an editor had cut 100 pages, it probably would have held my interest.</p>
<p>* OK, there is one mystery I did wonder about. The name of the book is <em>White Tiger</em>, and we meet a god who is the white tiger, but as far as I read, his role was tiny. I wondered where Chan was going to put him that would justify naming the whole book after him&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="I Shall Wear Midnight" src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRzgkK4Dh5ww-Xgc_-wjXvSfujp9g9MWAGypjGEYYzJ2FOeAlQ&amp;t=1&amp;usg=__Vp0kwlwvuIML4JhfKhRhUJfYA7k=" alt="" width="182" height="276" />The world of genre fiction was dealt a serious blow when author Terry Pratchett announced that he suffered from early-onset Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. It didn&#8217;t stop him from writing, but it may have moved up the end of his writing career. His previous Discworld novel, &#8220;Unseen Academicals&#8221;, was – to my mind, anyway – full of plots and ideas that Pratchett may have wanted to cover in future novels but was afraid he wouldn&#8217;t be able to. I thought it made the book suffer.</p>
<p>Not so much with &#8220;I Shall Wear Midnight&#8221;, the latest – and possibly the last, depending upon the progress of Pratchett&#8217;s illness – Tiffany Aching novel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Midnight&#8221; begins when Tiffany is 16, and has taken on the mantle of the witch of the Chalk, a land in Discworld <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld_geography#Chalk">relatively close to Lancre</a>. She does all the mucky jobs witches do – birthing babies, seeing to the sick, laying out the dead, and generally living and working near the edge. Early on, we are shown just how well Tiffany has learned her craft from Granny Weatherwax, &#8220;the most highly regarded of the leaders [witches] didn&#8217;t have&#8221; (&#8220;Wyrd Sisters&#8221;) when she has to deal with Seth Petty, who has beaten his pregnant teenage daughter so severely that she lost the baby.</p>
<p>And there we have the first insight that &#8220;Midnight&#8221;, while being a YA novel and shelved as such in many bookstores, is not for the immature. The thing is, after having read the book, that sequence is the most graphic and adult in the novel. To me it served a similar purpose to Shepherd Book&#8217;s death in &#8220;Serenity&#8221; – a character will be killed off, to show how serious this is. There&#8217;s a scene or two later in the book that reminds us, but it doesn&#8217;t hold a candle to what Seth Petty did.</p>
<p>I think we needed it, too, because the novel&#8217;s main villain, the Cunning Man – the spirit of a long-dead priest of Omnianism, a religion established in &#8220;Small Gods&#8221; and referred to many times throughout the series – is somewhat hard to wrap one&#8217;s head around. We&#8217;re told he comes back every few hundred years, and he fights the witches, and the witches generally win. He came back this time because Tiffany kissed the Wintersmith (in the book of the same name) and drew enough attention to herself.</p>
<p>The Cunning Man is the kind of villain that works well for a YA audience because it makes people do things they normally wouldn&#8217;t, against their will – similar to the hiver in &#8220;A Hat Full of Sky&#8221; – but it makes the book a little difficult to follow when it comes to the main plot. It&#8217;s like &#8220;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&#8221;: Harry has the Dursleys, school, Quidditch, the Voldemort War, being in love with Ginny, <em>and</em> he has to deal with the whole Voldemort thing&#8230; but that last one gets lost in the shuffle amid all the other story arcs. The same with &#8220;Midnight&#8221; – Tiffany has to handle a lot of things in this book besides the Cunning Man, including caring for the people of the Chalk, the imminent marriage of her friend Roland (son of the Baron), the Duchess&#8217;s treatment of her people, and Amber Petty (Seth&#8217;s daughter), who seems to really like the Nac Mac Feegle.</p>
<p>Oh, yes. The Feegles are back – Rob Anybody, Jeannie the Kelda, and fan favorite, Daft Wullie. Rob even puts aside his Feegle nature for a moment when the Baron&#8217;s men threaten their mound. It&#8217;s quite a moment. And speaking of people who are back, one of the best parts of the book is when Tiffany meets Granny Weatherwax&#8217;s <em>other</em> successful apprentice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Midnight&#8221; brings us all our favorite witches – Granny, Nanny, and even Magrat, along with mentions of Tiffany&#8217;s friends Petulia and Anagramma, and her teacher Miss Tick – as well as introducing Mrs. Proust, who has a very surprising connection to Boffo (see &#8220;Wintersmith&#8221;). Tiffany also meets Captains Carrot and Angua (glad to see she&#8217;s finally gotten that promotion), Constable Haddock, and the inimitable Commander Vimes. But the book takes place on the Chalk, for the most part, and despite the attendance of the senior witches – one of whom (and you can easily guess which) has fought the Cunning Man before – it&#8217;s Tiffany who must save the day.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest: I really didn&#8217;t care for &#8220;The Wee Free Men&#8221;, but the rest of the Aching books have been good, solid stories, and if this one meandered a bit and did contain a tad too much additional plot (Miss Smith, the Duchess and Leticia, Tiffany Goes to Ankh-Morpork – which <em>really</em> felt shoehorned in there), Pratchett is still a good enough storyteller to tie it up neatly at the end. If &#8220;I Shall Wear Midnight&#8221; turns out to be the final Tiffany Aching novel, then I for one am satisfied with how her arc ends.</p>
<p>Besides, that means we can get back to the business of making Vimes the next Patrician*.</p>
<p><em>* Oh, come on, you </em>know<em> that&#8217;s how the Discworld series will end.</em></p>

<p><strong>FUEL</strong><br />
The third quarter report cards came out Thursday, and for Jamie, the timing couldn&#8217;t have been worse.  The Nike man was coming over that night to sell his brother some new blood.</p>
<p>He took his time walking home from Gilder Middle School, weaving past cracks in the sidewalk and mud puddles left behind by the spring thaw.  His pace slowed further as he turned onto Willow Avenue and saw his house, second on the left, a red brick ranch with spidery ivy growing up the east side.  Old leaves, fallen tree branches, and other detritus left over from the winter littered the front yard.  As he neared, he noted with dismay his father&#8217;s car already in the driveway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn.&#8221;  Jamie trudged across the yard and let himself in the front door with his keycard.</p>
<p>Dad was at the hall closet, hanging up his overcoat.  He stood just under two meters tall; a navy blue business suit wrapped his muscled frame.  He beamed when he saw Jamie.  &#8220;Hey there, kiddo.  How was school today?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re home early,&#8221; Jamie said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Need to get ready for the presentation tonight.  And I&#8217;d like you to clean up the front yard.  Make sure you use the dirt rake to get up that thatch.  Will you do that for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie opened his mouth to protest, but thought the better of it.  &#8220;Sure,&#8221; he said.  He unslung his backpack and headed for the stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh.  By the way.&#8221;  Dad fished in a suit pocket and produced a folded piece of paper.  &#8220;I got this in my email today.&#8221;  He opened the paper.</p>
<p>Jaime recognized the school&#8217;s letterhead on the printout.  He slumped, leaning against the wall.</p>
<p>Dad tapped the paper.  &#8220;What&#8217;s this C-plus in Basic Fitness about, kiddo?&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/2010/10/21/ep263-fuel/">Read more&#8230;</a><br />
<span id="more-1034"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I got A&#8217;s in my academic classes.  They&#8217;re all honors courses, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see that.  But we&#8217;ve talked about Fitness before, haven&#8217;t we?&#8221;  Dad looked down at him with a disapproving arch of an eyebrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So tell me.  What happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing.  I&#8217;ll do better next quarter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you fail the agility drills again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t do the pull-ups.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad pressed his lips together and took a breath.  &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure you&#8217;re giving it your best effort, Jamie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am.  I really am.  I&#8217;m just not very good at sports.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You get better with practice.  Like your brother Scott.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie nodded, keeping his gaze down, hoping Dad didn&#8217;t notice the way he gritted his teeth when he heard his older brother&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>Dad clapped him on the shoulder.  &#8220;Jamie, you&#8217;re twelve years old now.  It&#8217;s really important that you find your best sport.  College recruiters are already contacting boys your age.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie thought of his best friend Russell, who had just gotten his first recruiting letter the other day, from Penn State.  Jamie hung his head even lower.</p>
<p>&#8220;All I&#8217;m asking is that you try, son.  Will you do that for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie nodded again.</p>
<p>Dad folded up the grade printout and stuffed it into a pocket.  &#8220;Hey, I have an idea.  Why don&#8217;t you sit in on the presentation tonight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, man.&#8221;  Jamie looked up.  &#8220;Do I have to, Dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?  Maybe you&#8217;ll hear something you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>A groan escaped Jamie.  He had homework to do for Advanced Literature&#8211;the next two chapters of _Dracula_, which he&#8217;d loved so far.  But experience had taught him not to proffer academic work as an excuse.  &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you guys just order Scott&#8217;s blood online?  That&#8217;s what you usually do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Nike representative wants to show us some new and improved stuff.  The best yet.  Scott has regionals in two weeks, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So.  You&#8217;ll be there tonight, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, Dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad clapped him on the shoulder again.  &#8220;That&#8217;s the spirit.  Now let&#8217;s get that yard picked up, OK?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie went upstairs to change out of his school clothes before getting to work.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuel 6.1 is our latest release, and our best,&#8221; the Nike man said.  &#8220;You can see from the charts how our refined erythrocyte design maximizes oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange, nutrient absorption, and hormone capacity.  You folks have probably read about all that stuff already; it was part of the 6.0 rollout.  But 6.1 also features enhanced thrombocyte function that increases fibrinogen production by as much as fifty percent.  It lasts longer than 6.0, too.  You can go up to four weeks without a new transfusion.  And of course, Fuel still has the highest-quality, FDA-approved leukocytes and plasma substitutes available on the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Nike man topped two meters, taller than even Dad.  He had dark hair streaked blonde.  His skin was so deeply tanned that Jamie could swear it glowed.  The salesman&#8217;s hands seemed huge, each big enough on its own to comfortably grip a basketball.  He wore an immaculate black workout singlesuit that flowed with his movements.  And he had the shoes, of course.  Top of the line SuperJumps, solid black, like the suit.</p>
<p>He made his pitch in the living room, with the aid of handouts and multimedia charts from a display that stood on its own tripod.  Mom and Dad, seated on the couch, paid close attention, nodding at appropriate times, asking occasional questions, laughing at the salesman&#8217;s jokes.  Scott, just turned sixteen, long-legged and lanky, slumped between them with his arms crossed.  His gaze wandered as the Nike man talked.  Jamie sat in the rocking chair to one side, next to the bookcase filled with Scott&#8217;s track trophies and medals.</p>
<p>The Nike man continued:  &#8220;Athletes using Fuel 6.1 have shown documented increases in metabolism, endurance, and recovery from injury.  And if you purchase tonight, we&#8217;ll even throw in a free home transfusion kit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie shook his head.  Scott already had one of those.  Jamie had set it up for him many times, usually on nights before track meets.  Jamie had grown more proficient working the kit than his parents.</p>
<p>He glanced at the clock on the wall.  The time was just after seven o&#8217;clock.  If the Nike man finished his spiel in the next hour, Jamie would still be able to do some of his Advanced Lit homework.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow,&#8221; Dad said, smiling and nodding.  &#8220;That&#8217;s something, isn&#8217;t it, Scott?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess,&#8221; Scott said.</p>
<p>The Nike man gave an amused smile.  &#8220;You don&#8217;t sound convinced.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a sprinter.  I don&#8217;t care about all that endurance stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your forty time, Scott?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Four-one-five.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not bad.  But suppose I were to tell you that Fuel 6.1 can improve your personal best by as much as a full second?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, right,&#8221; Scott said.  &#8220;Whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Regionals are only two weeks away, honey,&#8221; Mom said.  She was small and wiry, with closely cropped hair and an angular face.  She still wore work clothes&#8211;white top, pinstriped jacket and skirt, heels.  &#8220;And didn&#8217;t your coach say you need to get under four seconds if you want to&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott cut her off with an exasperated sigh and a roll of his eyes.  An awkward silence fell.</p>
<p>The Nike man turned toward Jamie in the rocking chair.  &#8220;How about you, Jimmy?  This stuff is pretty cool, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh . . . it&#8217;s _Jamie_.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Nike man put on a let’s-be-friends smile.  &#8220;Do you think you would like to try Fuel?  I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;d like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The salesman&#8217;s radiant good health made Jamie uncomfortably conscious of the paunch around his middle.  &#8220;Um . . . no, thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?  This is quality stuff, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a sidelong glance toward his parents, Jamie said, &#8220;That&#8217;s OK.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Nike man’s smile became indulgent.  &#8220;I understand, Jamie.  You think that you could never be an athlete like your brother, or all the other kids.  But 6.1 could be the key for you.  Blood _is_ just like fuel, you know.  The better the fuel, the better your body will work.  In no time at all, you could be running track like your brother&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott laughed.  Mom shushed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8211;or, with your size, maybe playing football.  I could see you fitting in well at guard, or possibly even center.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, that&#8217;s what I keep telling him,&#8221; Dad said.</p>
<p>Jamie&#8217;s cheeks burned.  Why couldn&#8217;t the guy just leave him alone and get on with the presentation?</p>
<p>The Nike man said, &#8220;You really shouldn&#8217;t overlook the benefits of athletic competition.  Athletes are much less likely to get involved with drugs or alcohol, or drop out of school.  You might even get to attend college on an athletic scholarship, if you&#8217;re good enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will it make me smarter?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad cleared his throat.</p>
<p>The Nike man cast a puzzled glance toward the couch.  &#8220;Well . . . Fuel is designed to enhance _athletic_ performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s taking all _academic_ classes,&#8221; Scott said with a sneer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;  The Nike man&#8217;s smile thinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s still taking Basic Fitness.  And he hasn&#8217;t even started his Nutrition courses.  Hell, when I was Jamie&#8217;s age, I had already gone through Advanced Conditioning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re, ah, we&#8217;re very proud of him.&#8221;  Mom, glancing uneasily at Jamie, patted Scott&#8217;s knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie glowered at his smirking brother.  &#8220;I got A&#8217;s in all my honors courses this quarter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Nike man said, &#8220;Jamie, academic scholarships are mighty hard to come by these days.  Take it from me, most schools just don&#8217;t have the necessary funding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie looked at the floor.  In a mumble, he said, &#8220;I guess I don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Jamie; I missed that.  What did you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie&#8217;s mouth drew tight, like a drawstring bag.  The collective stare of his parents, his brother, and the Nike man weighed on him, suffusing him with a deep weariness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jamie?  What did you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>He raised his chin, scowling.  &#8220;I said, _I don&#8217;t care_.  All right?  You happy now?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Nike man took a step backward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like football.  Get it?  I don&#8217;t like track, either.  I don&#8217;t like sports.  I got A&#8217;s in all my honors courses.  Now will you just leave me alone?  Please?&#8221;</p>
<p>His heart raced.  He breathed heavily, as if he&#8217;d just run around the block.  He wondered at his own words.  Had he actually just spoken them in front of his parents?  He turned to the couch, suddenly terrified.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jee-_zus_.&#8221;  Scott stood suddenly.  &#8220;Do I have to stay down here and listen to this crap, Dad?  You&#8217;ve already ordered my blood.  This guy&#8217;s just here to talk to Jamie, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scott, you be _quiet_!&#8221;  Mom glared at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?  It&#8217;s true, isn&#8217;t it?  You&#8217;re just trying to get him with the program.  Waste of time, if you ask me.  His buddy&#8217;s already getting scholarship offers, and fat little Jamie just hides in his books.  He&#8217;s a friggin&#8217; loser.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad stood, too.  His face was stern.  &#8220;That&#8217;s enough out of you, young man.  You may go to your room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott set hands on hips.  &#8220;And what if I don&#8217;t?  You gonna ground me?  I have regionals in two weeks.  You wouldn&#8217;t want me to miss practice, would you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mom and Dad exchanged glances.  The Nike man looked at his perfect shoes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shit.  I&#8217;m going over to Kevin&#8217;s.&#8221;  Scott stormed out the front door, slamming it hard enough to rattle the windows.  One of Mom&#8217;s ceramic angel figurines fell from the knickknack shelf.  The carpet cushioned its fall.</p>
<p>Jamie gaped at his parents.  Neither one would meet his gaze.</p>
<p>And he understood why the Nike man was here.  Why his parents hadn&#8217;t just ordered the new blood online, as they usually did.  Why Dad had insisted on Jamie being present for the presentation.  Why the Nike man had focused so much attention on him.</p>
<p>Jamie looked around the room.  His gaze found the multimedia display on its tripod, charting the performance-enhancing benefits of Fuel.  He had never felt so alone in all his life.</p>
<p>Slowly, he got to his feet.  His throat double-clutched.  &#8220;I think . . . I&#8217;m gonna be sick.&#8221;  He headed for the bathroom on unsteady legs.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>The sun had long since set before a timid knock came at Jamie&#8217;s bedroom door.  It opened, and Mom entered.  In the darkness, she was only a silhouette.  &#8220;Jamie?  Are you awake?&#8221;</p>
<p>He lay supine on his bed.  &#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat on the edge of the bed.  &#8220;Honey, I&#8217;m so sorry about what happened tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay, Mom.  I&#8217;m sorry, too.  For what I said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father and I just don&#8217;t want you to miss out on any opportunities.  Your friend Russell&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking, Mom.  I&#8217;d like to try the new blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would?&#8221;  She put a hand on his arm.  &#8220;Oh, Jamie, are you sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure.  Can we still get the free transfusion kit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, actually . . . we hoped you would change your mind.  We ordered the blood for you.  The kit&#8217;s downstairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh.  Good.  Is it very much different from Scott&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks the same, I think.  You should be able to assemble it yourself.  You&#8217;ll probably be able to do your own transfusions, even.&#8221;  She leaned over and kissed his forehead.  &#8220;You&#8217;re growing up.  Your father and I are very proud of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie was grateful for the darkness, so that his mother could not see his face twist with pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;You get some sleep now,&#8221; Mom said.  She stood and looked down at him for a moment.  Jamie imagined that she was probably smiling.  Then she left, quietly shutting the door behind her.</p>
<p>Tears threatened, but Jamie fought them down.  He had much too much to think about.</p>
<p>After his first transfusion, he would have a whole body&#8217;s worth of blood left over.  _Normal_ blood.  Usually, it was sent to the Nike people for recycling.  But if Jamie could somehow hide it instead&#8211;store it in the basement freezer, maybe&#8211;then . . .</p>
<p>Regionals were only two weeks away.  Scott would do a fresh transfusion the night before; he always did.  Jamie would help him with it, as usual.  And he and Scott had the same blood type.</p>
<p>In the darkness, Jamie smiled.  The Nike man had called it Fuel.  Well, knowledge was a kind of fuel, too.  Mom and Dad and Scott didn&#8217;t understand that.  Not yet, anyway.</p>
<p>He would get in serious trouble, of course.  But it would be worth the punishment if, only for a moment, they would understand him at last.  It would ease the loneliness.</p>
<p>Still smiling, Jamie drifted off to sleep.</p>

FUEL
The third quarter report cards came out Thursday, and for Jamie, the timing couldn't have been worse.  The Nike man was coming over that night to sell his brother some new blood.

He took his time walking home from Gilder Middle School, weaving past cracks in the sidewalk and mud puddles left behind by the spring thaw.  His pace slowed further as he turned onto Willow Avenue and saw his house, second on the left, a red brick ranch with spidery ivy growing up the east side.  Old leaves, fallen tree branches, and other detritus left over from the winter littered the front yard.  As he neared, he noted with dismay his father's car already in the driveway.

"Damn."  Jamie trudged across the yard and let himself in the front door with his keycard.

Dad was at the hall closet, hanging up his overcoat.  He stood just under two meters tall; a navy blue business suit wrapped his muscled frame.  He beamed when he saw Jamie.  "Hey there, kiddo.  How was school today?"

"You're home early," Jamie said.

"Need to get ready for the presentation tonight.  And I'd like you to clean up the front yard.  Make sure you use the dirt rake to get up that thatch.  Will you do that for me?"

Jamie opened his mouth to protest, but thought the better of it.  "Sure," he said.  He unslung his backpack and headed for the stairs.

"Oh.  By the way."  Dad fished in a suit pocket and produced a folded piece of paper.  "I got this in my email today."  He opened the paper.

Jaime recognized the school's letterhead on the printout.  He slumped, leaning against the wall.

Dad tapped the paper.  "What's this C-plus in Basic Fitness about, kiddo?"

Read more...


"I got A's in my academic classes.  They're all honors courses, too."

"I can see that.  But we've talked about Fitness before, haven't we?"  Dad looked down at him with a disapproving arch of an eyebrow.

"Yes."

"So tell me.  What happened?"

"It's nothing.  I'll do better next quarter."

"Did you fail the agility drills again?"

"I couldn't do the pull-ups."

Dad pressed his lips together and took a breath.  "I'm not sure you're giving it your best effort, Jamie."

"I am.  I really am.  I'm just not very good at sports."

"You get better with practice.  Like your brother Scott."

Jamie nodded, keeping his gaze down, hoping Dad didn't notice the way he gritted his teeth when he heard his older brother's name.

Dad clapped him on the shoulder.  "Jamie, you're twelve years old now.  It's really important that you find your best sport.  College recruiters are already contacting boys your age."

Jamie thought of his best friend Russell, who had just gotten his first recruiting letter the other day, from Penn State.  Jamie hung his head even lower.

"All I'm asking is that you try, son.  Will you do that for me?"

Jamie nodded again.

Dad folded up the grade printout and stuffed it into a pocket.  "Hey, I have an idea.  Why don't you sit in on the presentation tonight?"

"Oh, man."  Jamie looked up.  "Do I have to, Dad?"

"Why not?  Maybe you'll hear something you like."

A groan escaped Jamie.  He had homework to do for Advanced Literature--the next two chapters of _Dracula_, which he'd loved so far.  But experience had taught him not to proffer academic work as an excuse.  "Why don't you guys just order Scott's blood online?  That's what you usually do."

Issue 1<br />
Written by Mark Millar<br />

Out now</p>
<p>Simon Pooni has multiple sclerosis, a body that’s rebelling against him and exactly one friend, Chris.  Every week they go and see a movie, every week they chat and every week Simon gets a little sicker, a little further away.  What matters though is that for two hours he’s somewhere else, transported away from his body and into the film.</p>
<p>Then he meets Ormon, a monkey wearing a spacesuit, who makes him an offer…</p>
<p>Superior is the latest title from Mark Millar, write of Kick-Ass, Nemesis and numerous other titles and, like every Millar comic, it’s surrounded by a corona of hype and bile that resembles nothing more than a circus tent being set alight by an angry crowd who are paying for the privilege of doing so.  Millar is a controversial writer, certainly, but this review isn’t about Millar, it’s about Superior and the more I think about it, the more I realize it’s about that moment of escape where pop culture grabs you and holds you and takes you away with it.  That’s the moment the circuit closes, the moment everything is a little brighter, the moment the guitars kick in.  Everyone has countless variations on that moment and for me, they’ve included President Bartlet’s first appearance in The West Wing, the final line in Daredevil and Liz Lemon rolling her eyes and yelling ‘Son of a MOTHER!;’  Everyone is different, everyone is right.</p>
<p>Simon’s moment comes when he looks at the movie version of Superior (Endearingly, they’re watching Superior 5) and doesn’t see the old fashioned heroics, hackneyed plots and CGI that Chris does.  Instead, Simon sees someone who is strong, upright, capable where he’s not, free where he’s restrained.  Superior is everything Simon isn’t and everything he desperately wants to be.  What happens when he’s given everything he wants and how it affects his world remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Millar’s script is expansive and decompressed but there’s a sense of weight here, as we deftly get Simon and Chris’ friendship, Simon’s past, his relationship with his mother and Superior’s place in the world neatly established.  It feels a little like a movie treatment but that’s more in the subject matter than the delivery and Millar takes to this sort of expansive, almost universal storytelling remarkably well.  The art team are on top form, Leinil Francis Yu’s sharp, beefy lines expressive, fast but always detailed and with real weight, all neatly grounded by Dave McCaig’s colours.</p>
<p>All in all, Superior looks beautiful, feels confident and assured and is about as good as first issues come.  It’s a good story, well told and that’s all that matters when it comes down to it.  Well, that and the spacesuited monkey, that’s the icing on the cake.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It doesn&#8217;t take much of an excuse for me to want to Talk About Doctor Who. Really, it doesn&#8217;t. But this is quite a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/11/the-doctor-is-in/8248">nice love letter to the series</a> from James Parker over at The Atlantic, and I&#8217;ll take the chance it presents —</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">This is all meat and drink to the 21st-century viewer, who has no idea who he is either. We are now entering the era of post-secular television—of Lost and Heroes, of time loops, unearthly powers, chaotic entrances into parallel dimensions—and the Doctor and his wheezing sci-fi are, finally, bang up-to-date.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>— to talk about the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/oct/12/doctor-who-immortal-reveals-bbc">latest kerfuffle in the Whoverse</a>.</p>
<p>On its face it&#8217;s not the worse thing to befall speculative fiction that the Doctor is immortal. On a purely production level, a show that&#8217;s been going off and on for about a half century doesn&#8217;t seem like it would be tripped up by a little thing like losing the main character (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_(Doctor_Who)">Ahem</a>), but reaction to the change in canon (oddly made in the CBBC&#8217;s Sarah Jane Adventures) has been <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/oct/12/doctor-who-immortal-reveals-bbc">mainly critical on story grounds</a>.</p>
<p>Which seems odd to me, after all it&#8217;s not like english literature doesn&#8217;t have its fair share of immortal characters dotted across the landscape. The show even has its own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Harkness#Face_of_Boe">character who is, for all intents and purposes, immortal</a>. Perhaps the Doctor will come upon the day where life really does begin to seem like butter over too much bread. In the last season he certainly made it clear that the TARDIS has let him skip the boring days, and that he would have a difficult time living a normal life, without the Daleks to defeat and silences to break. Maybe someday the <a href="http://io9.com/5665697/man-discovers-dalek-in-the-rings-of-a-tree-claims-its-jesus">Daleks&#8217; latest invasion</a> of the galaxy at l won&#8217;t be quite interesting enough to stop and he&#8217;ll go west, but having the character&#8217;s end be of his own choosing or the tragedy of a too-quick death won&#8217;t dispel the magic of the story.</p>
<p>That said, it does seem to run counter to the arc of the last few Doctors since the restart, who, despite being on the younger end of the Doctor-Actor range spectrum, have increasingly noted their age and general universe-weariness (though, really, given that Doctor #1 was 950ish, and Doctor #11 is still 950ish, I&#8217;m not sure how much he&#8217;s actually aged, except possibly emotionally). Perhaps the closest match to an immortal Doctor would be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_(comics)">Dream</a> of the Endless (though, let&#8217;s face it, in terms of cool-factor he&#8217;s probably a bit more of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_(DC_Comics)">Death</a>). Immortal characters still have arcs, and given the relatively short time frames of most works of literature it&#8217;s hardly like a character&#8217;s oncoming death is a critical motivator of plots. For the Doctor, life has always been about constant movement, especially since the loss of Gallifrey.</p>
<p>The focus on the character&#8217;s final death misses the fact, entrenched in series since the reboot, that each regeneration is really a death in and of itself. Look at the anguish of Ten&#8217;s last few episodes, or the quiet sadness that met the regeneration of Nine. To see the Doctor&#8217;s final death as the only real one for the purposes of the story is missing the trees for the forest.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I feel like my first post of the new Escape-Pod-has-a-real-blog era should be full of originality and in no way derivative of prior works, but we just don&#8217;t have that kind of time out on this arm of the spiraling blogosphere.</p>
<p>So this morning I read The Guardian&#8217;s quite interesting <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/oct/09/insane-clown-posse-christians-god">profile of Insane Clown Posse</a>, which I had honestly thought was actually in the vein of Weird Al Yankovic when I first saw the Miracles video (&#8220;<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/f-cking-magnets-how-do-they-work">F#cking Magnets, how do they work</a>?&#8221;) oh so many months ago without any of the needed context (actual <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGbdomlBnJM">Weird Al Yankovic-esque version here</a>). The reality is, as it is so often, much worse.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Violent J says, &#8220;science is… we don&#8217;t really… that&#8217;s like…&#8221; He pauses. Then he waves his hands as if to say, &#8220;OK, an analogy&#8221;: &#8220;If you&#8217;re trying to fuck a girl, but her mom&#8217;s home, fuck her mom! You understand? You want to fuck the girl, but her mom&#8217;s home? Fuck the mom. See?&#8221;</p>
<p>I look blankly at him. &#8220;You mean…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you don&#8217;t really feel that way,&#8221; Violent J says. &#8220;You don&#8217;t really hate her mom. But for this moment when you&#8217;re trying to fuck this girl, fuck her! And that&#8217;s what we mean when we say fuck scientists. Sometimes they kill all the cool mysteries away. When I was a kid, they couldn&#8217;t tell you how pyramids were made…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like Stonehenge and Easter Island,&#8221; says Shaggy. &#8220;Nobody knows how that shit got there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But since then, scientists go, &#8216;I&#8217;ve got an explanation for that.&#8217; It&#8217;s like, fuck you! I like to believe it was something out of this world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I&#8217;ll hazard a guess that if you&#8217;re taking the time out of your busy week to listen to a science fiction podcast that you&#8217;re probably a big believer in Science as a source of wonderment.  I mean, it&#8217;s given us things like <a href="http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/">CERN</a> and the <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2010/10/the_national_ignition_facility.html">National Ignition Facility</a>, both of which have to be some of the coolest science happening <a href="http://io9.com/5663237/">within a few dozen parsecs of Earth</a>. But really what the profile reminded me of was Jo Walton&#8217;s post over at Tor about the <a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2009/07/apollo-11-and-science-fiction-and-me">Moon landing and a backyard party</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was at an outdoor party once. There was a beautiful full moon sailing above the trees, above the whole planet.  And there was a guy at the party who proclaimed loudly that the boots of the Apollo astronauts had contaminated the magic of the moon and that it should have been left untouched.  I disagreed really strongly. I felt that the fact that people had visited the moon made it a real place, while not stopping it being beautiful. There it was, after all, shining silver, and the thought that people had been there, that I could potentially go there one day, made it better for me. That guy wanted it to be a fantasy moon, and I wanted it to be a science fiction moon. And that’s how the day of the moon landing affected me and my relationship with science fiction, twenty years after it happened. It gave me a science fiction moon, full of wonder and beauty and potentially within my grasp.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is is an observation that I&#8217;ve turned over in my head many times since I first read it so many months ago. Though I&#8217;m quite skeptical that the opposite of science fiction is actually fantasy and not a more modern mysticism¹, but the point is that the stars are no more tarnished by our ability to begin to <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/10/gliese581g-may-not-exist/">identify the planets</a> among them in than the myths of the great sea monsters of old are tarnished by our discoveries of the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/biub6/my_god_its_a_monster/">real monsters of the deep</a>. But for some the thought that all is not explicable is comforting, and I&#8217;ve always thought that part of science fiction&#8217;s job is to break down that belief that wonder is only found with a lack of understanding.</p>
<p>—————</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">¹Overseeing the slush pile here at Escape Pod I know we get a lot of stories that are edge cases between us and Podcastle, and I&#8217;d argue that fantasy as a genre doesn&#8217;t really tolerate stories where the explanation for events or occurrences is truly lacking, it&#8217;s just that fantasy&#8217;s toolkit is a spellbook, and ours is a physics text. The explanation still has to exist in fantasy, whereas with these more modern mystics they seem to prefer no explanation whatsoever, merely the end product at which to marvel.</p>

Captain Harash was its last occupant, the last living man from Earth, and both he and Duxa knew he was dying.

"It's time, Duxa," he told her.

She checked the output from his lifechair. While it was still replicating most of his bodily functions for him he did not seem appreciably worse than when she'd last monitored him, less than half a second before.

"We're not at our destination yet, Captain."

"You'll make it there without me, Duxa."

And the processors that she must have built but could never quite find -- she was enormously bulky, and by now some of her was a mystery even unto herself -- created an awkward sensation. Duxa told him: "I will be lonely without you."

"And that's good," Harash said.

"You wish me pain?" Duxa asked him.

"No. I wish for you to feel. I wish," and he paused here, his lips making the smacking noises she knew indicated a loss of reflexive controls as the plague made its way through his cranial nerves, "I wish that there were more things that you could feel, Duxa."

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I received a note from Helen Marshall who is working on a campaign to save the Sunburst Award, the Canadian juried speculative fiction award. Seeing as how Canada has brought us authors such as Minister Faust, Jo Walton, Spider Robinson, and Cory Doctorow (to name a few), I&#8217;m greatly inclined to help them out. Please check out her request and see if you can support their cause! (note the deadline is this friday, so you don&#8217;t have much time!)</p>
<blockquote><p>The Sunburst Award for Canadian Literature of the Fantastic is a juried award based on excellence of writing in two categories: adult and young adult. The awards are presented annually to Canadian writers with a speculative fiction novel or book-length collection of speculative fiction published any time during the previous calendar year.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Sunburst Awards have run into a hiccup.  They do not have enough operating capital to keep going as they currently stand. This sad news comes at a particularly critical juncture in the award&#8217;s life&#8211;the operating committee is in the process of getting the Sunburst organization registered as a non-profit, and getting it &#8220;national arts organization&#8221; status.</p>
<p>As part of a fundraising drive to shepherd the Sunburst through this change of status and structure, we’d like to ask fans, writers, editors, and publishers from the speculative fiction community to help raise awareness of this vital institution&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>How to Participate</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re looking for short (30 second to 2 minutes) videos that say what you think about Canadian speculative fiction. These should be interview-style videos in the vein of Speaker&#8217;s Corner and can be recorded as simply as with a web camera. Prior interviews or footage can be submitted provided that you have permission to do so.  We will host these individually on a YouTube channel (sunburstaward), but will also edit them in order to create a series of short videos to promote awareness of the fundraising campaign. A longer video will be shown at the opening remarks to the Toronto SpecFic Colloquium. Check out what we&#8217;ve got so far!</p>
<p>Not savvy with a camera? Send us a high res image of yourself and either a short paragraph in text or a recorded audio track.</p>
<p>Not Canadian? Never fear. If you have something you want to say about Canadian speculative fiction then we want to hear it.</p>
<p>To participate, send your name, contact information, submission and a short release statement giving us permission to use the video/image to sunburstvideo@gmail.com by October 15, 2010.</p>
<p>Possible Topics:<br />
-favourite Canadian authors and/or stories<br />
-the relationship between Canadian writing and the rest of the world<br />
-publishing speculative fiction in Canada<br />
-the state of Canadian fantasy, science fiction, horror, etc<br />
-how does Canada inspire your work?<br />
-favourite Canadian settings to use in your writing</p>
<p>Of course, these topics are intended to be a jumping off point. Feel free to think outside of the box. And, above all, show your<br />
enthusiasm!</p>

<p>Occasionally, the EP staff reads more than slush and short stories. I picked up <a href="http://www.kyliechan.com/books.cfm?series=1&amp;book=1" target="_blank">White Tiger by Kylie Chan</a> at the Voyager party at WorldCon last month and have been eager to check it out. I study Southern Shao Lin kung fu and love stories that incorporate martial arts. I&#8217;m starting it today and will report back. (Yeah, it&#8217;s fantasy, I can be well balanced. I read both kinds of fiction, science fiction AND fantasy.*)</p>
<p>Recently finished books include The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman, The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins, and The Alchemist and the Executioness, linked novellas by Paolo Bacigalupi and Tobias Buckell. And I do realize that blogging these books will indicate which books I&#8217;m sorely behind on reading, but hey, we can&#8217;t read everything the moment it comes out, right?</p>
<p>(*Paraphrase of this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSZfUnCK5qk">The Blues Brothers classic line</a>.)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey, you sass that hoopy Douglas Adams. He was a frood who really knew where his towel was. And what the answer to the ultimate question was. </p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s the end of the day, but I&#8217;m getting in on time! 10/10/10 (today&#8217;s date) is 42 in binary, and any good geek knows that 42 is the answer to the ultimate question, the question of life, the universe, and everything. </p>
<p>Douglas Adams died far too early in 2001, and ever since there have been days to commemorate him, including National Towel Day (May 25). If, by odd chance you don&#8217;t know Adams&#8217; work, starting with the classic Hitchiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy, or, if you&#8217;re a fan of Norse gods or time travel, the Dirk Gently series is bizarre and wonderful. </p>
<p>Douglas became the symbolic pillar of seizing the day to me and my husband. Around 1998, we were at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta, GA, and he was there promoting Starship Titanic. As shy geeks, we huddled together whispering, &#8220;oh look it&#8217;s Douglas Adams, oh man, let&#8217;s go talk to him, he&#8217;s tall! I don&#8217;t know what to say, I&#8217;m too shy!&#8221; We walked through the convention center until we decided no, we were wusses, we had to turn around and go back and say hi. Who knew when we&#8217;d get a chance to see him again? </p>
<p>By the time we got back to the booth, he was gone, headed to the airport to go back to England. We expressed dismay, and the woman at the booth was incredibly kind and actually gave us a copy of the game to make it up to us. Three short years later, he was dead of a sudden heart attack, and to this day we kick ourselves for being too shy to even say hi to the man whose writing touched so many geeks of our generation.  </p>
<p>We miss you, Douglas. </p>

"A takeover of your company with the state your market shares are in is not unreasonable." Although Soaces was right, there'd be precious little profit, even after he'd liquidated all of Renewal's assets and released the employees. But that wasn't why he wanted it.

"You're going to destroy us, aren't you? Tear us apart and sell us to the highest bidder."

"That's the plan."

"There's more to the company than the money. You'll eliminate so many people's livelihoods. Good people. Without Renewal, some of them won't have any other alternatives."

"Alternative to what? Luddite jobs? Machine labor?" He chose his next words, enunciating each syllable with relish. "It's all they're good for, isn't it? Can't have the un-teched getting above their station."

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi SF fans!</p>
<p>I wanted to talk about some changes that are happening here at Escape Pod.</p>
<p>First: DON&#8217;T PANIC. What you love about Escape Pod &#8211; free stories every Thursday &#8211; is not changing. At all. We&#8217;re not removing things as a change, we&#8217;re adding things.</p>
<p>Second: For a while, this site has been little more than a delivery device for the podcast. But now we&#8217;re going to add commentary, reviews, and news. We need help, though. If you&#8217;re interested in volunteering material for the blog, simply <a href="mailto:editor@escapepod.org" target="_blank">email me</a> and let me know what you&#8217;d like to contribute.</p>
<p>Third: <strong>Escape Pod is raising its rates. </strong> That&#8217;s right folks, we&#8217;re shooting for the stars and going for an SFWA pro rate format. We&#8217;ll be paying $.05 a word for new stories (maximum $300), $.03 a word for reprints (minimum $100). We&#8217;re doing this for a couple of reasons- authors deserve to be paid, of course. We&#8217;re hoping we can attract a greater caliber of authors, which will therefore grow our audience. Along with the rate increase, we&#8217;ll be asking for ebook rights to the stories so we can print them on our site, which will bring in a bigger audience. <strong>The rate increase will start with stories I accept after October 1, 2010. </strong><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>A side note- <strong>we&#8217;ll only be able to pay pro rates if the donations help us do so.</strong> we&#8217;re doing a six month trial; if our donations stay strong, it&#8217;ll be a permanent change for 2011, if they don&#8217;t, then in April we will drop back down to $100 a story. <strong>This depends on your support of the site.</strong></p>
<p>Alternately, if you&#8217;re a media publisher of any kind &#8212; television, movies, video games, a book seller, or just an indie author who wants to sponsor Escape Pod, that will help us out while also promoting you to tens of thousands of listeners.  You can email amanda at escapeartists.net for current rates and details.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some free fiction coming down from Escape Pod favorites:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><a href="http://craphound.com/?p=3082"><em>Jury Service</em>: By Cory Doctorow and Charlie Stross (audio only)</a></strong> &#8211; (from Cory&#8217;s blog)<em> Jury Service </em>is the first of two novellas Charlie Stross and I wrote about Huw, a technophobe stuck on Earth after the Singularity (the other one being <em>Appeals Court</em>). They are both being published, along with a third, yet-to-be-written novella <em>Parole Board </em>by Tor Books as R<em>apture of the Nerds</em>. We&#8217;re starting work on<em> Parole Board</em> in January, and to refamiliarize myself with the earlier novellas, I&#8217;m going to podcast both now (with the gracious permission of Charlie and our editor, Patrick Nielsen Hayden). Hope you enjoy &#8216;em &#8211; they&#8217;re as gonzo as I&#8217;ve ever gotten, I think! </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.timpratt.org/nex/?p=16" target="_blank"><strong><em>The Nex</em>: by Tim Pratt (text and ebook)</strong></a> &#8211; (from Tim&#8217;s blog) Unlike my other serials, this one isn’t an urban fantasy, and doesn’t take place in an existing series (though it does share a setting with a story, as I mentioned). It’s a novel narrated by a precocious 13-year-old who finds herself a long way from home with some disreputable people in a dangerous world. The book has shapeshifters, giant robots, aliens, kleptomaniacal monsters, heroism, shoplifting, terror, lecherous cyborgs, personable tyrants, steampunk submarines, subterranean tunnels, rustic French cuisine, a cult of teenage girls in fairy wings and leotards, teleportation, and people who get punched so hard they <em>disappear</em>. I hope you all like it. <em>[Ed- this is a free online book, so please support the author with a <a href="http://www.timpratt.org/nex/?page_id=2" target="_blank">donation</a> or a purchase of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0045JL56K" target="_blank">Kindle ebook</a>]</em></p>
<p>[<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>UPDATE</strong></span>- apologies, WordPress put the Doctorow file into our feed without me realizing, sorry for those of you who downloaded unwanted content. I've removed it, now you must right-click to download or go directly to Doctorow's page.]</p>

#

Introduction

It happens all the time: you're sitting in class, listening the best you can while Mister Waters goes on and on about atoms or sound waves or whatever, when suddenly you fall asleep. Your head lolls against your shoulder and some drool oozes from the side of your mouth. Luckily, Missy Woo kicks you in the knee to wake you up before someone notices, like Mister Waters or--worse--Austin. 

What's weird is that in those few minutes of sleeping, you dream like hours of stuff. You're all hanging out or playing basketball or walking the mall while everybody else is slowly raising their hands and taking notes. They all get twenty four hours that day, but you get a little extra.

But how much extra? 

Rated PG: For mild drug use.

"I know I can't do anything about this--" she gestured toward the tangled blankets, the hospital bed, the pale walls. "But I've asked the doctors to take some cells--I still have a few healthy ones left, you know, and they'll keep for some time--"

I could guess the rest. But Susan, ever the biologist, had her lecture after all. "It doesn't work like that." Her voice was gentle, as if she were speaking to one of her two sons, not to Mom. "A clone isn't the same as the original. Your clone would be no more like you than--than one identical twin is like another. It wouldn't be--" Susan's voice caught. "It wouldn't be you."

"You don't _know,_" Mom said. "None of the clones are old enough to ask yet. They're just babies." 

Rated G: Not for kids, but nothing to worry about if you listen around the kids.

"You've got a Net connection," I said. "Search around on "gender neutral" and "biomod operation."

They took Johnny Green from class 3a at ten orsquo; clock on Tuesday morning.  He was the last to go. They thought I didnrsquo;t notice, but Irsquo;ve been onto them for a while now.

<p><em>As he puts the cruiser in gear and takes off, I calm down a little bit, and smell something that worries me. I smell Apurna on him, like always, but she doesn’t smell right. She smells of nervousness bordering on fear, and come to think of it, he does, too. It’s an old smell&#8211;I’d say from late yesterday evening, just after work&#8211;but it’s unmistakable.

But the plane just stopped, and hung there, nose tipped at a slight angle, mere feet from the building.

And that's when the figure -- the one people call the Ambassador, or the Doctor, or the Outsider, or the Professor, or a hundred other names -- appeared. Just a middle-aged man in a white lab coat, with steel-rimmed glasses and graying hair. His image filled the air above the jetliner, like the dome of the sky had been transformed into an IMAX movie screen.

He said, "People of Earth, I have a message for you."

Rated PG  for ennui and futility of life.

Show Notes:

	Tim Pratt is serializing a Marla Mason novel, Broken Mirrors at his website. His first anthology is out this summer from Night Shade Books, Sympathy for the Devil.
Tom Rockwell's work can be found at his personal music website, Devo Spice, The Funny Music Project, and his comedy troupe, Cirque du So What?

It wasn't that Em disapproved of drug use, you just had to be savvy about which drugs you took. Back before she had to get a day job, she was a M@tch girl, much to the delight of the guys on the club scene. M@tch wasn't a wimpy drug, but it didn't turn you into a murderous street zombie either. It was also expensive -- a designer "where it's @!" drug -- that the Tweakers couldn't afford anyway.

Rated R for one sexual scene and drug use.

One of the first generation of Krenn had lived long enough to reach the site, though none had expected to. The very first Krenn had conceived of this journey in the distant past, dedicating his life and his posterity to the pilgrimage with an ever recycling population of clones. Like their clone-father, each was an optimized collection of smart matter no bigger than a speck. Hundreds of generations of Krenn had lived and died during the voyage, their remains enshrined into niches in the very walls of the vessel that now lay shattered at its destination.

The survivors flooded out upon the steppes of the heel, rejoicing despite the crushing weight that gravity forced upon them. They settled in, constructing mansions of haze and shadow, and waited for enlightenment to come. The mission and purpose of the first Krenn remained with each of them. This place had been the site of the greatest triumph of the greatest archaeocaster in all of history. Before the beginning of the quest, Krennmdash;the original Krennmdash;had felt drawn to it. He had cultivated the tales, sifted myth from coincidence, mastered the lost language of the interview-eschewing, spatial curmudgeons of the ancient dark times, and recreated the route through dimensional puzzles to this theoretical location. The odds of success had been so absurd not a single entelechy of Krenn's cregrave;che dared invest time or expense in the project. And yet, here they were, nearly three hundred unique individuals sharing the template of Krenn.

Rated PG: for Space Exploration and Looking into the Abyss

Her neighbor mdash; the other one, across the hall mdash; helped her figure it out, long before the math geeks finished crunching their numbers.

"Watch," he'd said, and laid a deck of cards facedown on her coffee table. (There was coffee in the cups, with a generous dollop of Bailey's. He was a nice-enough guy that Adele felt comfortable offering this.) He shuffled it with the blurring speed of an expert, cut the deck, shuffled again, then picked up the whole deck and spread it, still facedown. "Pick a card."

Adele picked. The Joker.

"Only two of those in the deck," he said, then shuffled and spread again. "Pick another."

She did, and got the other Joker.

"Coincidence," she said. (This had been months ago, when she was still skeptical.)

Rated R: for Lucky Streaks and Getting Lucky.
