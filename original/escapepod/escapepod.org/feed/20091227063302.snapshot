<p><i>&#8220;Took you long enough,&#8221; the voice said. The door clicked as Scrooge unlocked several locks, and finally it slid open a couple of centimeters. Scrooge peered out, the heavy chain still on the door. Jenny flipped the night vision off her camera to get a clear view of him in the foyer&#8217;s dim light.

<p>First appeared in <a href="http://www.asimovs.com">Asimov&#8217;s</a>, December 2002.</p>

<p><i>“They’re uploads, Jennifer.”  When I first met Mel, I thought the sleepy voice was sexy.  “How can they move in with us when they’re not anywhere?”</i></p>

<p><i>“They bought a puppet to live in,” I say.  “Life-sized, nuskin, real speak – top of the line.  It’s supposed to be my Christmas present.  Bring the family back together for the holidays and live unhappily ever after.”</i></p>

<p><i>“He’s giving her the difference so he can take extra time off for his bass tournament in June.”</i></p>

<p><b>Rated PG.</b> Contains family drama and way too much sugar.</p>

<p>Narrated by Sarah Tolbert, Kate Baker, Nate Periat, and Steve Eley</p>

<p>The story first appeared in <em>Fast Ships, Black Sails</em> edited by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer.</p>

<p><em>You could feel their heat. Not a metaphor, I don&#8217;t mean that, I mean literally the room grew warmer when they were in it. They were both so powerful. Whenever Anne and Jack (they weren&#8217;t named that then, but that&#8217;s who they were) strolled into the room you got contact highs from their lust. People who would never make out would find excuses to go to the bathroom together and come back with monster hickies. Everyone always wanted to sit near them because of their heat, and because they always said the thing you wish you&#8217;d said but only thought to say a billion blinks later.</em></p>

<p><em>When I first joined the Freebooter tech collective Anne and Jack were happy to have another girl in the group, but otherwise they ignored me. I could stare and stare at them all day long, hiding behind my black-rimmed glasses. But then one day Anne looked at me, and then Jack looked too, and we all just sort of fell toward each other. Like gravity. Like magic. Like there was a God. </em></p>

<p><strong>Rated ARRRRR.</strong></p>

Whenever Anne and Jack (they weren't named that then, but that's who they were) strolled into the room you got contact highs from their lust. People who would never make out would find excuses to go to the bathroom together and come back with monster hickies. Everyone always wanted to sit near them because of their heat, and because they always said the thing you wish you'd said but only thought to say a billion blinks later.

When I first joined the Freebooter tech collective Anne and Jack were happy to have another girl in the group, but otherwise they ignored me. I could stare and stare at them all day long, hiding behind my black-rimmed glasses. But then one day Anne looked at me, and then Jack looked too, and we all just sort of fell toward each other. Like gravity. Like magic. Like there was a God. 

Rated ARRRRR.

This story originally appeared in Aeon #14.

The diner stood off the highway outside a small town optimistically called Hope. Hope was being stuck in the middle of the Northwest and wishing you were someplace, anyplace else. And Hope was also the name on the tag pinned to the dead woman in waitress uniforms that was currently lying against the wall inside the Barbie-Q Roadhouse. I had to stop myself from worrying at the connection: looking for patterns when sometimes there are none at all.

I wasn't worried about Hope (the waitress, not the town). I didn't get called down here for a murder: shit, murder is an honest-to-God American pastime. Just look at the statistics. No, I got called in because of the Marilyn.

The Marilyn was also dead. All in all, there were five dead people in the Barbie-Q: two waitresses; a balding man who ndash; from his bag full of cheaply-printed catalogues ndash; was some sort of a general salesman; the diner's manageress; and Marilyn. They had been shot by a machine gun, probably an Uzi. Marilyn's head left a red smear against the glass of the booth she sat in. She was there alone.

What the hell was a Marilyn doing out here?

Rated R for violence and language.

Editor's note:nbsp; this is a sequel to EP007.nbsp; Listen to it here.

Flies buzzed around the edges of the huge stone block, gathering at the rivulets of blood that ran down to the floor. A bit of what looked like it might be intestine hung off one corner, drawing special attention. It was a testament to the force of the collision that fragments of bone and tissue were scattered all the way down the passage, some even wedged in the carvings in the stone walls. Two men surveyed the scene with dismay.

"See? And this just keeps happening. It's getting so we can't get anything done around here," said the taller of the two, a grey-haired man with red eyes and a patchy beard.

The other man, younger but not precisely young, hauled himself up on top of the block and examined the mechanism. "This bar's been sliced right through." He looked back down at his client. "You say this was a poltergeist?"

Practically the first thing she did when she took in the alien was to give him a new name. He looked at her outstretched hand long enough to annoy her, and then grasped it with his four opposable fingers and hung on limply until she wrenched her hand out of his moist and over-jointed grip.

She said, "I'm Sarah," and he said his name, or what she assumed was his name, in return, rolling the syllables around in his mouth like so many rough pebbles. His name was too long, something like Shperidth with extra grunting noises in the middle, like a car backfiring very far away.

The plan must have come to Rog fully formed that first morning, as he stepped off the elevator into the lobby of  Szilliken Sharpenwright and saw the old soldier newly stationed there in his omnichair between the potted  silk ferns and the coffee tables.

"Oh.  My.  God.  I am in love."

Megan, her arms loaded with Rog-House props and paraphernalia she hadnrsquo;t had time to ditch yet, said,  "You say that an awful lot for someone who styles himself completely asexual.  Not to mention atheistic."

Rated R for adult situations, a smattering of violence, and overly friendly chairs.

Certainly the tall buildings are gone, Xerox Square and Lincoln Tower and the few others that just last night poked above the horizon, touched by the red fire of the setting September sun.

Violet snapped three photos of herself from various angles, sent them, and waited for her boyfriend's response. He rang her upmdash;a slow vibrating purr, unlike the staccato door-knocking of her mother's ringvibemdash;and said: "Me likey. Now take it off."

Violet frowned. "You were supposed to dig up the backstory on the dress."

"Well, you can't blame me for getting a little distracted. Besides, isn't it bad luck for me to see?"

"That's only for weddings, not prom."

Rated R for language, teen-adult situations, and virtual steadies. Also, Norm's sexy talk.

When I met Skinhorse, my first thought was old.  Which was weird.  Nobody gets old these days.  We all die young, some of us after living a long time, if we're lucky.

He was in Piet's Number Seven, a bar-cum-caravanserai in an illegal orbit trailing far enough behind Vesta to be ignorable.  Piet's had been instantiated in an old volatiles bladder that had done the Jovian run a few too many times before falling into the surplus circuit.  You could store entire cities in Piet's cubage, which made for a somewhat attenuated bar experience.  Plus the place had one of those gravity cans -- yes, those gravity cans -- which meant your drink stayed stuck down long as you were near a Higgs carpet.

So there I was annoying myself with three perfectly disrespectable rock jocks, each of us out to fleece the others, when this cadaver starts to stand over me.  We're all forever young or forever dead, but this armstrong looked like he'd shaved about half a cent too deep across his whole body, then restored his dermis with spray-on thermal insulation.

Rated R for strong language, strong violence, and world-spanning tumors.

<p><em>I picked up a spade from the pile, and demonstrated by digging up a bluebell growing by the hedge.

You can tell the British bluebell because the flowers are smaller, deeper blue, and they&#8217;re usually
on one side of the stem, so the plant droops under their weight as if bowing down before its foreign conqueror.  There&#8217;s hardly a wood left in England where you&#8217;ll see only native bluebells.</em></p>

<p><em>&#8220;Or you can use your heel on the spade.&#8221;  I heaved the invader out of the earth and tossed it aside, knowing it would safely rot.  &#8220;But you should never press down with the middle of your foot.

There are safety signs around the factory. "Scrub Up." "Know Thyself." "Don't Blink." That last is the best piece of advice, here on the eyeball floor.

Wersquo;re swapping off some boy in a backwater push the locals cleared out for us. Wersquo;re sitting around a low table. I pass off another card to Kep. Luce swaps out a suit. She has to sit on one leg to lean over the table. Itrsquo;s hot in the low room, so humid that moths clutter aroundour feet, too heavy to fly.

The boyrsquo;s making little mewling sounds again. Somebody should shut him up, but not me. This is my hand. Irsquo;m ahead.

Rated R for violence and sexual situations.

"Buggerit, I don't have time for this," Joe muttered. The stable waiting for the small herd of cloned spidercows cluttering up the north paddock was still knee-deep in manure, and the tractor seat wasn't getting any warmer while he shivered out here waiting for Maddie to come and sort this thing out. It wasn't a big herd, but it was as big as his land and his labour could manage ndash; the big biofabricator in the shed could assemble mammalian livestock faster than he could feed them up and sell them with an honest HAND-RAISED NOT VAT-GROWN label.

"What do you want with us?" he yelled up at the gently buzzing farm.

"Brains, fresh brains for baby Jesus," crooned the farm in a warm contralto, startling Joe half out of his skin. "Buy my brains!" Half a dozen disturbing cauliflower shapes poked suggestively out of the farms' back then retracted again, coyly.

"Don't want no brains around here," Joe said stubbornly, his fingers whitening on the stock of the shotgun. "Don't want your kind round here, neither. Go away."

Rated PG for strong language, chemical violence, and drug-abusing dogs.

From acknowledged classics to forgotten gems we’ll be covering them all. Some of them you’ll have seen, some you won’t, some you’ll agree with me on and some you’ll wonder what I was drinking when I watched them but that’s half the fun. Spoilers abound so if you haven’t seen the movie and want to be surprised, go rent it now, we’ll be here when you get back.

A roan steer staggered around a concreted yard, its mute distress accompanied by clattering hooves and the fleshy slap of its thigh striking the ground when it fell. A new sound was introduced - incongruous, but familiar to Kevin's audience.

Whale song.

Gradually, the cow's shaking stilled, until it could stand securely. Its muscles continued to tremble, but not enough to upset its equilibrium while it listened.

First appeared in Interzone

Zhi 4's scream pierces the Siberian night. 



My spiked metal boots crunch through the snow as I race towards him, with Zhi 6 running at my side. The nanochip in my brainstem clicks on, and I reach out with my mind, but I can't sense even a trace of Zhi 4. A few seconds earlier his form had been outlined by the dark turquoise glow of the force field.



We stop twenty feet short of the field's perimeter. Beyond it, the hazy silhouette of the colossal Stalk looms, its millions of cilia undulating.


My bodysuit hums as it transmits data back to Xiang Xu Base, situated behind the Rusanov ice cap half a mile away.



My pulse flutters in anticipation and I take a deep breath to try to rein in my excitement. I -- like all Zhis -- have been designed with an insatiable curiosity about the Stalk's origins and vulnerabilities. Knowing I've been bred to feel this way doesn't make me feel it any less. Where did the Stalk come from? Why is it here? How can it thrive in these temperatures? I see the same questions reflected in Zhi 6's expression.

Rated PG-13 for cloning and some adult themes.

Rated PG for a worryingly low miles per gallon

 "You're a disgrace to your calling and your species." The Cardinal's words were at odds with the verging-on-seductive voice of the translator embedded in the Anturean's Chlor-tank. From beneath lowered lashes Ignatz O'Reilly, D.D. Inter-Species, watched his superior's mouth-tendrils vibrate, a gesture he knew denoted extreme lust or mounting rage.

 Lust was out of the question, he supposed.

 "Falling-down drunk at Mass. Passing out in Confession. And don't think your little black-market dealings go unnoticed." The Cardinal's posterior spines flushed blue. Ignatz averted his eyes even further, studying the faint brown lines crisscrossing each other on a slate floor the color of dried blood. The mutant squid bastard really was mad this time. 

 "If I might be permitted to explain, Your Eminence..." Ignatz's tongue tasted like last night's liquor. "I indulge for purely medicinal reasons...a slight asthmatic condition...any allegations that I would engage in illegal..."

Rated R for religious themes, carousing, and transubstantiaton of a different sort.

<p>There are a number of good writers now breaking into the big leagues through podcasting.  My friend <a href="http://jchutchins.net">J.C. Hutchins</a> is one of them.  I loved his <a href="http://www.7thsonnovel.com">7th Son</a> trilogy, and I jumped at the chance when he asked me to read an advance copy of his horror novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312383827?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=escapepod-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0312383827">Personal Effects: Dark Art</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=escapepod-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=0312383827" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> and record a reaction for him.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my initial reaction (Hutch liked it enough that he added the background music and bumper titling and such):</p>

<p><object width="360" height="207"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4947110&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00adef&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4947110&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00adef&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="360" height="207"></embed></object></p>

<p>And here&#8217;s the big group &#8220;vlurb&#8221; project that my piece was a part of:</p>

<p><object width="360" height="207"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5070261&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00adef&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5070261&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00adef&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="360" height="207"></embed></object></p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/5070261">J.C. Hutchins&#8217;s &#8220;Personal Effects: Dark Art&#8221; - SuperVlurb</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/sfeley">Stephen Eley</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>(The folks in that vlurb are all awesome and you should check out their sites: <a href="http://PJBallantine.com">Philippa Ballantine</a>, <a href="http://scottsigler.com">Scott Sigler</a>, <a href="http://sethharwood.com">Seth Harwood</a>, <a href="http://wordsushi.com">Mark Yoshimoto Nemcoff</a>, <a href="http://christianaellis.com">Christiana Ellis</a>, <a href="http://Matt-Wallace.com">Matt Wallace</a>, <a href="http://jamesmelzer.net">James Melzer</a>, <a href="http://maxquickseries.com">Mark Jeffrey</a>, <a href="http://murverse.com">Mur Lafferty</a>, <a href="http://crescentstation.net">Phil Rossi</a> and <a href="http://mattselznick.com">Matt Selznick</a>.)</p>

<p>I read the book in PDF form.  And then I pre-ordered it on Amazon, because it&#8217;s just that good.  (Also because the little goodies that come with the physical copy sound like fun.)  This is an unusual horror novel: it brings in a lot of conventional settings and tropes, but the characters break from formula in some surprising ways.  And it&#8217;s a <i>smart</i> horror novel.  Silliness in hats aside, I highly recommend it.</p>

<p><em>Mr. Wayne was taking his daily exercise, walking Arthur around the lake in Nevley Park, when the sky darkened and a light snow began to fall. A few flakes fluttered against his cheeks. He could feel the cold through his heavy topcoat. He enjoyed the park when it was deserted, but at his age he couldn&#8217;t afford a chill. He thumbed the control in his pocket.

Ulbarton’s Flu, as the public knows all too well, now afflicts upwards of thirty million Americans, with the number growing daily as the highly contagious flu spreads.  Halitex “flu-proofs” the body by inserting genes tailored to confer immunity to this persistent and debilitating scourge, whose symptoms include coughing, muscle aches, and fatigue.  Because the virus remains in the body even after symptoms disappear, Ulbarton’s Flu can recur in a given patient at any time.  Halitex renders each recurrence ineffectual.</em></p>

		<itunes:summary>Editors Note: As you may have noticed, episode 201 is appearing before Episode 200.nbsp; We're still working out the kinks of an agreement with the mysterious agent forces mentioned in an earlier update, but we should have that episode for you soon, and we think it'll be worth the wait.nbsp; Rather than keep you waiting any longer, we're bringing you 201 out of sequence.

First appeared in Aeon Speculative Fiction.

ldquo;A construct is no Crow!rdquo; Tommy shouted, the ridiculous war bonnet hersquo;d worn to my fatherrsquo;s funeral slipping off his head. He pushed it back with an angry swipe of his hand, glaring at the gathered members of the tribe, daring them to laugh.

ldquo;Harry can do everything a man can do,rdquo; I said. There were many people in the lodge that I recognized, but there were many more, ghosts of my past, who should have been there and were not. ldquo;He can hunt, write poetry, sing a song. He can think and he can feel. I taught him how to shoot and how to track, how to read and how to write. No matter that he sprang from my brain instead of my manhood. He is my son, the only one this old man will ever have. He is a Crow.rdquo;

ldquo;What can a machine know of tradition and honor?rdquo; Tommy asked, his lined face veiled in the shadows cast by the fire. He drew a pipe from his pocket and packed it with angry jabs of his age-spotted hand.

Rated R: contains violence, strong language, and counting coup.
