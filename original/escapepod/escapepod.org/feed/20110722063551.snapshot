Stone Wall Truth
by Caroline M. Yoachim

Njeri sewed the woman together with hairs from a zebra tail.  Her deer-bone needle dipped under the womanrsquo;s skin and bobbed back out.  The contrast of the white seams against her dark skin was striking.

ldquo;The center seam makes a straight line,rdquo; Njeri told her apprentice, ldquo;but the others flow with the natural curves of the body, just as the Enshai River follows the curve of the landscape.rdquo;

Odion leaned in to examine her work, his breath warm on the back of her neck.  Foolish boy, wasting his attention on her.  Njeri set her needle on the table and stood up to stretch.  The job was nearly done -- shersquo;d repositioned the womanrsquo;s organs, reconstructed her muscles, sewn her body back together.  Only the face was still open, facial muscles splayed out in all directions from the womanrsquo;s skull like an exotic flower in full bloom.

ldquo;Why sew them back together, after the wall?rdquo; Odion asked.  ldquo;Why not let them die?rdquo;



Njeri sighed.  The boy had steady hands and a sharp mind, but his heart was unforgiving.  He had been eager to learn about the cutting, about the delicate art of preparing a patient to hang from the wall.  What he questioned was the sewing, the part of the work that had drawn Njeri to this calling.  She studied the woman on the table -- the last surviving grandchild of Radmalende, who had been king when the country was ruled by kings instead of warlords.  The two of them had come of age the same spring, and had taken their adulthood rites together.  That had been many years ago, but it was hard for Njeri not to think of her childhood friend by name.  ldquo;You think I should leave her to die?rdquo;

ldquo;Her bones were black as obsidian.rdquo;  He traced the center seam with his finger.

Njeri said nothing.  She admired the woman for her strength; she hadnrsquo;t cried or protested or made excuses.  Few women were put on the wall, but this one had faced it as bravely as any man, braver than some.  And her shadowself had been like nothing Njeri had ever seen.  Dark, of course, but a tightly controlled blackness, an army of ants marching out from her heart and along her bones.  A constantly shifting shadow that never rested too long in any one place.

ldquo;She made a play for the throne.  Killed six Maiwatu guardsmen in the process.  Her attack has opened the way for the Upyatu.  I heard a rumor today the capitol is still under siege.rdquo;  Odion masked the worry in his voice, but Njeri knew he was concerned.  He had many friends in the upper echelons of the ruling class -- it was how he came to be apprenticed to the highest ranking surgeon at the longest stretch of wall.

ldquo;There is always unrest in the capitol.rdquo;  Njeri didnrsquo;t add that this woman had a stronger claim to the citrine throne than most.  ldquo;Besides, itrsquo;s not our place to say what people deserve.  General Bahtir pays us to take people apart and put them back together, not to judge them.rdquo;

Njeri nudged Odion aside.  She settled back into her stool, and he went outside to set some water boiling for tea.  He didnrsquo;t appreciate being pushed away, didnrsquo;t understand why she didnrsquo;t want him the way he wanted her.  She wanted to tell the boy to find someone his own age, someone who liked boys, but Odion wouldnrsquo;t listen.  Njeri returned to her work.  The womanrsquo;s jawbone hung slack below her skull, but her mouth still closed around the clear stone that held her mind while Njeri patched her body together.  The womanrsquo;s eyes stared up at the thatched straw roof, empty, with nothing but bone surround...</itunes:summary>

Episode 300! Wow!

We Go Back
Tim Pratt

My best friend Jenny Kay climbed in through my window and nearly stepped on my head. If I'd been sleeping a foot closer to the wall, I would've gotten a face full of her boot, but instead I just snapped awake and said "What who what now?" and blinked a lot.

"Oh damn," Jenny said in a loudish whisper. "When did you move your bed under the window?"

"Last week," I said, sitting up in bed. "I wanted a change." If you can't rearrange your life, you can at least rearrange yourself, and if your mom won't let you dye your hair blue, you can make do with rearranging your rooms.

Jenny Kay dropped from standing to sitting in one motion, making my mattress bounce, and landed cross-legged and totally comfortable. "Hey," she said. "So I need to borrow your ring." I couldn't read her expression in the dim moonlight from the window.

I looked at my right hand, where a thin silver ring looped my index finger, catching what light there was in the room and giving back twinkles. The metal grew cold against my skin and tightened a fraction, almost a friendly little squeeze. The ring -- which wasn't really a ring -- could tell when I was thinking about it. "Uh," I said.

Jenny nodded vigorously, a motion I felt in the jostling of the mattress more than I saw. "I know! I know. But I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important. I mean, you've had the thing for more than a year, and I've never asked once if I could use it, right?"

I glanced at my closed door -- no glow under the crack at the bottom, which meant my parents had gone to their separate beds and turned out the hall light -- and switched on my bedside lamp. Jenny was dressed in jeans and a sweater, all in dark grays and blacks, not her usual aggressively flamboyant colorful mishmash style at all. Good for sneaking into people's windows, I guessed.

I sat up against the headboard, because when you're about to annoy your best friend, it's better not to be flat on your back at the time. "I wish I could," I said -- not one hundred percent true, but Jenny was a fourteen-year-old genius, not a human lie detector. "But it's, like... part of me. You know? I'm part of the mechanism. I can't just take it off. It's linked into my, what's it called, socratic nervous system?"

"Somatic," Jenny said gloomily. She was almost as good at biology as she was at math. "The part of your nervous system that controls movement, which sort of halfway makes sense, I guess."

I shrugged. "So, there you go. The ring's not something I wear. It's something that wears me.  Or we wear each other. What did you want it for?"



She looked away. "Nothing. An errand."

I sighed. "Tell me, Jay Kay. Maybe I can help. Is it about a boy?"

Jenny just bit her lip. Good enough. The past few months it's pretty much always been about a boy.

I took her hand. Me and Jenny go way back, and whenever I say that, older people laugh, because I'm fifteen and she's fourteen, and they're like, you're too young to even have a "way back." But I've known Jenny since she skipped first grade and ended up in my second-grade class, which means I've been her best friend for about half my life, and how many of you old people have a friendship with that kind of percentage? She used to hide me in her basement when things got too bad and I ran away from home, and she's the reason I've never failed a math or science class. I owe her. I'm not saying I'd kill for her or anything, but I mean, I like to think I'd help her bury the bodies.

"Okay," I said. "I'll help. Where are we going?"

"I don't want to get you into any trouble," she said. "It's my problem, I should really deal with it myself."

I shrugged. "Mom stopped doing the middle-of-the-night spot checks mo</itunes:summary>

This month wersquo;re bringing you short story and novella nominees for the Hugo awards, one of the two big Science Fiction and Fantasy awards alongside the Nebula. The Nebulas are awarded by members of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, and the Hugos by the attendees of Worldcon. The Nebularsquo;s were awarded in May, and wersquo;ll find out who wins the Hugos next month at Renovation in Reno, Nevada.

Itrsquo;s always been more than a bit amusing to me to see the inevitable lsquo;That got nominated? The [insert award name] is losing itrsquo; comments cropping up on our forums and elsewhere. As if the Nebulas and Hugos are awarded by some wise men up on the crags, parsing the yearrsquo;s crop of stories against the awardrsquo;s prior canon. The nominations and awards come from a large swath of fandom or onersquo;s fellow writers, and therersquo;s always going to be elements of friendship, politics, fervent loyalty, and emotion in these endeavors.

And yet, the nominating crowds for both pick stories that are good, and worth reading. You wonrsquo;t like all of them, but yoursquo;ll like a lot of them, and that is really the best you can hope for. Fiction is not nearly so varied as fiction readers, and the point of these things is to make sure good stories get the biggest audience then can.

Which is also the point of Soundproof. People write into us about having friends that canrsquo;t stand hearing stories, or who have a deaf spouse, or they just prefer to read.

The point of Escape Pod is getting as many good stories out to as many ears and eyes (or fingers, if anyonersquo;s feeding this into one of those Braille boxes) as possible, which is why wersquo;ve worked hard to keep things free, taking advertising when we like the advertiser, and being ever thankful to those of you who donate. We couldnrsquo;t do it without you. (Which is why Dave Thompson and Wilson Fowlie have been working hard to bring those who donate the Alphabet Quartet as a thank you.)

Hopefully one of the Hugo nominees in this issue will get the shiny, shiny rocket ship next month. Theyrsquo;re all worthy of it, even if they are [insert ghastly sub-genre].

		<description><![CDATA[<i>Geist</i>, by Philippa Ballantine, combines the best of what I like in 1990s fantasy fiction with the scope of a doorstop novel... and then pares out all the extraneous crap that makes a fantasy novel into a doorstop. It's an enjoyable book to read, even if it's got a few too many tropes that we've all read before.]]></description>

Plus Or Minus

By James Patrick Kelly

Everything changed once Beep found out that Mariskarsquo;s mother was the famous Natalya Volochkova.nbsp;nbsp; Mariskarsquo;s life aboard the Shining Legend went immediately from bad to awful.nbsp; Even before he singled her out, she had decided that there was no way shersquo;d be spending the rest of her teen years crewing on an asteroid bucket.nbsp; Once Beep started persecuting her, she began counting down the remaining days of the run as if she were a prisoner.nbsp; She tried explaining that she had no use for Natalya Volochkova, who had never been much of a mother to her, but Beep wouldnrsquo;t hear it.nbsp; He didnrsquo;t care that Mariska had only signed on to the Shining Legend to get back at her mother for ruining her life.

Somehow that hadnrsquo;t worked out quite the way she had planned.

For example, there was crud duty.nbsp; With a twisting push Mariska sailed into the command module, caught herself on a handrail, and launched toward the starboard wall.nbsp; The racks ofnbsp; instrument screens chirped and beeped and buzzed; command was one of the loudest mods on the ship.nbsp; She stuck her landing in front of navigation rack and her slippers caught on the deck burrs, anchoring her in the shiprsquo;snbsp; .0006 gravity.nbsp;nbsp; Sure enough, she could see new smears of mold growing from the crack where the nav screen fit into the wall.nbsp; This was Beeprsquo;s fault, although he would never admit it.nbsp; He kept the humidity jacked up in Command, said that dry air gave him nosebleeds.nbsp; Richard FiveFord claimed they came from all the drugs Beep sniffed but Mariska didnrsquo;t want to believe that.nbsp; Also Beep liked to sip his coffee from a cup instead sucking it out of a bag, even though he slopped all the time.nbsp; Fungi loved the sugary spatters.nbsp; She sniffed one particularly vile looking smear of mold.nbsp; It smelled faintly like the worms she used to grow back home on the Moon.nbsp; She wiped her nose with the sleeve of her jersey and reached to the holster on her belt for her sponge. As she scrubbed, the bitter vinegar tang of disinfectant gel filled the mod.nbsp; Not for the first time, she told herself that this job stunk.

She felt the tingle of Richard FiveFord offering a mindfeed and opened her head.nbsp; =What?=

His feed made a pleasant fizz behind her eyes, distracting her. =You done any time soon?=nbsp; Distraction was Richardrsquo;s specialty

=No.=

=Didit is making a dream for us.=



She slapped her sponge at the wall in frustration.nbsp; =This sucks.=nbsp; Mariska couldnrsquo;t remember the last time Didit or Richard FiveFord had pulled crud duty.

=Should we wait for you?=

=If you want.=nbsp; But she knew they wouldnrsquo;t. =Might be another hour.=

ldquo;Yoursquo;re working, Volochkova.rdquo; Beeprsquo;s voice crackled over the loudspeaker.nbsp; One of his quirks was snooping their private feeds and then yelling at them over the shiprsquo;s com.

ldquo;Yes, sir,rdquo; she said.nbsp; Beep liked to be called sir.nbsp; It made him feel like the captain of the Shining Legend instead of senior monkey of its maintenance crew.

ldquo;Shersquo;s working, FiveFord.nbsp; Leave our sweet young thing alone.rdquo;

She felt Richardrsquo;s feed pop like a bubble.nbsp; He was more afraid of Beep than she was even though the old crank hardly ever bullied Richard.nbsp; Mariska hated being called sweet young thing.nbsp; She wasnrsquo;t sweet and she wasnrsquo;t all that young.nbsp; She was already fifteen in conscious years, eighteen if you counted the time she had hibernated.

When Mariska finished wiping th...</itunes:summary>

The Things
By Peter Watts

I am being Blair. I escape out the back as the world comes in through the front.

I am being Copper. I am rising from the dead.

I am being Childs. I am guarding the main entrance.

The names don't matter. They are placeholders, nothing more; all biomass is interchangeable. What matters is that these are all that is left of me. The world has burned everything else.

I see myself through the window, loping through the storm, wearing Blair. nbsp;MacReady has told me to burn Blair if he comes back alone, but MacReady still thinks I am one of him. I am not: I am being Blair, and I am at the door. I am being Childs, and I let myself in. I take brief communion, tendrils writhing forth from my faces, intertwining: I am BlairChilds, exchanging news of the world.

The world has found me out. It has discovered my burrow beneath the tool shed, the half-finished lifeboat cannibalized from the viscera of dead helicopters. The world is busy destroying my means of escape. Then it will come back for me.

There is only one option left. I disintegrate. Being Blair, I go to share the plan with Copper and to feed on the rotting biomass once called  Clarke ; so many changes in so short a time have dangerously depleted my reserves. Being Childs, I have already consumed what was left of Fuchs and am replenished for the next phase. nbsp;I sling the flamethrower onto my back and head outside, into the long Antarctic night.

I will go into the storm, and never come back.

#

I was so much more, before the crash. I was an explorer, an ambassador, a missionary. I spread across the cosmos, met countless worlds, took communion: the fit reshaped the unfit and the whole universe bootstrapped upwards in joyful, infinitesimal increments. I was a soldier, at war with entropy itself. I was the very hand by which Creation perfects itself.

So much wisdom I had. So much experience. Now I cannot remember all the things I knew. I can only remember that I once knew them.

I remember the crash, though. It killed most of this offshoot outright, but a little crawled from the wreckage: a few trillion cells, a soul too weak to keep them in check. Mutinous biomass sloughed off despite my most desperate attempts to hold myself together: panic-stricken little clots of meat, instinctively growing whatever limbs they could remember and fleeing across the burning ice. By the time I'd regained control of what was left the fires had died and the cold was closing back in. I barely managed to grow enough antifreeze to keep my cells from bursting before the ice took me.

I remember my reawakening, too: dull stirrings of sensation in real time, the first embers of cognition, the slow blooming warmth of awareness as body and soul embraced after their long sleep. I remember the biped offshoots surrounding me, the strange chittering sounds they made, the odd  uniformity  of their body plans. How ill-adapted they looked! How  inefficient  their morphology! Even disabled, I could see so many things to fix. So I reached out. I took communion. I tasted the flesh of the worldmdash;

mdash;and the world attacked me. It  attacked  me.

I left that place in ruins. It was on the other side of the mountainsmdash;the  Norwegian camp , it is called heremdash;and I could never have crossed that distance in a biped skin. Fortunately there was another shape to choose from, smaller than the biped but better adapted to the local climate. I hid within it while the rest of me fought off the attack. I fled into the night on four legs, and let the rising flames cover my escape.

I did not stop running until I...</itunes:summary>

Amaryllis
By Carrie Vaughn

I never knew my mother, and I never understood why she did what she did. I ought to be grateful that she was crazy enough to cut out her implant so she could get pregnant. But it also meant she was crazy enough to hide the pregnancy until termination wasnrsquo;t an option, knowing the whole time that shersquo;d never get to keep the baby. That shersquo;d lose everything. That her household would lose everything because of her.

I never understood how she couldnrsquo;t care. I wondered what her family thought when they learned what shersquo;d done, when their committee split up the household, scattered themmdash;broke them, because of her.

Did she think I was worth it?
#

It was all about quotas.

ldquo;Theyrsquo;re using cages up north, I heard. Off shore, anchored,rdquo; Nina said. ldquo;Fifty feet acrossmdash;twice as much protein grown with half the resources, and wersquo;d never have to touch the wild population again. We could double our quota.rdquo;

I hadnrsquo;t really been listening to her. We were resting, just for a moment; she sat with me on the railing at the prow of Amaryllis and talked about her big plans.

Wind pulled the sails taut and the fiberglass hull cut through waves without a sound, we sailed so smooth. Garrett and Sun hauled up the nets behind us, dragging in the catch. Amaryllis was elegant, a 30-foot sleek vessel with just enough cabin and cargo spacemdash;an antique but more than seaworthy. She was a good boat, with a good crew. The best.

ldquo;Mariemdash;rdquo; Nina said, pleading.

I sighed and woke up. ldquo;Wersquo;ve been over this. We canrsquo;t just double our quota.rdquo;

ldquo;But if we got authorizationmdash;rdquo;

ldquo;Donrsquo;t you think wersquo;re doing all right as it is?rdquo; We had a good crewmdash;we were well fed and not exceeding our quotas; I thought wersquo;d be best off not screwing all that up. Not making waves, so to speak.

Ninarsquo;s big brown eyes filled with tearsmdash;Irsquo;d said the wrong thing, because I knew what she was really after, and the status quo wasnrsquo;t it.

ldquo;Thatrsquo;s just it,rdquo; she said. ldquo;Wersquo;ve met our quotas and kept everyone healthy for years now. I really think we should try. We can at least ask, canrsquo;t we?rdquo;

The truth was: No, I wasnrsquo;t sure we deserved it. I wasnrsquo;t sure that kind of responsibility would be worth it. I didnrsquo;t want the prestige. Nina didnrsquo;t even want the prestigemdash;she just wanted the baby.

ldquo;Itrsquo;s out of our hands at any rate,rdquo; I said, looking away because I couldnrsquo;t bear the intensity of her expression.

Pushing herself off the rail, Nina stomped down Amaryllisrsquo; port side to join the rest of the crew hauling in the catch. She wasnrsquo;t old enough to want a baby. She was lithe, fit, and golden, running barefoot on the deck, sun-bleached streaks gleaming in her brown hair. Actually, no, she was old enough. Shersquo;d been with the house for seven yearsmdash;she was twenty, now. It hadnrsquo;t seemed so long.

ldquo;Whoa!rdquo; Sun called. There was a splash and a thud as something in the net kicked against the hull. He leaned over the side, the muscles along his broad, coppery back flexing as he clung to a net that was about to slide back into the water. Nina, petite next to his strong frame, reached with him. I ran down and grabbed them by the waistbands of their trousers to hold them steady. The fourth of our crew, Garrett, latched a boat hook into the net. Together we hauled the catch onto the deck. Wersquo;d caught something big, heavy, and full of powerful muscles.

For Want of a Nail
By Mary Robinette Kowal

With one hand, Rava adjusted the VR interface glasses where they bit into the bridge of her nose, while she kept her other hand buried in Cordeliarsquo;s innards. There was scant room to get the flexible shaft of a mono-lens and her hand through the access hatch in the AIrsquo;s chassis. From the next compartment, drums and laughter bled through the plastic walls of the ship, indicating her sisterrsquo;s conception party was still in full swing.

With only a single camera attached, the interface glasses didnrsquo;t give Rava depth perception as she struggled to replug the transmitter cable. The chassis had not been designed to need repair. At all. It had been designed to last hundreds of years without an upgrade.

If Rava couldnrsquo;t get the cable plugged in and working, Cordelia wouldnrsquo;t be able to download backups of herself to her long-term memory. She couldnrsquo;t store more than a week at a time in active memory. It would be the same as a slow death sentence.

The square head of the cable slipped out of Ravarsquo;s fingers. Again. ldquo;Dammit!rdquo; She slammed her heel against the shiprsquo;s floor in frustration.

ldquo;If you canrsquo;t do it, let someone else try.rdquo; Her older brother, Ludoviko, had insisted on following her out of the party as if he could help.

ldquo;You know, this would go a lot faster if you werenrsquo;t breathing down my neck.rdquo;

ldquo;You know, you wouldnrsquo;t be doing this at all if you hadnrsquo;t dropped her.rdquo;



Rava resisted the urge to pull the mono-lens out of the jack in her glasses and glare at him. He might have gotten better marks in school, but she was the AIrsquo;s wrangler. ldquo;Why donrsquo;t you go back to the party and see if you can learn something about fertility?rdquo; She lifted the cable head and tried one more time.

ldquo;Why, you littlemdash;rdquo; Rage choked his voice, more than she had expected from a random slam. She made a guess that his appeal to the repro-council didnrsquo;t go well.

Cordeliarsquo;s voice cut in, stopping what he was going to say. ldquo;Itrsquo;s not Ravarsquo;s fault. I did ask her to pick me up.rdquo;

ldquo;Yeah.rdquo; Rava focused on the cable, trying to get it aligned.

ldquo;Right.rdquo; Ludoviko snorted. ldquo;And then you dropped yourself.rdquo;

Cordelia sighed and Rava could almost imagine breath tickling her skin. ldquo;If yoursquo;re going to blame anyone, blame Branson Conchord for running into her.rdquo;

Rava didnrsquo;t bother answering. Theyrsquo;d been having the same conversation for the last hour and Cordelia should know darn well what Ludovikorsquo;s answer would be.

Like programming, he said, ldquo;It was irresponsible. She should have said no. The room was full of intoxicated, rowdy people and you are too valuable an asset.rdquo;

Rava rested her head against the smooth wood side of the AIrsquo;s chassis and closed her eyes, ignoring her brother and the flat picture in her goggles. Her fingers rolled the slick plastic head of the cable, building a picture in her mind of the white square and the flat gold cord stretching from it. She slid the cable forward until it jarred against the socket. Rotating the head, Rava focused all her attention on the tiny clues of friction vibrating up her arm. This was a simple, comprehensible problem.

She didnrsquo;t want to think about what would happen if she couldnrsquo;t repair the damage.

Being unable to download her old memories meant Cordelia would have to delete herself bit by bit to keep functioning. All because Rava had asked if she wanted to dance. At least Ludoviko hadnrsquo;t heard that part...</itunes:summary>

We kept in touch through the war, when he messaged me about marching through upstate New York.  He always started the same way:  "Dear Ryan, Please come kick my commanding officer in the balls."  Then he'd tell me about the latest mess--cracks in their radiation suits, or toxic waterholes that were supposed to be clear.  He never got in trouble for the messages; they needed him too badly.  My epilepsy disqualified me from the draft, which probably saved my life.  Pretty boys like me weren't exactly Army material.  By the time things were bad enough that they needed any warm body, there wasn't enough human government left to organize a draft.

The ruins at Binghamton were where Trey got sick.  By the time I got across the country to him, he'd recovered--well, as much as possible.  I remember the doctor's face as he says Trey will live, but he'll be in pain.</itunes:summary>

Hello Gentle Listenersmdash;

May brought us the announcement of the Hugo Awards nominees, which means that June is Hugo Month! For years, Escape Pod has been buying the rights to most of the Hugo short story nominees, and this year is no different. Wersquo;ll be featuring three of the four nominees, and since June has five Thursdays, we will also be featuring two longer stories that got Nebula and/or Hugo nods!

We also have the ebook rights to the stories, which is an Escape Pod first, so next monthrsquo;s Soundproof will be a collectorrsquo;s item. (If a digital file could be collectible. Which it canrsquo;t. So never mind. But you know what I mean; itrsquo;ll be cool.) Irsquo;m very excited to see our site growing so much.

We want to send extra special congrats to the podcasts who managed to make it onto the Hugo Ballot this year! 2010 winner for Best Fanzine, Starship Sofa, has gotten another nomination, and Writing Excuses has received a nod for Best Related Work. SSS has wonderful stories from many masters of SF, and Writing Excuses has wonderful discussions on how to write genre fiction. We are thrilled that these quality podcasts are getting attention from fandom. Irsquo;ll be reporting from WorldCon in two and a half months, and liveblogging the Hugo Awards. More info soon!

A question we get a lot of is, ldquo;Why do you not have all the stories in your PDF?rdquo; The answer is simple- audio and ebook rights are purchased separately, and sometimes an author cannot or will not grant us both rights. Or there are stories wersquo;ve purchased before we started purchasing ebook rights, so we have no right to give you text versions of the stories. We take our authorsrsquo; rights very seriously and will only release the format for which we have rights. Audio-only stories are fewer and fewer these days, but there still will be an occasional one in our future feed.

Speaking of the feed, some people have asked that the Soundproof Escape Pod have its own feed, or the audio have its own feed. Or the R stories to have their own feed. We get this question a lot and canrsquo;t really create custom feeds for each listener - but never fear, there is a solution. Irsquo;d like to point you to a page that gives you some RSS options, including some things you can do to custom make your own EP feed.

From How To Subscribe (http://escapepod.org/subscribe/):

You can make your own special Escape Pod feed by subscribing to http://www.escapepod.org/category/XXXX/feed where you replace XXXX with the category you want to subscribe to. Categories are listed on the front page in a drop-down box on the right. Have at it!

Lastly, in order to get the submissions under control, wersquo;re taking two months off and closing for submissions on June 6th.

We hope you enjoy this issue, chock full of awesome stories, reviews, and Nebula reporting. We hope you have a wonderful summer (or winter, if yoursquo;re on the other side of the world) and keep listening! We will have other announcements next month!

		<itunes:summary>From Dave Thompson, the co-editor at our sister podcast, Podcastle:
In late 2007, I took a trip down to San Diego's Conjecture convention. I'd been listening to Escape Pod for a couple of years (PodCastle hadn't even started yet) and so I was thrilled that the very first panel I got to see featured Tim Pratt, Heather Shaw, and Greg van Eekhout. Tim had just won a Hugo for his story "Impossible Dreams" (which I first heard at Escape Pod, yo!) and proceeded to do a collaborative reading of ABC flash fiction. Essentially, they divvied up the alphabet, wrote flash fiction stories for each letter, such as "E is for Excrement" and "N is for Nevermore Nevermore Land." It was a fantastic reading - hilarious, poignant, thrilling, and most of all - they knew how to have fun. I left the convention knowing, just knowing, that one day - this ABC book was going to be big.

But nothing happened. Several years passed, and still - nothing happened.

And then, toward the end of last year - I realized, I'm at Escape Artists, co-editing PodCastle, and that awesome book I remember? Is out there still, and nobody's heard it. So, I talked to Ben Phillips, and then I talked to Tim, Heather, Greg, and Jenn Reese - who came aboard to help them finish up the collection - and we came up with a plan. I decided it'd be awesome to send the Alphabet Quartet out to listeners who'd been kind enough to sign up as paid subscribers or make a one-time donation to us of $50 or more since January 1, 2011. Times are tough, we know, and not everyone can donate, so all the Escape Artists podcasts are going to be sharing a few of these stories with everyone who wants them (and also at the Drabblecast). Additionally, all the stories are available to read there for free at Daily Science Fiction, a great new online magazine that emails you free SF/F stories daily, so everyone wins. Thanks for listening, and we hope you enjoy the extra stories.</itunes:summary>

The Night Train
By Lavie Tidhar

Her name wasn't Molly and she didn't wear shades, reflective or otherwise.

She was watching the length of the platform.

Hua Lamphong at dusk: a warm wind blowing through the open platforms where the giant beasts puffed smoke and steam into the humid air, the roof of the train station arching high overhead.

Her name wasn't Noi, either, in case you asked, though it's a common enough name. It wasn't Porn, or Ping. It wasn't even Friday.

She was watching the platform, scanning passengers climbing aboard, porters shifting wares, uniformed police patrolling at leisure. She was there to watch out for the Old Man.

She wasn't even a girl. Not exactly. And as for why the Old Man was called the Old Mannbsp;.nbsp;.nbsp;.

He was otherwise known as Boss Gui: head andnbsp;bigfala bos of the Kunming Toads. She got the job when she'd killed Gui's Toad bodyguardsmdash;by default, as it were.

But that had happened back in Kunming. This was Bangkok, Bangkok at duskmdash;this was Hua Lamphong, greatest of train stations, where the great slugs breathed steam and were rubbed and scrubbed by the slug-boys whose job it was to nurture them before departure. And the Old Man wasn't exactly an old man, either.

Scanning, waiting for the Old Man to arrive: Yankee tourists with in-built cams flashing as they posed besides the great beasts, these neo-nagas of reconstituted DNA, primitive nervous system, and prodigious appetite. Scanning: a group of Martian-Chinese from Tong Yun City walking cautiouslymdash;unused to the heavier gravity of this home/planet. Scanning: three Malay businessmenmdash;Earth-Belt Corp. standardized reinforced skeletonsmdash;they moved gracefully, like dancersmdash;wired through and through, hooked up twenty-four Earth-hours an Earth-day, seven Earth-days a week to the money-form engines, the great pulsating web of commerce and data, that singing, Sol-system-wide, von Neumann-machine expanded network of networks of networks.nbsp;.nbsp;.nbsp;.

Wired with hidden weaponry, too: she made a note of that.

An assassin can take many shapes. It could be the sweet old lady carrying two perfectly balanced baskets of woven bamboo over her shoulders, each basket filled with sweet addictive fried Vietnamese bananas. It could be the dapper K-pop starlet with her entourage, ostensibly here to rough it a bit for the hovering cameras. It could be the couple of French backpackersmdash;he with long thinning silver hair and a cigarette between his lips, she with a new face courtesy of Soi Cowboy's front-and-back street cosmetic surgeriesmdash;baby-doll face, but the hands never lie and the hands showed her true age, in the lines etched there, the drying of the skin, the quick-bitten nails polished a cheap redmdash;

An assassin could be anyone. A Yankee rich kid on a retro-trip across Asia, readingnbsp;Air America ornbsp;Neuromancer in a genuine reproduction 1984 POD-paperback; it could be the courteous policeman helping a pretty young Lao girl with her luggage; it could be the girl herselfmdash;an Issan farmer's daughter exported to Bangkok in a century-long tradition, body augmented with vibratory vaginal inserts, perfect audio/visual-to-export, always-on record, a carefully tended Louis Wu habit and an as-carefully-tended retirement planmdash;make enough money, get back home to Issannbsp;wan bigfala mama, open up a bar/hotel/bookshop and spend your days on the Mekong, waxing lyrical about the good old days, listening to Thai pop and K-pop and Nuevo Kwasa-Kwasa, growing misty-eyed nostalgic.nbsp;.nbsp;.nbsp;.

Could be anyone. She waited for the Old Man to arrive. The trains in Hua Lamphong never left on time.

Her name before, or after, doesn't matter. They used to call her Mulan Rouge, whi...</itunes:summary>

A Small Matter, Really
By  Monte Cook

Only the Catholic Church of Osirus would have enough money to afford not one, but two black holes.  Standing within the majestic narthex, Maria McNaki imagined the vibration of  complex machinery under her feet, despite the fact that the nanosensors laced  into her flesh revealed nothing other than the passing of the people in the  crowd and the chanting coming from deeper within the  cathedral.

The stone walls of the  chamber slowly flowed with a liquid relief of gothic circuitry and religious  hieroglyphic animations. The glyph depicting Setan as he tore the crucified  Osirus-Christ into tiny fragments malfunctioned and remained static. Just as  well. The petitioners around her made carefully devout hand signs over their  hearts as they faced the ankh crucifix over the door into the  sanctuary.

Religion was back in  fashion this season.

Three identical priests  stood next to the holy water fonts, welcoming the incoming congregation. Their  white collars and black robes stood starched-still. Geneticists form-shaped all  Catholic-Osirus priests into the gentle, fatherly form selected by church PR,  but these three were special. The bright eyes and the shining hair indicated Aesthicel, the most expensive genengineering firm in the Earth system. This  parish liked to spend money.

Perfect. That most  likely meant that they were interested in obtaining more.



Terrence told her that  the facility lay underneath the cathedral. Maria made her way past the incoming  worshipers as quickly and politely as she could.

Stout-of-Heart mewled  behind her, trying to keep up. The alienrsquo;s appearance disturbed a few in the  crowd, and Maria realized that bringing him might not have been the best idea  after all. The four-foot, shaggy bramagian bore the minder headband that marked  him as a trained urban bodyguard, but his claws and tusks still instilled fear  in many humans. The headband also allowed the creature to access a private data  field that existed only between the two of them. Through it, Maria could  communicate with him. Nevertheless, she preferred it much better when Piotr had  tended to the bramagian.

ldquo;Lord, what is this  place?rdquo; Stout-of-Heart asked her. She hated being called Lord, but the  bramagians were so fiercely misogynistic that it was best if they thought of all  humans as male. Maria had no idea how to explain the church to Stout-of-Heart.  Bramagians taken by humans from their homeworld already believed that they were  in Heaven, walking among the gods. If she told him that the gods also worshipped  gods, it might be too much for him. Among the bramagians, madness was a fate  worse than death.

ldquo;Never mind,  Stout-of-Heart,rdquo; she uploaded into their link. ldquo;Itrsquo;s too difficult to explain.rdquo;  Her assurances would only work for so long. Although the aliens were happy to be  warriors in Heaven, they were intensely curious about everything they  encountered there.

Elevator doors stood  closed to the right of the sanctuary entrance. More boy than man, a guard stood  in front of them, arms folded as if he could possibly appear menacing. He wore  black robes but no priestly collar and his temple sported a removable receiver  implant. Maria knew better than to be deceived by looks. Muscle-augmentation,  hidden disrupters or even nanite drones could all be concealed. Instead, she  produced her most powerful weapon as she approached the slight guard--a  cashstick keyed to more than this man made in a month.

He stepped aside with a  smile, and the lift doors opened. Maria entered the elevator and whispered ldquo;all  the way down,rdquo; to the man with a smile of her own and a nod. Stout-of-Heart  followed her in, and the doors closed. She smoothed ...</itunes:summary>

In the Water
by Katherine Mankiller

Yvonne looked up from her monitor, the beads in her cornrows clattering as Roger walked into her office.

Roger sat in the dark wooden chair opposite her desk.  "Weren't you assigned Alice van Buuren?"

"Oh, no you don't," Yvonne said.  "You can't have her."  Yvonne hadn't been assigned Alice; she'd requested her.  Alice was probably the only murder victim's wife she would ever meet. They hadn't even put the murder in the papers.  Maybe they thought there'd be a panic.

"Please," Roger said.  "I'm just trying to save you some trouble. I've already spoken to her, and..."

Yvonne crossed her arms and glared.  "Wouldn't you raise hell if I talked to one of your patients behind your back?"

"She's refusing modern therapy.  What are you going to do, use the old-fashioned techniques your grandmother used?"

Roger had a lot of nerve mentioning Grandma.  Yvonne glanced at the photo on the corner of her desk.  Grandma Jackson had been a big woman, with braids down to her hips and skin like chocolate.  Grandma Jackson smiled back at the camera, all reassuring good nature.

Roger said, "I think we should just wipe her and have done with it."

"Too bad she's not your patient," Yvonne said.



"I could take her away from you, you know."

"Don't you dare!"

There was an awkward silence.

"It'll be less confusing for her if I come with you," Roger said. "Just to hand her off to you.  You understand."

"Fine," Yvonne said.  "Whatever."

"Good girl," Roger said, and Yvonne gritted her teeth.  "Room 314." He stood.  "Let's go."

"Now?" Yvonne said.  She picked up her coffee and almost took a sip, then put it down again, making a face.  It was cold, and it had been so bitter hot that she'd taken caffeine pills with orange juice instead.

Roger snorted.  "That bad?"

Roger clearly wasn't going anywhere, so Yvonne stood, picked up her jacket, and followed Roger out of her office.  The halls were white to the point of being blinding after her calm, earth-toned office, and reeked of disinfectant.

They went upstairs and over to room 314.  Roger placed his hand on the identification plate and the door slid open.

"Hello, Alice," Roger said.

The patient, a skinny, pale woman with brown hair, backed away from Roger.  She reminded Yvonne of someone, although she couldn't put her finger on whom.

The patient fell into a seated position on the bed, mouth open, staring at Yvonne.  Before Yvonne could say anything, Roger said, "This is Doctor Jackson.  Doctor Jackson, this is Alice."

"We're not going to hurt you," Yvonne said.

The patient--Alice--stared at Yvonne for a moment, then shut her mouth.  She shot Roger a defiant look.

"I'll just leave you to it," Roger said, and left.

"Hello, Alice," Yvonne said.  "You can call me Yvonne if you prefer."

"We've met," Alice said.  It wasn't a question.

Alice really did look familiar. "Refresh my memory?"

"It doesn't matter," Alice said and looked away.

There was an uncomfortable silence.

Yvonne said, "Dr. Hill said you're refusing drug therapy."

"I had a negative reaction once," Alice said.

"Really?" Yvonne said.  "Usually that's associated with an interaction with an unapproved drug.  You should be fine this time; your blood tests came back clean."

"I wasn't on anything then, either," Alice said.

"That's very unusual," Yvonne said.

Alice shrugged.  "Just weird, I guess."

"He also said you object to memory modification."

Alice started to cry.

For a moment Yvonne just wanted to hug Alice and let her cry, but negative emotions caused crime.  It wasn't right to encourage Alice to carry on.  "You won't forget your marriage.  We'll just erase the trauma of his murder.  We can come up wit</itunes:summary>

Hello Allmdash;

We have listeners all over, and some of them will be heading into the winter months, but where I am spring has finally shook off the claws of winter.

But in the slice of science fiction fandom we all inhabit, spring is really notable for the return of Doctor Who to the airwaves, and thankfully for US fans, it is far closer to simultaneous transmission now that it has been the last few seasons. Physical distance matters less and less for communication, which in practice means that it is incredibly annoying to be in the US and looking at a twitter stream full of UK tweets about what the Doctorrsquo;s been on about that week. Spoilers suck (sweetie).

And speaking of the UK, we were very lucky and happy to run an interview with Lauren Beukes, who won this yearrsquo;s Arthur C. Clarke award for her novel Zoo City. Itrsquo;s available in an audio episode on our website, along with a (still audio) excerpt from thenbsp; book.

This month we were happy to bring you six stories, three of them flash. We ran three of the four honorable mentions from our flash contest fiction, which we should have done well before this. The forth and the three outright winners of the contest should be following in fairly close order.

We also brought you Abby Goldsmithrsquo;s A Taste Of Time, LaShawn Wanakrsquo;s Future Perfect, and Larry Hodgesrsquo; Tom the Universe. If you didnrsquo;t already listen to the on the lsquo;cast, I implore you to flick, scroll, click, or otherwise navigate several pages further in this to read them.

Until next month,

mdash;Bill

Tom the Universe
by Larry Hodges

I permeate this universe, which  I've named Tom, and guard against its destruction. If someone had done that for  the universe I came from, then Mary, my sweet Mary, would still be alive, and I wouldn't have killed her and everyone else when I accidentally destroyed that  universe.

And now I'm on the verge of destroying much more.

My name is also Tom. I was an  undergrad in neuroscience at Johns  Hopkins University in Baltimore that January in 2040 when I made the  discovery that doomed us all. My field of study was cognitive science, the study  of human consciousness. What makes us aware of ourselves? Is it just the  biomechanical workings of the brain, or something else?

Sherlock Holmes said, "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the  truth." I spent countless hours in the lab eliminating the impossible, and there  didn't seem to be anything left, improbable or not. The interconnectivity  required for human consciousness to exist was just too many levels beyond what  was possible. By all rights, we should all be unconscious blobs of matter  mechanically going about our business as directed by electronic impulses from  the brain, with no more consciousness than a calculator. I suffered brain cramps  in the lab trying to figure out what improbables were left.

When I could think of nothing else to try, it was time to relax and let my subconscious figure it out. So I got out the Frisbee and called my lab partners.

Mary, Joey, and I--Tommy, as they called me--called ourselves the "ees."  I'd only met Mary when we'd started college, and adored how she laughed when I  explained my love for her in neurological terms, with dopamine and  neurotransmitters. We did everything together, or so I thought; classes and  labs, movies, and late-night bull sessions with pizza and ice cream, usually  followed by pints of morning coffee. Our future together was assured; as soon as  we graduated, we would get married. I'd even convinced her we should wear purity  rings--I had special ones made up with a brain emblem.

Joey and I grew up together on the same street, playing stickball and  videogames. He and I were going to be buddies for life.

Professor Wilson, our adviser, reluctantly let the three of us be lab  partners even though he said it's best not to put friends together. Amazingly,  we got a lot done when we weren't reading the neurology cartoons taped to the  walls or playing with Catzilla, the lab's iguana-bodied, cat-brained hybrid  mascot. And then came that morning when we went outside the lab on Charles Street to  toss the Frisbee around among the oak trees by the front steps. The fresh air  was an escape from the antiseptic stench of the lab.

"You throw like a girl!" Joey said when my toss to him banged against the  ground, way off line. He stood half a head taller than me, with that eternal  mischievous grin I'd known for twenty years. He was the only person in the world  who could get away with a ponytailed bouffant, which I would yank every  chance.

"Like a girl, huh?" Mary said, throwing the Frisbee as hard as she could  at Joey, who barely blocked it. Mary grabbed the rebound and faked another throw  while Joey cringed. "Want some more?" She was my sweet pixie, five feet of tiger  and spice, never still, never silent. Recently she'd taken to tying her long  blond hair in a ponytail like Joey, giving me a second target to yank. I was the  smart one, with a crew cut.

"Okay," Joey said, "you win. You both throw like girls!" Mary smacked  him with the frisbee again.

As we tossed it around, I became aware of my awareness of the Frisbee's location at any given moment. Somehow my mind tracked this and so many other  thi</itunes:summary>

Future Perfect
By LaShawn M. Wanak

I saw you at a party once. You stood by the bookshelf, reading a tattered volume on Proust. You wore an orange and yellow XTC shirt beneath brown flannel. I bumped your elbow by accident and you looked up, your eyes startling green.

I smiled and said, "Hi. I'm Nina."

"Hi. Eric."

I trailed behind you for the rest of the party. You introduced me to your friends and I laughed at their jokes. Twice, our sleeves brushed against each other.

Around two in the morning, you left with your friends. An hour later, I also left. I crossed the empty campus, humming under my breath, wondering if I'd ever see you again.

The watch on my arm beeped.

*

"This experiment will measure how small changes occurring before a certain event affect its outcome positively and negatively."

The chair is her creation. She bought the frame on impulse at a medical supply shop. The conical helmet, perforated with slender tubes, fits on top. Whenever she maneuvers her head beneath it, she thinks of the hair dryers at her mother's beauty salon. All those bulky astronaut bonnets lined in perfect rows, vibrating air molecules to a feverish pitch. She likes this scientific homage to her mother extracting time from thin air.

"Recording of the control event complete. Setting a change in a condition set slightly in the past. The goal of this first jump is to see if this will change the outcome of the event to a more positive circumstance."

She types on the laptop built into the armrest, then glances at the elaborate flowchart tacked upon the far wall of the laboratory. Written in
her own hand, neat and precise, equations and sums branch and connect like a roadmap of a probability highway.

She wonders which formula will have his lips pressing against hers.

"Test #1. Begin."

Read More...

*

I saw you at a party once. You stood next to Muriel, hair rumpled, clothes wrinkled. I had my hair permed that morning so it hung straight over my eyes. I wore tight-fitting jeans and a blue top with spaghetti straps.

I didn't speak to you, just hung out with a couple of my girlfriends. When "Atomic Dog" came on the stereo, I shimmied to the bookcase, shaking my hips and wiggling my butt. Only then I noticed you, you and your startling green eyes. You smiled and said, "Hi, there." Muriel looked over and pulled you from the room.

Later, while getting punch, I looked out the window and saw you and Muriel standing on the sidewalk below. She cupped your face, pulling it down to meet hers. I thought, Shame. He had nice eyes.

Then someone stepped on my foot and I swore, loudly. As the guy next to me apologized, the watch on my arm beeped.

You went on to have three children with Muriel. It took several years until I said yes to Brenton.

*

She rises from the chair, pulling the sensors from her body. She takes a sip of lukewarm coffee and frowns at the chart on the wall.

The outcome remained the same, but that was to be expected. With so many variables, it will take time to narrow down the finite set of outcomes, both positive and negative. She isn't worried; after all, only two possible outcomes can come from this event.

She picks up a black magic marker and crosses off a number with an 'X'.

*

We came to the party together, your arm slung around my shoulders. You and I had met several weeks before. Within a week, we were dating. Within six weeks, we were an 'item'.

Muriel was there as well, dancing alone by the bookshelves. Though my hand was buried in your back pocket, you couldn't tear your eyes from her. I distracted you by pulling you over to introduce my friends. You nodded, laughed at someone's joke and glanced towards the corner.

A Taste of Time
by Abby Goldsmith

1.

On the night she turned twenty-nine, Jane sat on her narrow bed, watching TV and drinking alone.  She'd gone through a bottle of wine and was mostly through a second bottle.  Tomorrow morning would be painful.

Or she could stop worrying about tomorrow.  The ibuprofen in her cabinet kept popping into her mind.  Jane wasn't sure if all those pills chased by alcohol would be enough to end her life, but the idea of looking up how to commit suicide online seemed just too pathetic.

The front door of her tiny apartment creaked open.

Jane leaned forward, peering through her bedroom doorway.  A black wine bottle stood on the floor, with a placard dangling from its silver ribbon.

Her gaze immediately went to the deadbolt.  It was in place, as she'd left it.

Jane shut the TV off and listened for noises from the hallway.  All she heard were the sounds of Boston traffic outside.  Several weeks ago, after she'd come home to find her boyfriend screwing a fat chick on her couch, shersquo;d had the locks changed.  No one could have gotten in.

Yet the bottle sat mysteriously on the wooden floor.

At last, Jane crossed her apartment, checking every shadow for an intruder.

She picked up the bottle.  The placard had gilded letters, making it a potentially expensive gift.

Tabula Rasa
Warning: There Is No Return

Jane flipped the placard over twice, but nothing else was written on it.

She listened, alert for any noise.  Mystery had never been much a part of her adult life, and it gave her a strangely excited feeling.  If the warning label meant something like _poison_, it seemed like a more dignified way to go than pills and alcohol.

Her reflection on the black surface of the bottle was disturbingly clear.  There she was: Plain Jane, a frumpy woman with a double-chin and acne scars.

She unscrewed the cap and popped the foil underneath.  A stringent smell wafted up, making her wrinkle her nose and salivate at the same time.

"Happy birthday, Jane," she told herself, and swallowed a mouthful.

2.

Jane gagged on the sour taste in her mouth.  She was so dizzy, she'd fallen . . . but she was sitting in an office chair, with no memory whatsoever of leaving her dark and quiet apartment.

Florescent lights beat down on her, and the familiar voices of a call center surrounded her.  None of this was possible.  She was back at her old workplace.  It was a workday, late afternoon, judging by the angle of light.  Ultimata Insurance had laid her off months ago, yet here she was.

A man rapped his knuckles against Jane's desk.  "I gave you the files you needed, right?"  Her old boss, Moore, didn't bother to wait for a reply.  He was always in a hurry.  Jane barely started to nod before he rushed away.

The walls of her cubicle looked exactly the way she remembered.  There was the photograph of herself and mom.  There was the generic Ultimata calendar, flipped to October 2009 . . . Jane double-checked the year. 2009 was a full two years before the company downsized.  If this was October 2009, then she was still employed.

And still dating the jerk, Aaron.

Her fists tightened, and she realized that her hand was clamped around the black wine bottle.  She might lose her job more quickly this time, if they saw that.  She hid it beneath her desk.

"Jane!"

Jane swiveled to face Stephanie, who worked in the cubicle across from hers.  Stephanie was slim with bouncy golden hair, and never deigned to speak to plain Jane.

Stephanie hurried across into Jane's cubicle, giving a sneaky look both ways before crossing.  She beamed at Jane.  "...</itunes:summary>

Welcome to April! mdash;

March was a sad month worldwide, and I, frankly, am looking forward to leaving winter behind. (Yeah, I know March starts spring in the Northern Hemisphere, but the damp and dank weather wersquo;ve been having the US South makes me feel more like winter than January did.)

First, the world was shocked by the disasters in Japan, earthquake, tsunami, and the continuing threat of radiation from their nuclear plant.

Then fantasy lost one of its masters with the death of Diana Wynne Jones. Any fan or writer of fantasy needs to read her Tough Guide to Fantasyland, and, well, any of her other books. Thirdlyhellip;

Well, hell, isnrsquo;t that enough?

Many people find themselves feeling lost and useless when it comes to disasters, especially if theyrsquo;re happening far away. Luckily, some very quick and innovative SFF fans and professionals (including Pseudopodrsquo;s own Alasdair Stuart) got together to create Genre for Japan ( http://genreforjapan.wordpress.com/ ), an auction featuring signed books from authors, collections of books from publishers (like Tor and Angry Robot), and editing or critique services from agents and editors. All proceeds go to the Japan Tsunami Appeal run by the British Red Cross. (They know what theyrsquo;re doing.) Give generously and you can get some awesome prizes.

We hope yoursquo;re enjoying the monthly Soundproof PDFs.

We have had gotten a couple of questions asking why some of our audio stories donrsquo;t get printed on the site or in the Soundproof. The answer is simple: we donrsquo;t have the rights.

We buy the audio and ebook rights to all stories we are able to, but sometimes we are only able to get the audio rights, so those stories are in our audio feed. As we move forward we will do everything we can to get both ebook and audio rights.

Herersquo;s to a better month.

The rsquo;76 Goldwater Dime
By John Medaille

I started in 1962, thatrsquo;s when I became a numismatist. You know what that is? Itrsquo;s the study ofhellip;.well, itrsquo;s not the study of anything. Itrsquo;s coin collecting, is what it is.

I was ten in 1962, and Christmas I got my first coin album. I didnrsquo;t actually get it. My father gave it to my brother. It was, you know, yoursquo;ve seen them, a sturdy cardboard folder with slots punched out that you put the coins in. Behind the slots, the empties, it had a backing of blue felt, I remember that. My dad gave it to my brother, I guess maybe thinking it would straighten him out. But coins, you know, they donrsquo;t really have that power. He wasnrsquo;t interested. He gave it to me. Me, I was interested.

The album was for Lincoln pennies, 1909 to 1959. I had five cents in the world then and each of the five fit in the slot. It only took me five more days to get the other forty-five. I would do anything for those pennies and slot it in its slot. Anything, anything. When I got my last penny, wow. It was a 1943 steel mint penny, a lsquo;steelie.rsquo; They had to use steel instead of copper that year cause they needed the copper for all the bombs. I was so proud.

From then on it was just coins for me. My life was coins. I was hooked. They had their hooks in me, boy.

When I was just seventeen I moved by myself down to Washington, DC, cause I got a job there in a coin shop. That was my education. I lived in a one room dungeon in a crumby neighborhood, I loved coins that much.

You know, and I do alright. I made my living. I own my own house. I donrsquo;t live in debt like everybody else does. Thatrsquo;s what coins did for me. Coins and specie and spec. I donrsquo;t care for paper money, it holds nothing for me.

Me, Irsquo;m a specialist. I know generalists, I do business with them, I have to. And speculators, sure. You do what you need to do to survive in the world. But me, Irsquo;m a specialist and my friends are specialists. Irsquo;ll give an example, I have a friend, he died. But before he died, his specialty was pay toilet tokens. I mean, have you ever seen a pay toilet? In your life? I saw some once in Europe but I donrsquo;t even know if they have them there anymore. Anyway, this friend of mine, he spends his life collecting these tokens, these coins, for pay toilets, from around the world and every age. He finds the obscurest pay toilet tokens there are and theyrsquo;re his. And then he dies alone in his apartment with these thousands of toilet tokens around him. I mean, thatrsquo;s the way to go. I mean that. To have these objects of joy around you. To you and me, they are not objects of joy, but to him they are. You know, not everybody gets to have that, itrsquo;s not something that everyone receives. To have such pleasure from these things, these old things. But he does and I do because, see, wersquo;re specialists. Not everybody understands that.

Other people I know, you know, have their special collections. Any thing you can think of, any given thing and therersquo;s some guy like me out there obsessed with it. I know people, you meet a lot of interesting people in this business, whose specialties are Depression era wooden nickels or peep show tokens, or misprint coins, error coins, or brockage, thatrsquo;s coins with mirror image stamps on both sides, or obverses or lsquo;Godless Dollars.rsquo; You ever heard of lsquo;Godless Dollars?rsquo; Those are dollar coins where the ldquo;In God we trustrdquo; part got left off. Now, you see, I respect that. Those are people with specialties. They are connoisseurs, like me. Not any old crap will do.

Jaiden's Weaver
by Mary Robinette Kowal

I was never one of those girls who fell in love with horses. For one thing, on our part of New Oregon they were largely impractical animals. Most of the countryside consisted of forests attached to sheer hills and you wanted to ride something with a little more clinging ability. So from the time I was, well, from the time I can remember I wanted a teddy bear spider more than I wanted to breathe.

The problem is that teddy bear spiders were not cheap, especially not for a pioneer family trying to make a go of it.

Mom and Dad had moved us out of Landington in the first wave of expansion, to take advantage of the homesteading act. Our new place was way out on the eastern side of the Olson mountains where Dad had found this natural level patch about halfway up a forested ridge, so we got sunshine all year round, except for the weeks in spring and autumn when the shadow of our planet's rings passed over us. Our simple extruded concrete house had nothing going for it except a view of the valley, which faced due south to where the rings were like a giant arch in the sky. Even as a twelve-year-old, angry at being taken away from our livewalls in town to this dead structure, I fell in love with the wild beauty of the trees clinging to the sheer faces of the valley walls.

The only thing that would have made it better was a teddy bear spider so I could go exploring on my own. I felt trapped by the walls of the house and the valley. I had this dream that, if I had a spider, that I'd be able to sell its weavings for enough to install livewalls in my room. That's not as crazy as it sounds; teddy-bear spider weavings are collected all over the colonies and sell for insane amounts of money.

I had a search setup so anytime there was news of a teddy bear spider or a new tube surfaced, I'd be right there, watching those adorable long-legged beasts. I loved their plump furry faces and wanted to run my fingers through their silky russet fur.

I wonder what goes through a survey team's mind when they name things. I mean a teddy bear spider isn't a bear and it isn't a spider, but it looks like both those things. On the other hand, a fartycat looks nothing like a cat. They do stink, though.

Not quite a year after we'd moved, one of my city friends had forwarded an ad from a local board which set my heart to racing.

Teddy bear spider eggs: 75NOD shipped direct.

Read More...

See, I'd been looking at adult or adolescent teddies which cost more than my folks had set aside for me to go to university. It hadn't even occurred to me that I could raise one up myself. My mindless yearning changed into purpose.

I slapped that ad onto a piece of epaper and ran into the kitchen. "Dad! Mom! Look at this."

Dad glanced up from the eggs he was cracking into a bowl and pursed his lips the way he always did right before saying _no._ "Jaiden, that's a lot of money."

I waved the ad again as if it were a token to get me on a ride at the fair. "We'd make back the money when the teddy started to weave. Please? I've seen their weavings in stores for hundreds of NOD."
Mom ganged up on me. "That's how much the store sells a weaving for, it's not how much they pay for them. Even if it were, you're not just talking the cost of the eggs. It's the cost of feeding it, housing it, vet bills..."

I knew better than to keep arguing. Sometimes if I waited and tried again later, I could get them to change their minds. Still holding the ad, I went outside and plopped on the log bench Dad had made for the front of the house. The broad silver band of the ring spanned the sky, blocked by only a few clouds.</itunes:summary>

On a Clear Day You can See All the Way to Conspiracy
by Desmond Warzel

You're listening to the Mike Colavito Show on Cleveland's home for straight talk, WCUY 1200. The opinions expressed on this program do not reflect those of WCUY, its management, or its sponsors.

Fair warning; I'm in a mood today, folks.

We've got a mayor whose only talent seems to be showing up at luncheons and waving at the cameras.

Eighty bucks I had to pay yesterday for not wearing my seatbelt. Show me the seatbelts on a school bus.

I saw a Cleveland athlete on national TV last night wearing a Yankees cap.

And every day I get at least a dozen calls from schmucks who think that people like me are the problem in this city.

Tell me America's not falling apart.

[pause]

And some of you people--including our programming director, by the way--seem to think I'm running my mouth too much and not taking enough phone calls. I've only been number one in radio in this city for ten straight years; what would I know?

You want calls? You got 'em. Steven in Mayfield Heights, you're on the air.

"Hey, what's up, Mike?"

The rent. Art in Seven Hills, you're on WCUY.

"How you doing, Mike. Just wondering if you caught that ball game last night?"

No. Andrea in Rocky River, go ahead.

"Hi, Mike, first-time caller."

Well, call back tomorrow and you'll be a second-time caller. Carol in Cleveland, what's on your mind?

"Mike, what do you think of waterboarding?"

My wife and I waterboard all the time, and it's improved our sex life dramatically. Chuck in Parma, you're on the air.

"Hey, Mike, I heard your show yesterday, and I was just wondering, if you know so much about football, why you don't take over as head coach of the Browns?"

I wouldn't want to take the pay cut. Mina in Lakewood, you're on the air.

"Does your wife think that waterboarding crack was funny?"

Play your cards right some night and you could find out for yourself, Mina. Tommy in Beachwood, you're on WCUY.

"Hi, Mike, just wondering who you think the Indians should try and trade for next year."

Your mother. Jane in Euclid, go ahead.

[pause]

Read More...


Looks like we lost Jane in Euclid. Must have answered her question already. That's all right; we got in seven callers in under a minute. Everyone happy now? Hey, Jake, I have to take a breather; do the traffic.

What?

Oh, yeah. This traffic is brought to you by West Side Hardware.

Thanks, Mike. Not much happening right now; 480, 271, and 77 are all clear, but traffic on the Shoreway is backed up in both directions, so our listeners might want to allow a few extra minutes if they're headed that way. For West Side Hardware, this has been your WCUY traffic report on Cleveland's home for straight talk.

Hey, Jake, don't go yet. You still there? I gotta take the Shoreway home after the show. Any idea what the holdup is?

Can't say, Mike; no accidents, just a general slowdown all along the lakeshore.

Wonderful.

And people wonder why I'm always giving the mayor grief. Straightest stretch of highway in America, and traffic still won't move. Somebody on the Shoreway, call in and tell me what the hell's going on over there. Franklin in Cleveland, you're on the air.

"What's up, Mike? You gonna let me talk?"

Don't worry, it's all out of my system. The floor's yours.

"Well, you're entitled to your opinion about the mayor, but come on, man, how you gonna blame him for slow traffic?"

The traffic's just a symptom. I'm talking about neglect. Name me one thing the mayor's accomplished since he took office.

"Well--"

You can't, Franklin, beca</itunes:summary>

Grandfather Paradox
by Katherine Mankiller

JUNE 23, 1994

Ann stuffed her blood-spattered clothes into the next door apartment complex's dumpster.  He wasn't dead, but it was harder to get a knife through someone's chest than she'd expected.  Maybe he'd bleed to death before someone found him.  She didn't care either way.  She was a juvenile, so it wasn't like she was going to fry.

She walked.  The YMCA was open.  She locked herself in the men's room, curled up on the floor, and fell asleep.

The next morning, she stopped at an IHOP and told a grey-haired waitress, "I don't have any money, but can I have a cup of coffee?" The waitress must have felt sorry for her:  she bought her breakfast. Afterwards, she went to Safeway and hid a steak and a bottle of beer under her coat and walked out.  And kept walking.  Someone had a barbecue grill in their back yard.  She took it, and the charcoal, too.

What she could really go for now was some mushrooms.  She should swipe some Kool-Aid and find a cow pasture.  Or maybe she could rob a veterinary clinic.  Anything to get the thought of him touching her out of her head, and that beer wasn't going to cut it.

Steak and beer.  Almost luxurious.

The sign read "Open House."  Yes, that sounded about perfect.  She spent the night there, on the carpet smelling faintly of shampoo.

It had happened to him, too.  What her father had done to her, his father had done to him.  Which, in her opinion, just made it worse. He knew what it was like.

When the police arrived and told her she was under arrest for murder, she couldn't stop laughing.

JANUARY 4, 2014

The crane lifted the sealed concrete container out of the hole in the ground.  Ann lay down in the snow next to the hole and reached inside.  "My arms are too short," she said.

Martin lay down next to her.

"Excuse me?" Dr. Chandler, the president of the university, said.

"I'm sorry," Martin said.  "I thought my department chair had spoken to you.  Martin Robbins, physics.  My head programmer, Ann O'Connell. Please, continue."

Dr. Chandler gave them a dirty look, then walked over to the microphone.  "This time capsule was sealed in 1914.  The items inside represent what they wanted us to know about the past.  I'm sure our history department is hoping I'll cut the speech short and let them get at it..."

There was a chuckle from the crowd.

"Got it," Martin said.  He pulled out a grimy Tyvek envelope, and opened it.  Inside, there was a penny dated 2013.  Martin smiled at her.  "Looks like our own time capsule arrived intact."

FEBRUARY 9, 2014

"How are you feeling today, Ann?"  Dr. Katz asked.  Her glasses were perched precariously on her nose, and her bun was in danger of falling down.

Screw her.  "Is my hour up yet?"

"No."

Fine.  Be that way.

"How are things going with Martin?"

"I stopped dating Martin."

"Why?"

"Because he wanted to sleep with me.  It was awful.  Ugh."

Dr. Katz was giving Ann that psychiatrist look.  Well, Ann had felt like she had to.  Saying no would be rude.  Well, not rude, but... Anyway, no more Martin.  She'd had her phone number changed, and if he came around again?  Restraining order.  Work the system, or the system works you.

"How does that affect your job?" Dr. Katz asked.

"I have vacation time," Ann said.  "I took it."

Yoursquo;re Almost Here
by Melinda Thielbar
 
ldquo;Can I share your table?rdquo;

You look up to see your dream girl. Red hair, cream-colored skin, face just a little round, breasts just a little small. Not movie-star beautiful, not perfect just--nice. She smiles, and her cheeks dimple, and yoursquo;re in love. You gesture to the empty chair across from you with a grin of your own.

ldquo;Be my guest,rdquo; you say.

ldquo;Thanks.rdquo; She takes the chair and sets her coffee cup down. You close the notebook in front of you and open your mouth to say somethingmdash;anythingmdash;to impress this girl.
 
Without looking at you, she turns in her chair, pulls a phone out of her pocket and bends over it. You watch her face in profile as she slips a pair of earbuds into her ears. Your mouth is still open, so you close it and look away. Thatrsquo;s when you see that every table is occupied. Men in suits, women in suits, a few people your age in khakis or jeans. Theyrsquo;re all looking down at their phones, laptops, or handheld game consoles. Sunlight streams in through the floor-to-ceiling windows, and you watch people passing by on the street for a minute. Theyrsquo;re all looking straight ahead, faces set the way they have to be in a city this size. When itrsquo;s this crowded, the only privacy you can give a stranger is not to notice them. That idea interests you, and so you open your notebook to jot it down at the bottom of the second-to-last page. As yoursquo;re writing, a chair scrapes behind you, and a guy in a navy three-piece moves past. He flips his phone open and then closed again, checking the time, and hurries out.
 
The girl across from you moves almost as fast as he does. ldquo;Thanks,rdquo; she says and flashes that amazing smile again before she grabs her drink and hops to the newly-open table. You write FUCK across the top of the second-to-last page of your notebook, tuck it into your pocket, and go get another coffee.

The barristomatic (you call it this; no one else does), takes your thumbprint and opens a menu with your recent drink selections. Theyrsquo;re supposed to be sorted so the one you drink most is at the top. For you, it might as well be random. You do something different every time. This onersquo;s a half-pump vanilla, half-pump strawberry, soy milk latte with a lousy espresso bean that still costs more than all the other ingredients put together because itrsquo;s fair-trade and organic. You once enumerated every combination, ranked them from most to least expensive an...</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Quick note: Sorry it's late folks, minor illness-related delays.

The ePub version can be foundnbsp;here.

To our readersmdash;

Irsquo;ve always been of two minds about that proverb (well, curse) that has been attributed to the ancient Chi- nese of ldquo;May you live in interesting times.rdquo;

Because letrsquo;s face it, boring times are getting further apart and fewer. The era of the noble farmer living a quiet life on the plains is long dead in much of the developed world, and while we always dream of re- turning home to a quiet Ithaca, I think a lot of us prefer the torrents of the seas and not knowing what the next isle will bring.

Which is bit of a long way of saying that it was a bit of a crazy month last month, wasnrsquo;t it?

Thousands of much better words than these have been etched in the cyber on the wave of popular revolu- tions in North Africa and the Middle East, so Irsquo;m going talk about the impending end of the Space Shuttle program.

Space shuttles were always a bit of science fiction that existed in the real world for those of us who grew up after the space race. They were the oddly shaped white space ships in the toy box with the X and Y- Wings and variants of the Enterprise.

They mixed the aspiration of escape from the bonds of gravity with the weight of tragedy that such aspira- tion can lead to. They were something between a pickup truck and the first real wave of space colonizers. Not that the two are mutually exclusive

The third to last shuttle mission is skimming the stratosphere as I write this, and the last one is due to launch in June. And then the US civilian space program will be reliant on private sector for space vehicles until at least 2015. Which, in a way, is progress.

But progress that doesnrsquo;t quite sit right. You want commercial haulers out there making space civilized, useful, and cheap enough that you might be able to hop out there for less than a decadersquo;s salary. But therersquo;s a need for ships of the line, and those come from the public masses.

Last month, Escape Pod brought you four stories, two of which will be republished here. Unfortunately we bought EP279: Conditional Love just before we started asking for ePub rights, as it was just nominated for the Nebula. Escape Pod knows all, but not always at the right time.

But we are bringing you the excellent David D. Levinersquo;s Written On The Wind and the quite interesting Alex Dally MacFarlanersquo;s The Notebook of My Favorite Skin-Trees. Onersquo;s about a bunch of aliens living together, mostly in peace, and the otherrsquo;s about advertising in the near future.

We also did something a little special with the Written On The Wind episode, and you can read about it in the back of this monthrsquo;s Soundproof.
Yours,
mdash;Bill</itunes:summary>

The Notebook of my Favourite Skin-Trees
By Alex Dally MacFarlane

BANANA

The best part of these are the fruits, growing on their fat stem, dangling down the personrsquo;s back or from their arm. I always bow and smile, asking, ldquo;Can I taste one of your fruits? Bananas from a skin-tree are so sweet.rdquo;

So sweet and so small, a single mouthful.

I also enjoy the place where banana tree meets flesh, roots curving over and into the personrsquo;s limb -- pressing my lips there, my tongue -- and the small shade cast by the leaves.

#

Kim Cuc saw advertisements everywhere she looked in the walking street market, but only on the leaves of the skin-trees: names of shops and cafeacute;s and restaurants spelled out, Thai or English or other languages, in the bright white veins. Aside from the occasional cry from stall owners or vendors -- ldquo;I have the finest grilled bananas in Chiang Mai! Come and taste!rdquo; -- no other form of promotion cluttered the senses.

That had always been the intent of the skin-treesrsquo; engineers and earliest supporters. Kim Cuc smiled often, seeing the remains of once-garishly lit billboards, or walls that several years earlier would have been covered in paper.

No smiles on this night.

She stopped every person with a skin-tree in the walking street market, to ask if theyrsquo;d noticed strange discolourations on their leaves. ldquo;There is a sickness,rdquo; she said, putting urgency into the phrase she now knew in many languages, not just her native Vietnamese and second tongue English, ldquo;and itrsquo;s important to collect samples and data.rdquo; Into one of the notebooks carried under her arm, she noted the age and ethnicity of the person, the age and species of their tree, the company its leaves advertised -- this for those whose trees remained healthy. In a second notebook, with frowning lizards on the spine, she noted the same information for those whose trees were not. There she added information about the duration of the discolourations, their colour and spread. Samples went into a third notebook, with little clips to fasten two pages together, and special paper to protect and preserve the leaves.

The lizard-spined notebook was not as full as the first, yet.

Late in the night, when vendors began packing away their wares, Kim Cuc followed the shoppers returning to their homes. She drank from the large bottle of nutrient-full water she always carried around. The durian tree growing on her left shoulder needed it.

She passed a stall selling Buddha-shaped lanterns, a popular tourist item. Some still glowed, yellowly and redly, and in their light she glanced at her durian. A brown circle, no greater in circumference than a joss stick, lay on the edge of one leaf.

ldquo;No!rdquo; she cried out.

The bright screen of her wrist-computer did not contradict the Buddha lights.

#

BANYAN

The banyanrsquo;s thick roots suggest a secret fluidity, like wax, uncommon to plants: frozen over Pitsamairsquo;s shoulder, beginning where bone used to jut from her thin flesh, sliding down her shoulder blades, curling around her upper arm (carefully trained not to restrict movement), stretching across her collarbone and down her breastbone, down the neat lines of her ribs. They frame her right breast. I always think they will flow when Pitsamai is alone, even though she tells me this isnrsquo;t the case.

The thick leaves advertise Chiang Mai University. Veins curl in the letters in Thai and English, artificially white against dark green. Pitsamai loves her university.

The tangled trunks rise from her shoulder, a...</itunes:summary>

ldquo;Do you know what day it is? What year?rdquo;

ldquo;Itrsquo;s like mid August, 2017?rdquo; her voice squeaked. Jesus, had she really lost her mind?

ldquo;Thatrsquo;s right.rdquo; She smiled. ldquo;Donrsquo;t be scared. I just wanted to be sure.rdquo;

ldquo;What do you mean donrsquo;t be scared?rdquo; she blurted. ldquo;Sure about what? Jesus! How long have I been here? How many times have you seen me before?rdquo;

Jani held up her hand. ldquo;Slow down; itrsquo;s okay...Irsquo;m not an oncologist, but Irsquo;m following your case. The cancer responded well to the treatment. And our research suggests that the side effects are temporary.rdquo;

Stephanie started to protest but then stopped. A terrifying memory flashed through her mind. ldquo;Mom said they might take me to a hospital for the dead.rdquo; She didnrsquo;t know what that meant but the memory was clear. ldquo;She said yoursquo;d keep me here to fool me into thinking Irsquo;m still alive.rdquo;

Jani was holding up both hands now. ldquo;Slow down. The survival rates are scary but theyrsquo;re far bettermdash;rdquo;

ldquo;Yoursquo;re not listening. She said theyrsquo;d take me to a hospital for people whorsquo;ve _already_ died. I have to escape beforemdash;rdquo;

Stephanie started to stand but Jani put a heavy hand on her shoulder and said ldquo;Lullaby.rdquo;

The word opened a bloom of orange light across Stephaniersquo;s vision. A static hiss exploded into her ears, and she felt herself falling. There was a firecracker yellow flash and then...nothing.</itunes:summary>

The new patient was five or six years old, male, Caucasian, John Doe as  usual.nbsp; Grace checked the vitals his bed sensors were feeding her board  and concluded he was asleep.nbsp; She eased the door of 408 open and stepped in.

The boyrsquo;s head was tilted on his pillow, brown curls cluttering his  forehead.nbsp; Sleep had flushed his cheeks so he looked younger than the  estimate.nbsp; He seemed healthy, with no visible deformities, and if he had  been opted for looks, it had workedmdash;Grace would have described him as  lsquo;cherubicrsquo;.nbsp; He wouldnrsquo;t have been dumped if nothing was wrong, so Grace  found herself stepping softly, unwilling to disturb him and discover  psychological conditions.  

ldquo;Donrsquo;t worry about waking him, he sleeps pretty deep.rdquo;  

Grace started and turned to the other bed.nbsp; ldquo;Hi, Minnie.rdquo;  

The girl grimaced.nbsp; ldquo;I go by my full name now, Dr. Steller.rdquo;nbsp; Grace  brought up her board to refresh her memory, but the girl said, ldquo;Minerva.  nbsp;Had you forgotten theyrsquo;re doubling up rooms?rdquo;  

ldquo;Yep, you caught me.rdquo;  

ldquo;Is the rise in numbers caused by a rise in opting?nbsp; Or is it a rise in  surrenders, or arrests of parents?rdquo;  

ldquo;Lord, Minnmdash;Minerva, I donrsquo;t know.nbsp; Planning to be a reporter when you  grow up?rdquo;  

ldquo;No, a scientist,rdquo; Minerva said and smiled, pleased to be asked.  

ldquo;Why the scalpel-edged questions then?rdquo;  

ldquo;Just curious if my campaign had had any effect,rdquo; Minerva said, nodding  toward the window.nbsp; The billboard across from the Gene-Engineered  Pediatric Inpatient Center flashed a smog warning, then a PSA about eye  strain from computer visors, but Grace remembered when it had borne a  static image:nbsp; Minnie, one year old, a pink sundress exposing the stubs  of her arms and legs.nbsp; _Babies should be born, not made._nbsp; The ad had  stayed up until Minnie was eight, three years after her parents turned  her over to GEPIC, and apparently she had seen it.nbsp; She was twelve now,  with serious eyes and a loose ponytail, dark blonde. </itunes:summary>

Written on the Wind
by David D. Levine

Thuren Nektopk peered down at Luulianni from above his massive desk.  "I suspect you know why I've called you to speak with me in person."  He spoke in his native language, Ptopku Dominant, using the form of address for a subordinate or a child.  It was a constant reminder that the Ptopku had built and largely staffed this station, and was one of the most powerful species in the Consortium.

"Yes, Supervisor," Luulianni replied in the same language, knotting her tentacles.  

"And that would be...?"

"Because of my side project."

"Yes."  Nektopk suddenly released the bar from which he hung, caught himself on another handhold, and with two swift strokes of his arms swung down to where his six slitted eyes were level with Luulianni's.  "Your little side project."  

Luulianni cringed.  "I don't understand why it's so much of a problem."  She straightened and tried to meet his gaze.  "I put in my full quota of time every day."

"Yes, you do, and not one moment more.  But I know you are capable of so much more than that.  Any work you do on this pointless little side project of yours constitutes theft of resources from the Section -- from the whole Project!"

"Theft?" she squeaked.  Angry at herself for the loss of control, she brought her voice down.  "Theft of resources?  But I don't use any data storage space, or any other Section resources!  I write my notes on the backs of old printouts."  She did not mention how much more natural it felt to work on paper.

"You are stealing the most valuable resource of all!"  Nektopk pointed at her with one limber foot.  "Your own time and attention!"

"But it's my time!"

"You have been sent here by your people -- at considerable expense, I might add -- to assist in the Project, to learn the ways of the Consortium, and to demonstrate your species' unique skills."  He leaned closer to her.  His smell was bitter.  "And if I find that your species, as represented by yourself, does not demonstrate any unique skills, your application for Consortium membership could very well be denied."  He swung himself up to the edge of his desk, the better to glare down at her.  "Therefore, your time is not your own.  You owe it to the Section, to the Project, and to your own people to put every bit of available time into your assigned task."

Luulianni hung her head.  "Yes, Supervisor."

"You may return to your work."

"Thank you, Supervisor."

Luulianni's scales prickled with anger as she made her way back to her workspace.  If she was to demonstrate her unique skills, why did he not listen to her ideas?  And if her time was so valuable, why did Nektopk insist that she come to his office, halfway across the station, rather than using the screen?  

She straightened her shoulders and forced herself to walk down the middle of the corridor.  The Muuli were a burrowing species; her instinct was to cling to the wall, to hide from the harsh, bluish light and the Ptopku swinging from handhold to handhold far above.  Luulianni consoled herself that some day her people would build their own stations in space, with low ceilings and narrow corridors.  They would be dark, and warm, and smell of dirt and of many long-nosed Muuli.

But that day was a long time away.  And if she didn't prove herself here, it might never come.

She knew she was one of the best linguists of her species.  Her work had been invaluable in establishing communication with the many races of the Consortium when they had arrived on her world.  Jun Dal-Nieri, the highly respected head of the Contact Team, had insisted she join the Eight Degrees Projec</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>To our lovely readersmdash;

Itrsquo;s awards season, and yes, we will be talking about it on the blog, and in future podcasts. Even as SF authors all over are posting on their blogs about their 2010 award-eligible work, others are discussing whether this is blatantly trolling for votes.

I can see how a constant barrage of VOTE FOR ME OMG could be irritating and tacky. I certainly find it so when itrsquo;s podcast award season, and one award allows listeners to vote daily, so the constant vote requests tend to be cacophonous. However, Irsquo;m spreading out the awards information for one main reason: donrsquo;t forget the podcasts.

Until recently, people didnrsquo;t even think about nominating a podcast (or any web content) for a Hugo. Heck, it was ground-breaking when webzines started to win. But last year, Catherine Valente self-published a book on her site, and it went on to win the Andre Norton award for best YA novel. Clarkesworld, an online magazine, won the Hugo for best semi-pro zine. And as wersquo;ve mentioned several times (because itrsquo;s still SO FREAKING COOL) Starship Sofa won the Hugo for best fanzine.

I had an uncomfortable panel discussion at last yearrsquo;s NASFiC (North American Science Fiction Convention). We had a panel on podcasting and a very bitter fanzine author showed up (Irsquo;d politely say they shall remain nameless, but honestly I never did catch their name), This person expressed anger that these new methods of reaching fans were getting all their friends to vote for them, as if new fans, or listeners to SF instead of readers, were less worthy to vote for the Hugos.

What gets me is that the new is considered unworthy, not paying its dues, and the fans are similarly unworthy, and their votes just donrsquo;t mean as much. I find that incredibly offensive, as our fans are worldwide, and many have been dedicated to us since we launched five years ago. Others are new to the genre, just trying it out, and loving it, and I sure as hell donrsquo;t want to take a new fan of the genre and tell them they arenrsquo;t worthy.

You, the readers and listeners, donrsquo;t give a crap about this infighting in SF. You want a good story. We try to deliver it to you. As does LightSpeed and Clarkesworld and Starship Sofa and Pseudopod and Podcastle and Drabblecast and Asimovrsquo;s and Analog and F#38;SF and Weird Tales... and so on. You want SF content. We give it to you. And thatrsquo;s the end of story. (Until next week, anyway.)

I had not planned on going on such an impassioned rant. I just want to say that a new fan is worth just as much as an old fan, and a new way to experience shot stories is not a reason to discount it. And whether the Internet-wary veterans like it or not, if yoursquo;re eligible to vote for these awards (WorldCon member for Hugos, SFWA member for Nebulas, and HWA member for Stokers) then your vote counts just as much as theirs does.

I wanted to use this letter to remind you that many, many podcasts are now eligible for the major awards. Starship Sofa broke it open last year, and now we just need to let the listeners know. When you make your Hugo or Nebula or World Fantasy or Stoker ballots, consider Escape Pod, Pseudopod, and Podcastle. Donrsquo;t forget Starship Sofa and Drabblecast. Remember also your favorite podcast novels, novellas, and short stories that were released last year. Irsquo;m not telling you who to vote for, in any of the categories, just wanting to remind you that we mdash; the online content providers mdash; are here are here, delivering weekly content, and if you enjoy it, consider us when you make your nominations.

Yours,

mdash;Mur

Rejiggering the Thingamajig
by Eric James Stone

The teleport terminal had not been built with tyrannosaurus sapiens in mind.

Resisting the urge to knock human-sized chairs about with her tail, Bokeerk squatted on the tile floor, folded the claws of her forelimbs together, and concentrated on her breathing.  Meditation would calm her nerves.  What should have been a two-minute waystop as she switched to a different teleport line had stretched to three hours, and being the only passenger in the terminal creeped her out.

The cheerful voice of the customer service AI roused Bokeerk from her trance.  "It is my pleasure to inform you that the cause of the technical difficulties in the galactic teleport network has been found."

Bokeerk perked up and rose on her hind legs, remembering just in time to duck her head so it wouldn't bang the ceiling lamps.  "Please send me to Krawlak," she said.  It was unlikely that any of her eggs would hatch for another few days yet, but she was anxious to get home.

"It is with the utmost regret that I must tell you that will not be possible at this time," said the AI, with a tone of such abysmal sorrow that Bokeerk's eyes could not help but moisten with sympathetic tears.  "I require assistance in repairing the problem."

Bokeerk lowered herself into a squat again.  "When will help get here?"  She looked at the time display on the digital assistant strapped to her left forelimb.  She had now been stranded for three hours and fifty-two minutes.

"I estimate a spaceship carrying a repair crew could be here within twelve years," said the AI.  Its voice seemed to have lost the customer service aspect.

"Twelve years?"  Bokeerk's voice made the ceiling lamps tremble.

"Without the teleport network, repair crews are limited to slower-than-light travel.  However, I believe we can avoid such a long wait if you will assist me."

"I don't know anything about repairing teleports," said Bokeerk.  "Iillustrate children's books.  I'm on my way home from the Galactic Children's Book Fair."

"You do not need to repair anything," said the AI.  "You merely need to obtain the . . . there's no word for it in English because it is a concept so far beyond the understanding of biological intelligences that there has never been a need for one until now.  Let's call it the thingamajig.  Once you have the thingamajig, you need to do something to it that is completely incomprehensible to your puny mind."

"Hey," said Bokeerk.  She had encountered this kind of prejudice too often.  "My brain may be as small as that of an original tyrannosaurus, but it's the product of genetic tinkering such that my intelligence is at least human standard."

"No slur was intended.  By my standards, any biological intelligence is puny."

"So I just need to do something incomprehensible to the thingamajig, and the teleport network will be fixed?"

"Yes."

"Show me where it is," Bokeerk said.

A holographic projection of a world appeared.  It zoomed in toward a green area on one of the continents until it showed a gray dome in the middle of a jungle.  "This is the teleport station where you are currently located," said the AI.

The image zoomed out until the dome was merely a gray dot.  A crimson line traced a route toward a lone mountain, where it stopped with a large dot.  "You must travel to the top of this extinct volcano, where you will find the thingamajig."

"How far is that?" asked Bokeerk.

"Forty-four miles."

"You don't have a vehicle that would fit me, do you?"

"There are no vehicles of any size."

Bokeerk rose.  "I guess I'd better get started."

"You'll need a gun...</itunes:summary>

On a Blade of Grass

"Interstellar war is about as exciting as playing chess by mail." The guy who said that had been leaning into the bar for so long I thought his chest might fuse with the wood. I drifted over, because he wasn't a regular, and I was bored with all my regulars and their regular bullshit.

"Who plays chess by mail anymore?" I said. "With the 'net and all."

"Nobody. Guys in jail maybe, I don't know. Because it's boring. My point. Inefficient and slow. Just like this war." He tapped his glass meaningfully. He was rumpled and sleep-creased and middle-aged and smelly, but a better class of smelly than my usual crowd -- like working-all-night-sweaty smelly, not sitting-around-all-day smelly. Long enough tending bar and you can tell the difference.

I refilled his glass. He was a pretty good drinker, but the little guys often are. "They say by the time our warships get out there, to their homeworld, the Phages might even be extinct. Like, just from natural processes, long timescales, like that. Or they might've evolved into something new, something that doesn't... you know..."

"Want to eat us?"

The guy shook his head. "The aliens don't want to eat us. That was my, what do you call it. Epiphany. They don't want to eat us any more than we want to explore brave new frontiers. All that, eating and exploring, it's just, it's just  incidental."

"I'm pretty sure they want to eat us. Being as, the first time we encountered them, they ate us." I polished a glass, not because the glass was dirty -- it's self-cleaning nanoglass, I run a quality establishment -- but because it's traditional and makes the customers feel like the world isn't rushing past them at a billion miles per second. Well. Metaphorically. Nothing moves that fast, because it's faster than the speed of light, and if things could move faster than the speed of light, this interstellar war would be a lot less boring. At least me and any descendants I was likely to know personally would be dead long before any counterattack hit Earth.

"You know much about parasites?" the guy said.

"Eh. When my wife was pregnant, she made me scoop the shit out of the cat boxes, so she wouldn't get, what do you call it, toxoplasmosis. That's a parasite, right?" I mused. "You know, I'm still the one scooping the cat boxes, and our kid's six years old now. I keep saying we should get nanolitter, but that one cat in Germany got dissolved when the stuff malfunctioned, my wife says she won't risk it."

The guy frowned, like my cat shit stuff had derailed him, but he leaned in deeper and poked the bar with his finger. "Toxoplasmosis. Good example. Yeah, dangerous for women if they get their first exposure when they're pregnant, it can hurt the baby, right, but fact is your wife probably already has it. A third of the people on this planet have the parasite already. Hell, in France, it's close to ninety percent. Not so many here."

"No shit?" I said.

"And, see, the parasite doesn't just make you sick. Toxoplasmosis, a lot of times, you don't get sick at all. But it changes you. Women infected with it, when they have babies, they have more boys than girls. No one knows why. The parasites can change your behavior, too, they make cysts in your brain, alter your personality. They make men more promiscuous and less jealous. They make people less, how do they say it, 'novelty seeking.' Men think women infected with toxoplasmosis are more attractive. Infected women are definitely nicer, anyhow."

"My wife is hot," I said. "I don't think it's because she's got cysts in he</itunes:summary>

Schrouml;dinger's Cat Lady
By Marjorie James

I got out of the car, smoothed my shirt down over my bulletproof vest, and contemplated the cats. They contemplated me right back. I sighed. I hated these jobs.

I opened the tiny gate to the front walk (no fence, just a gate) and made my way to the door. The house was small and tidy, a light blue bungalow with green trim and yellow curtains pulled across the windows, through which the cats were peering. It didnrsquo;t smell, which was a relief. And something of a surprise, considering the heat. It was one of those days when the world seemed to be actively rejecting human habitation, where the smog and the humidity made the air feel like warm mayonnaise. On a day like this, a cat overpopulation should be stinking to high heaven. Maybe this wasnrsquo;t for real, I hoped. It might just be some neighbor with a grudge. Couldnrsquo;t be more than a dozen cats here, max. Maybe this one wasnrsquo;t going to be that bad.

I have never been very good at predicting things.

I knocked, and waited. A few minutes later there was the sound of multiple locks being unfastened, then some more, then an abortive attempt to open the door, then one last, forgotten bolt sliding back.

The door opened and I was confronted by the smallest person I had ever met. The woman wouldnrsquo;t have cleared five feet without some impressive shoes and a generous hand with the measuring tape and her hands and face (the only parts of her that were visible from under the intricate layers of scarves and sweaters) were narrow and delicate. She looked up at me with what seemed to be genuine pleasure.

ldquo;Yes? How can I help you?rdquo;

ldquo;Good morning, marsquo;am. Irsquo;m Lieutenant Eleanor Ross from Animal Welfare. Can I talk with you for a moment?rdquo;

Sweat was pouring off me and pooling where my bulletproof vest squeezed against my back. I tried to subtly adjust the vest and the sweat streamed down my butt. I grimaced, and the woman noticed.

She smiled. ldquo;Are you afraid Irsquo;m going to shoot at you?rdquo;

I smiled back. ldquo;Department policy. Everyone has to wear them, at all times.rdquo;

ldquo;I think thatrsquo;s wise. After all, you never know. I might have shot at you. Would you like to come in?rdquo;

I thanked her and followed her into the house. It was a modest bungalow, indistinguishable from every other house on the block, aside from the paint job and the total lack of flowers in the yard. Which is why the interior came as something of a surprise.

The door led to an ordinary entrywaymdash;a pair of wooden clogs on the tiled floor, a small table scattered with junk mail. But just beyond that the room opened up into something I could best describe as the bastard child of a hunting lodge and a picture I had seen once of an artistrsquo;s rendition of a Roman baths, only without the naked people.

There were no people at all, in fact, aside from myself and the woman, but there was a very large quantity of cats. They were everywhere, pouring out of alcoves and off of furnituremdash;some even seemed to come straight out of the wallsmdash;and there seemed to be plenty of space for all of them. In fact, there was more than enough space, far more than was possible, given the apparent dimensions of the house.

It occurred to me that I might be suffering from heatstroke.

ldquo;Irsquo;m sorry to bother you Mrs. . . .rdquo; I looked down at my notes, which were nothing but an illegible scribble.

ldquo;Oh, call me Mrs. S. Everyone does. And itrsquo;s no bother, no bother at all. I get so few guests these days, and it does get lonely, yo...</itunes:summary>

ldquo;Not one of the Big Three?  Thought CocaCorp would want a piece of that.rdquo;

 Rutter had wondered that himself.  By all accounts, Solin was a plum piece of real estate, the kind one of the big companies like General M or Bushink would snatch up as an asset.  Across the galaxies, theyrsquo;d grabbed small systems every chance they got.  Solin did have a native intelligent race tp be wooed, but there was a surplus of impoverished races deep in debt to the Companies.  Very few, the ones who knew to hire themselves savvy (and expensive) legal counsel, managed to keep themselves free.

 There was, Rutter figured, something out of the ordinary about Solin.  Not out of the ordinary in a valuable way, but something tricky, something slippery or scandalous, some taint the Big Three wanted to avoid.  Hersquo;d find out soon enough, he guessed.

		<itunes:summary>Mur kindly introduced me in the last issue of Soundproof, but for anyone who missed that, hi. Irsquo;m Escape Podrsquo;s Assistant Editor, and Irsquo;m most publicly known for doing the feedback segments in the podcast. I also oversee our teem of slush readers and end up sending out a lot of our rejections, and of course I lay out Soundproof. And other things, as necessary.

So in this beginning of a new year, Irsquo;m instead going to take you back a few days to the death of the last machine on earth that could turn a roll of Kodachrome from an opaque deep red film stock into color etched rectangles of plastic. Most of us have moved onto digital, which, letrsquo;s be fair, is significantly more user friendly and easier to control. Cheaper, too.

But it says something about Kodachrome mdash;nbsp;the first successful color filmnbsp;mdash; that it took 75 years to be phased out of production. Sure, it had dwindled in years past, and films meant for paper prints rather than to be projected got rapidly popular, and it was a finicky, and slow, film to shoot.

Getting it developed in the last decade or so meant sending it to one place in Kansas and always worrying that the machine would break or Kodak would stop making the developing chemistry. While itrsquo;s trivial to develop black and white film at home, and not too horrible to do most modern color films, Kodachromersquo;s process would confound most any man.

But it was pretty. Someone wrote a bit too saccharine song about it. And it picked up the light in a bit different way than everything after it.

So this month wersquo;re bringing you three stories in this pixelated form: Eacute;lan Vital by K. Tempest Bradford, Deadrsquo;s End to Middleton by Natania Barron, and God of the Lower Level by Charles M. Saplak.

Theyrsquo;re quite good.

Dead's End to Middleton
By Natania Barron

Dust rose at the horizon in tongues of earth and wind, dancing before  the sinking sun. Bits of mica flashed now and again; almost like fairy  dust, thought Nathaniel, more than a little delirious in his saddle by  now. It had been far too hot for a breakneck race such as this.

But there were slobbering, chittering creatures swarming Middleton  behind him, slavering over the horses and terrorizing the families that  made up his close-knit community. Their only hope was in him. Sutherland  Ranch couldnrsquo;t be far. Old Man Sutherland would know what to do.

Time was wasting. His horse, Mixup, needed water, and Nathaniel  needed rest. His tongue felt cold, his lips cracked and bleeding; hersquo;d  gone so far past dizzy that hersquo;d come to expect the world to shift a bit  by now.

But, no. Maybe not that much.

Read More--

ldquo;Donrsquo;t move.rdquo;

A voice. A woman.

It  was easy enough to comply. Nathaniel doubted he had the strength to  move, anyway; his ankle was still twisted up in the stirrup.

So hersquo;d fainted at some point. If hersquo;d had strength in his arms,  hersquo;d have held them up, but Nathaniel wasnrsquo;t certain what the logistics  of surrender were when belly-up to the sky.

ldquo;Hersquo;s hurt,rdquo; said a second voice. Another woman, but high and lovely in contrast.

Squinting, Nathaniel made out two figures against the pink clouds:  big hats, skirts, trim waists, and very long guns. Guns pointed at him.

ldquo;Irsquo;m looking forhellip; Willard Sutherlandhellip; Irsquo;m from Middleton. Wersquo;ve beenhellip;rdquo; he barely managed the words.

The shorter of the two women tilted her head. She got close enough  that Nathaniel could hear the flapping of her skirts in the wind. He had  a dim recollection of Charity James being dragged off down the alleyway  between the saloon and the stables, one shoe off as she struggled and  screamed; he could see up her skirt then, all the way to her bloomers.  Thenhellip; Christ. She hadnrsquo;t screamed for long.

ldquo;Willard Sutherlandrsquo;s dead,rdquo; said the first woman. Nathaniel tried  to get a better look at her. Curly red hair, narrow eyes, a flat nose,  big boots.

ldquo;Then, his sons? Edwin and Edwardhellip;rdquo; Nathaniel tried.

ldquo;Dead, too.rdquo;

ldquo;Jesus, no.rdquo; Blasphemy was the least of his worries.

ldquo;Afraid  so,rdquo; said the soft-voiced woman. Nathaniel could see the outline of her  slippers by his head. Pretty slippers. Expensive slippers. What  slippers like that were doing out here in the middle of nowhere, he  didnrsquo;t know.

ldquo;Cassandra. Hush,rdquo; said the first woman, putting down her gun and taking a few heavy-footed steps toward him.

Cassandra  stepped away to let the other woman by, and Nathaniel shivered. Hersquo;d  found a grain of comfort in the sweetness of Cassandrarsquo;s voice, but now  that she was gone the severity of the other womanrsquo;s words were more  clear in his head. His hope was as dead as Charity James.

ldquo;Then you might as well let me die here,rdquo; he said, closing his eyes.

ldquo;The Sutherlands arenrsquo;t all dead,rdquo; said the first woman. ldquo;But you will be soon if you donrsquo;t get some water and shelter.rdquo;

ldquo;You need a bath. Yoursquo;re covered in, well, some rather offensive smelling ichor,rdquo; Cassandra said.

That was about right. The creatures had a habit of exploding rather impressively when, and if, they could be killed.

ldquo;Then perhaps we can talk business,rdquo; she added.

He licked his lips. ldquo...</itunes:summary>

Today was a perfect day, with three flaws.nbsp; It was snowing here in Miami, one of her brides had trouble recognizing her, and her cummerbund wouldn't stay up.nbsp; The cummerbund was the only problem Mel could fix.nbsp; She brushed ashes off the church office's desk and rummaged around for safety pins. She found typed notes for an old sermon, some yellow pushpins, and three tampons.nbsp; Mel took the tampons and left the rest.nbsp; Not a single safety pin, which surprised her--for a place that looters hadn't been through, there was little here.nbsp; Underneath the desk, Mel found a paperclip.nbsp; After a moment's thought, she opened her pocketknife and cut two holes in the cummerbund's back.nbsp; She unbent the paperclip, wired the cummerbund together, and attached it to the belt loop on her black jeans.

Her bridesmaid poked his head in.nbsp; "How're you doing in here?"

Paul had a fake poinsettia flower wedged behind his ear.nbsp; Mel laughed, a tense noise that hurt her throat.nbsp; "Paul, where did you get that flower?"

He grinned and walked into the office.nbsp; Paul had been a small-town Georgia fireman, in sunnier days.nbsp; He wore a plain gray shirt that exposed his well-muscled arms and new blue jeans that fit well.nbsp; Mel wondered where he'd found them.nbsp; Paul said, "I look like a hippie, don't I?nbsp; Well, a hippie on steroids.nbsp; You look sort of James Dean meets Roy Orbison.nbsp; I like the bow tie."

"I told you--you didn't have to get girly.nbsp; You can be my best man."</itunes:summary>

It is important for me to know how various organisms on Earth have solved the problems of moving, eating, seeing, and so on in order to build plausible aliens (or modifications for human beings).

		<description><![CDATA[Every now and then, a sci-fi or fantasy novel or series comes along that completely redefines your definition of &#8220;the best sci-fi book I&#8217;ve read&#8221;. Which is not to say it&#8217;s the best book ever, or that everyone who reads it will love it. However, in the case of author Sean McMullen&#8217;s Souls in the [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Habitation of the Blessed, being the first volume of A Dirge for Prester John, is the newest addition to the long and honorable tradition of fan fiction dedicated to a 12th-century forgery.
