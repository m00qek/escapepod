		<description><![CDATA[Have you written a story about The Timely Issue Of The Day? Will it still be timely by the time it's published? A writer can only hope.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About two years ago, I was flying with my family and I noticed that, when we landed, all I could hear was the sound of everyone’s cell phone booting up.</p>
<p>A month later, I had a 9000-word short-story about airport security. Taking place about 50 years in the future, it’s about a man traveling to Los Angeles to see his daughter and the rigmarole he has to go through.</p>
<p>It has yet to sell. I’ve cut down the word count, I’ve revised several times, I’ve sent it to a couple dozen publications… and no dice. No one seems to want it. (It almost made it to the top at <em>Andromeda Spaceways</em>, and the readers gave me good feedback, but they didn’t publish it.) I’m pretty sure it’s not getting bought because nothing actually <em>happens</em> &#8212; a man flies to Los Angeles to see his daughter – and editors I guess want stories where there’s action.</p>
<p>But that’s neither here nor there. Not at the moment.</p>
<p>Last Monday, as I sat at my desk at work watching post after post about <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater”">security theater</a> pass by on Tweetdeck, I felt a little spark of hope that my story might soon find a home.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it often takes months for stories to get from the slush pile to the editorial desk.</p>
<p>I understand that. I really do. And I’m very patient – I follow the submission guidelines to the best of my ability, I never bother editors unless the official response time has passed by more than a full week, and I don’t complain about form rejections. The reality of writing is that there’s a metric buttload of us and a relatively small number of editors and markets.</p>
<p>Still, now that I’ve exhausted most of the long-story markets, it’s going to be harder for me to find a home for my story. I predict a long couple of nights of rewriting, followed by sending out the story… and waiting.</p>
<p>And waiting.</p>
<p>And waiting.</p>
<p>Just like every other burgeoning author.</p>
<p>Thing is, by the time my story gets to the top of the slush pile, the timeliness of it will probably be moot. All this hullabaloo about scanners that <a href="//boingboing.net/2010/01/22/naked-airport-scanne.html”">don’t detect bombs in body cavities</a>, <a href="//gizmodo.com/5689759/tsa-full+body-scanners-protecting-passengers-or-padding-pockets”">scanners that show screeners your naked body</a>, <a href="//lifehacker.com/5690402/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-tsa-screenings-and-gropings”">fines being levied against people who refuse to be body-scanned</a> and don’t want your hands on their junk… it’ll all be over in three, six, nine, or 12 months (or whenever the story eventually is read by an editor who wants it). Then it’ll be another three to 18 months until it actually sees print. At that point, we’ll have moved onto another cause celebre. Twitter will be complaining about the next Apple tablet that doesn’t do That One Thing Everyone Likes, or a politician who said That One Thing Everyone Thought Was Idiotic, or the fact that people without That One Smartphone are technological luddites who don’t deserve to pray at the altars of their mighty cellphone providers.</p>
<p>I’m okay with that. I really am. But it makes me wonder if I should mention in my cover letter that I wrote the story in response to airline security woes. Usually my cover letters are very simple: here is my story, I hope you like it and choose to publish it, thank you. (Soon they will include the location of my first professional publication, but until I have a contract in hand I’m not revealing it to a wider audience.) Would saying why I wrote a story help much? Would it give the slush reader the impetus to nudge it a little higher in the “stories for the editor to read” pile (provided the slush reader likes it enough to pass it on, of course)?</p>
<p>I don’t know. I’m not an editor. But I do know this: regardless of what happens with the story I’ve just been blogging about, I’m going to keep writing timely fiction, and if it gets published too late… well, I don’t think I’ll care, because it <em>will</em> get published.</p>
<p>Eventually.</p>

<p>Quick programming note: Escape Pod will be closed to submissions for the month of December. This is partly to get though a slight backlog of stories in the system now and also because as we get closer to the end of the pro-rate experiment we&#8217;ve got some things to figure out.  </p>

<p><strong>PLANETFALL</strong><br />
by Michael C. Lea</p>
<p>Galthas Talisar stepped out from the buzzing chaos of the transportal and onto lush greenery.  This world was alien, to be sure, but the patterns were almost familiar.  The ship&#8217;s oracles had chosen well.</p>
<p>Behind him, the transportal hummed again.  An armored leg emerged and carefully found its footing on the blue-green ferns carpeting the jungle floor.  More than twenty thousand miles above, the leg&#8217;s owner shifted his weight and stepped fully through an identical transportal, instantly emerging on the planet&#8217;s surface below.</p>
<p>That cautious step belonged to Urjik, who could be called cautious in few other ways.  In fact, his reputation had left him few other options for a willing partner on this mission.  Urjik did not care. He and Galthas had fought together against the worst the Zayeen had to offer.  He trusted Galthas implicitly, despite his disdain for the other scrawny ascetics from Signet Battalion.</p>
<p>Urjik&#8217;s greenish skin and jutting lower canines marked him as a charuk, his bloodline tainted by nether influences.  Despite this stigma, and despite his temper, he had risen quickly in Rampart Battalion.  Even the most burdensome battlesuit did not slow him, and no one was a truer shot with an inferno cannon or a hex-impelled railgun.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/2010/11/18/planetfall/">Read More&#8230;</a><br />
<span id="more-1493"></span></p>
<p>Galthas, by contrast, had the pale skin and slight build of the feytouched.  Unarmored and with no visible arms, he was nowhere near as physically imposing as Urjik.  Those who had seen Signet Battalion in action, however, knew that his bulky cold-iron armbands were weapons as formidable as any firearm or battleaxe, and far more versatile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Air&#8217;s a little thick,&#8221; Urjik said, &#8220;but it breathes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could have told you that,&#8221; Galthas replied softly, &#8220;since you insisted I go first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Urjik flashed a tusky grin.  &#8220;I thought that was protocol,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I always follow protocol.&#8221;</p>
<p>Galthas frowned back over his shoulder at the armored charuk, but said nothing.  His companion was irrepressible, but Galthas had not quite recovered the use of his sense of humor yet.  It was one more thing the Zayeen had taken.  Perhaps here, on this world, they could find themselves again.</p>
<p>The transportal winked out behind them, the thaumaturgic sigil in its keystone deactivated from the other side.  No one else would be coming through.  For such a vital mission there would ordinarily be at least a full squadron, with clockwork or golems for logistical support. Here, as on dozens of other mission sites, there were only resources for a two-man team.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which way is it?&#8221; Urjik asked, looking around warily.  The air was warm and humid, and buzzed with strange insects like fat blue bees.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should be within twenty meters,&#8221; Galthas said.  &#8220;This way, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>They moved through the brush, Galthas sliding quietly, Urjik with the subtlety of a tank.  His armor&#8217;s servos whined as he plowed through flora and fauna alike.  The cluster of large multicolored crystals jutting from the center of the armor&#8217;s back glowed as the suit drew power from them.</p>
<p>The undergrowth thinned.  A clearing lay just beyond.  They could feel a vibration in the air¸ an indefinable high-energy presence, like a gathering thunderstorm.</p>
<p>Galthas turned back.  &#8220;Ready?&#8221; he asked.  &#8220;Either this is it, or this is something very bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Urjik hefted his high-powered Vindocladian inferno cannon to his shoulder and aimed its sigil-carved barrel into the clearing.  Inside the bulky rifle&#8217;s main housing, a nether imp was caged, writhing in immortal fury but jacketed securely in heavy-duty curse-proofed lead.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of these days that thing&#8217;s going to backfire,&#8221; Galthas said, &#8220;and all your kids will end up with tentacles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Urjik shrugged.  &#8220;They&#8217;re already gonna have tusks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Galthas silently parted the foliage and advanced into the clearing. The source of the disturbance in the air was immediately apparent.  In the center of a small field of yellow-orange flowers, a geyser of light fountained six meters into the air, too bright to look at. Galthas looked down at his armbands.  The fey glyphs carved into them were shining with power.  Behind him, Urjik struggled with his rifle as if fighting recoil; the angry imp inside was soaking up energy. His armor&#8217;s fuel-crystals grew brighter, their flaws and occlusions shining like stars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bespeak the ship,&#8221; Galthas said, his voice heavy with emotion.  &#8220;Tell them the oracles were correct.  Tell them we&#8217;ve found a sourcewell.&#8221; Tell them the lights will stay on and the ships will not starve.  Tell them our world is dying, but our people may yet survive.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Most people on Ashter had heard of the Zayeen before they came roaring out of hyperspace bent on genocide, but few thought much about them. They were frequent trading partners, but casual visits in either direction were rare.  Their world Zayid was rich in certain rare earths and metals, but the people themselves were generally regarded as physically repugnant and culturally backward.</p>
<p>The Zayeen were fanatical servants of a harsh and exacting deity, while the Ashterites practiced a genial animism whose very formlessness offended their rigid neighbors.  In order to secure a vital trade route, the Ashterite military had established a base on Zayid, inadvertently trespassing on one of many holy lands and thus sowing the seeds of their own eventual ruin.</p>
<p>Resentment on Zayid built over generations, until a swift and bloody coup left the Crusader faction in charge.  The first wave of the Holy Zayeen Crusade departed for Ashter within weeks of the coup.  In terms of technology, they were completely outmatched by the Ashterite military, but they brought with them a secret weapon that the Ashterites could never have anticipated.</p>
<p>The Zayeen Crusaders had roused their dark god from its slumber.  It flew alongside them, ringing with righteous fury, eager to descend upon the sinning Ashterites.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>The sourcewell, of course, came with its own complications.  It seemed as if nothing would come easy, ever again.</p>
<p>Galthas and Urjik found out about the aliens immediately after bespeaking the good news back to their ship.  This close to the sourcewell, the bifurcated mimic-daemon in Urjik&#8217;s thaumaturgic squawkbox transmitted powerfully and received clearly.  The mimics were bred to produce conjoined twins, and separated soon after birth. Whatever one perceived, the other repeated, no matter the distance between them.  Although the little daemons lived their entire lives separated, Galthas occasionally wondered if they ever longed for their missing halves.</p>
<p>While Urjik contacted the ship, Galthas sat and meditated on the sourcewell, feeling the fey energies dancing in his armbands.  He sat at the very edge of the grassy clearing, and came no closer to the well itself.  Any sentient being who strayed too close would be entranced, drawn irresistibly into the Source to be annihilated.  The sourcewells were vital, they were the stuff of life itself; but they were also deadly.</p>
<p>Urjik&#8217;s heavy tread had announced his presence long before he spoke. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got company,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;Maybe half a klick away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Galthas reluctantly left meditation behind.  &#8220;Zayeen?&#8221; he asked, eyes still closed.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Urjik said.  &#8220;Something else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before they left, Galthas decided to conceal the sourcewell.  There was no way of knowing how the interlopers might react to it, or try to exploit it.</p>
<p>Galthas fell into a stance, spreading his feet wide.  He flexed his knees, and felt the earth below hold him in its grasp.  He flattened his palms, swung his arms into the ready position, and prepared to carve his will into reality.</p>
<p>His hands moved, weaving glyphs in the air, leaving a shimmering trail hanging in the empty space behind.  Inside the bracers clasped around his forearms, captive fey wildlings shone brightly in response to his will.  Their power flowed through a web of microtubules of cold iron, spinning through complex circuits until it emerged, shaped into signs transcribed from Galthas&#8217; mind onto the face of creation.</p>
<p>Galthas drew a point, a line, a curve, suggesting the sweep of a clock&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>cen(x,y,z):=-45.0892, 207.6823, 32.3342<br />
rad:=20m</em></p>
<p>Next, an oval circumscribed by a circle:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>set perc:=from perc1 to perc5<br />
for all perc from cen(x,y,z) to arc(cen,rad,360)</em></p>
<p>Finally, a Moebius-like closed loop, curving back upon itself, to establish the simple recursion:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>perc:=perc+dist(dist(cen,rad),perc)<br />
next perc</em></p>
<p>The glyphs hung in midair, shimmering.  Galthas waved them together. They joined, overlapping, connecting in the proper places to allow power to flow through the newly-defined system.</p>
<p>Galthas thrust his hands into the glyph, vertically aligned, right over left.  Power crackled through his armbands as they intersected the potent symbol.  He then rotated his arms, as if turning a wheel, until his hands were horizontal.  The glyph rotated with them a full quarter-turn, locking into place with an impact he could feel in the pit of his stomach.  Reality&#8217;s tumblers clicked over one another, and the world was changed.</p>
<p>The sourcewell and its clearing vanished instantly, replaced by more jungle.  Anyone looking in the well&#8217;s direction would not only fail to see it; their steps would be guided subtly around it.  It would be safe from tampering or exploitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; Galthas said, &#8220;let&#8217;s go meet our visitors.&#8221;</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>When the astronomers first spotted it, they thought it was a mistake. It flew alongside the Zayeen fleet, gliding in and out of conventional space, radioactive auroras trailing in its wake in sinister serpentine waves.  When it was too consistent to be labeled a mistake, they thought it was a massive ship, a dreadnought on a scale heretofore never seen.  Even that would have been much better than the truth.</p>
<p>The truth, which they saw once the Zayeen fleet breached visual range, was that it was a <em>Vulcalisk gargantua.</em></p>
<p>As far as the scientists on Ashter knew, no one had ever seen one alive before.  The only known specimen had been discovered near Zayid, by the Ashterite military garrison placed there.  A subsequent joint expedition had fully explored the site in all its awful grandeur.  The beast lay coiled around a shattered planetoid, with the crumbling remains of a world smeared around it as an asteroid belt.  The planetoid was scarred, obviously by the creature&#8217;s external assault, but it seemed to have been shot through with a network of fine holes as well.</p>
<p>There was nothing left of the planet-sized monster but bones.</p>
<p>They had considered it an anomaly, a unique aberration, but they had named the species nonetheless.  It held the popular imagination on Ashter for some time; reconstructions, artistic speculations on what it had looked like alive, and even fictional entertainment featuring the gargantua as destroyer or savior were all eagerly devoured by a captivated public.</p>
<p>But the Zayeen – the Zayeen had insisted it was a god.  They even had their own name for it, terrifying and unpronounceable.  They were rapturous at its discovery and thought the Ashterites&#8217; whimsical fascination filthy and disrespectful.  The Ashterites, for their part, thought the talk of god-bones laughable, but never snickered too loudly or in mixed company.</p>
<p>When the Zayeen emerged from hyperspace with their scaly god behind them, sculling the solar winds with its massive crocodilian tail, the Astherites stopped laughing.  They knew the Zayeen worshipped the beast, but never imagined that the fanatics could find or clone a live one, much less tame it.</p>
<p>The <em>Vulcalisk gargantua</em> tore through their defenses and blotted out the sun, hungry for the hot marrow of Ashter.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>The aliens were &#8220;something else&#8221; indeed.</p>
<p>Their scanners revealed that the ship was like a coffin; a lifeless box of metal, hollowed out, with stubby wings that imitated flying things but were not animated by any sort of life-force.  To Galthas and Urjik, it was like seeing a rock or a corpse that flew.</p>
<p>A door in the ship&#8217;s belly hissed open, powered by some motive force that was not immediately apparent.  The thing that waddled out was tripartite; three arms, three legs, no head to speak of, a ring of watery green eyes around its midsection and a central mouth where its neck should be.  Its flesh was gray and rubbery, with irregular patchy tufts of reddish hair.  It was draped in metallic ornaments, many of which seemed permanently attached.</p>
<p>Galthas and Urjik stood their ground, ready for anything.  Urjik had relegated his cannon to a shoulder mount and now held a telescoping battleaxe that he had unfolded from its housing in his armor. Galthas&#8217; bracers had sprouted shimmering bucklers and stubby blades of fey energy.  Both stood ready for battle at any sign of aggression. They had been caught unawares by the Zayeen.  Never again.</p>
<p>Then the tripod-thing spoke, and a box on its chest echoed its words. Galthas and Urjik both started; they were quite certain that no creature or spirit nested within the box, and a talking cube of metal was unheard of.  Unfortunately, both the tripod and the box spoke gibberish.</p>
<p>The rubbery creature pointed to the box, then to its own mouth, then to Galthas.  When there was no response, it said something unintelligible and repeated the gesture.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think it wants us to talk?&#8221; Urjik asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; Galthas responded.</p>
<p>So they talked.  They spoke of the war.  Urjik talked of the gargantua, of how it wrapped itself around their world and sunk its teeth, with tips as broad as cities, deep into Ashter&#8217;s hide.  He talked of the destruction, or claws that rent continents asunder, of the flight into their great voidfaring ships, living creatures like gigantic levitating horseshoe crabs.</p>
<p>Galthas talked of the desperate fight to slay the gargantua, of witnessing the deaths of hundreds of thaumaturges of Mirror Battalion who died affixing talismans to one of the impossibly huge creature&#8217;s eye-sockets.  He talked of Rampart Battalion&#8217;s heroism as its fighters, Urjik among them, wielded weapons bearing talismans mated to those affixed to the gargantua.  They had fired bolt after bolt of imp-spawned hellfire, projectile after projectile, until their power crystals had all dimmed and their ammunition was exhausted.  Every shot from a thaumaturgically-marked weapon curved in its path and unerringly sought its companion talisman affixed to the gargantua.</p>
<p>They spoke of the evacuation, of how the transportals had burned until the sourcewells sputtered out.  Until the soul of Ashter perished in one final paroxysm as the gargantua spewed the planet&#8217;s lifeblood out into the void.</p>
<p>Urjik spoke fiercely of the gargantua&#8217;s death-throes, of how it locked onto Asher with its tail and all six legs as it perished, curling around their world just as the ancient skeleton had been found curled around a shattered, dead planetoid.  Galthas spoke softly of the decision to flee, of the main fleet leaving Ashter to seek out another homeland, while their still battle-ready companions stayed to try to repulse the remains of the Zayeen fleet.</p>
<p>And then the alien spoke in their language – or at least, its box did. &#8220;Thanks be you for to discuss words,&#8221; the box buzzed out.  &#8220;This one Prime Speaker, Loban Fleet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Galthas and Urjik looked at each other.  The box was a piece of dead metal that learned languages.  They had met other spacefaring races, but this was truly alien.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Galthas, and this is Urjik,&#8221; Galthas said.  &#8220;Of . . . of Ashter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pleased are we of Loban to know you,&#8221; the Prime Speaker said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we . . . you,&#8221; Galthas replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;For how long are you staying this orb?&#8221; the alien asked bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are refugees,&#8221; Galthas said.  &#8220;Our home . . . can no longer support us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Loban Prime Speaker paused.  His large green eyes blinked several times in succession.  Finally, he said, &#8220;We welcome you as competitors in spirit of fair play.&#8221;</p>
<p>Urjik frowned.  Galthas held up a hand to keep him silent and said, &#8220;We hope that, in this time of loss and tragedy, we can count on the assistance and cooperation of the Loban people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We welcome all competitors who wish to contend freely,&#8221; the Prime Speaker said quickly.  &#8220;We seek a resource.  Spotted from high-altitude scan.  Strange light-fountain, high energy, very unusual.  Was here, but now is not.  Seen this resource, have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s talking about the sourcewell, Galthas realized.  Was it possible that these Lobans had advanced all the way to interstellar travel without ever encountering a sourcewell?</p>
<p>Whatever the answer, he knew that he could not risk being cut off from the well.  His entire civilization would collapse without a usable energy source.  This was all they had.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been traveling long,&#8221; Galthas said.  &#8220;We are very tired.  We must return and convey your greetings to our leaders.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Loban blinked several eyes.  Maybe it was the equivalent of a nod. Then it abruptly turned and marched back into its ship.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>That night, they watched Ashter die.  They established visual communication with the ship, intending to report on their encounter with the Loban ship.  But they were confronted instead with their Section Commander, red-faced and puffy-eyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to have to be the one to show you,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you have to see it down there alone.  But we all have to see it.  We all have to watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; Urjik asked, although on some level, they both knew already.</p>
<p>Fresh tears coursed down the Section Commander&#8217;s cheeks.  Neither Galthas nor Urjik had ever seen the man so emotional.  He angrily wiped his face with his forearm.</p>
<p>&#8220;The damn thing was hermaphroditic, or asexual, or the gods only know what,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;We had everyone evacuated, we had the damn Zayeen lizard-troopers on the run, we were on the verge of implementing a plan to pull their big lizard off.  Someday we might have been able to go back.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Section Commander reached for something unseen, and the image hovering above the squawkbox changed to a view of Ashter, wounded but whole.  The corpse of the reptilian gargantua was still twined about the planet.</p>
<p>&#8220;The science boys say the eggs must&#8217;ve been encased in something super-dense, like neutronium,&#8221; the Commander&#8217;s voice said.  &#8220;They can&#8217;t figure out how any egg inside would survive that.  But we know there were two of them, and they passed right through the planet&#8217;s crust like it was water.  When they sank all the way to the core they fused, and . . .&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice broke off.  The image of the damaged planet spun quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we realized what was happening, there were volunteers. Hundreds.  They took all the golems and elementals and all the burrowing clockwork they could scrape together and they went back in to try to stop it.  We weren&#8217;t even sure Ashter would ever be habitable again, but they still went back in.&#8221;</p>
<p>They could hear the Section Commander sobbing.  On the image, something strange was happening to Ashter.  Volcanoes were erupting, so many and so violently that they were visible even when viewing the whole planet.  Chunks of rock, of the planet&#8217;s crust, spewed out into orbit and beyond.  But some of the chunks kept moving.</p>
<p>Some of them . . . were something <em>else</em>.</p>
<p>Creatures were bursting free of the planet&#8217;s crust, miniature versions of the giant lizard whose corpse draped Ashter.  Tiny in comparison to the globe itself, they still must have been as large as cities or larger.  At first just a few, then hundreds, then thousands burrowed free, bursting Ashter from within.  They swooped and dove through the planet&#8217;s remains, swimming through the solar currents and breathing in the quantum fog, devouring promising possibilities and exhaling death.</p>
<p>The planet collapsed, spreading into a bloody arc.  Galthas and Urjik watched as all that was left of their world, everything they had ever known, every place they had ever lived, everything they had ever hoped or longed for or wondered about, every mystery unsolved and every story untold, everything that had ever defined home to them bled out into the vacuum.</p>
<p>As the fragments cooled, the tiny gargantua abandoned them and turned on the corpse of their mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Always wondered what could have picked that thing down to its bones,&#8221; Urjik said, his voice thick.  Galthas turned to rebuke him, but held his tongue when he saw his burly companion&#8217;s face.  The charuk, too, was weeping openly.</p>
<p>Numbly, they made their report and received their orders.  Urjik wanted to attack the Loban ship right away, probably because he felt a deep need to strike back at something.  But he had a point; the sourcewell had to be defended.</p>
<p>Command wanted information, however.  They had quietly tagged the ship thaumaturgically, so it could be monitored from a nearby squawkbox. Scouts had encountered several derelict ships on the outskirts of the system.  If they were Loban ships, the Lobans might be grateful for information about them.</p>
<p>In the end, they were told to continue negotiating, and find out as much as possible without giving away vital information about their forces.  The Ashterites no longer had the resources to squander potential allies.  And while the temptation to inflict pain to still their own disquiet was there, High Command was determined that the remaining people of Ashter would not become like the Zayeen.  They would trust until given a reason to distrust, and seek the good in all beings.</p>
<p>We trusted the Zayeen, Galthas thought, and see where it got us.  But he accepted his orders and prepared for a long, sleepless night.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>The next day the Loban Prime Speaker asked them bluntly about their technology.  The Lobans had been monitoring them, it seemed, and regarded their equipment as strange or somehow sorcerous in nature.</p>
<p>Galthas pretended to not understand.  &#8220;Our devices are based on life, on binding simple spirits to do our will,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Prime Speaker blinked its eyes and fluttered its mouth a bit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are there . . . more of you coming to this world?&#8221; Galthas asked, and immediately winced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Subtle,&#8221; Urjik muttered behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; the Prime Speaker replied.  &#8220;As we said, we seek resources.  This is done in competition, as it should be.  Our location is secret of much seriousness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So the dead ships our scouts have spotted at the edge of this system are not yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Loban waved an arm dismissively.  &#8220;No, no.  Not Loban.  Some other race whose name we do not recall.  They were seeking resources also, quite urgently.  But they did not know this orb was present.  They tried to turn back, make for another system.  Apparently they failed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Galthas felt something cold worm its way through his gut.  &#8220;You knew they were in urgent need of resources?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Loban blinked.  &#8220;Yes, yes.  We communicated with them briefly.  It yielded nothing.  It was of little importance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you direct them to this planet?&#8221; Galthas asked.</p>
<p>The Loban seemed taken aback; it blinked all of its eyes at once, three times.  &#8220;We seek resources,&#8221; it said.  &#8220;This is done in competition.  All must compete for themselves alone, or the competition is impure.  These creatures were not Loban.  This orb was ours, found first by us.  Why would we want more competitors?&#8221;  After a pause, it added, &#8220;Of course, now that you are here, we anticipate striving for resources with you in the spirit of fairness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Galthas said.  He turned to Urjik and said, &#8220;Go back to our camp.  Tell Command the ships they found were not Loban.&#8221;</p>
<p>Urjik looked hesitant.  &#8220;Go,&#8221; Galthas told him, and he did.</p>
<p>Galthas contemplated the strange tripod-like alien.  Based on their brief interaction, he could not say that they might become bloodthirsty fanatics, like the Zayeen.  But they were incredibly indifferent, which might be just as bad.  The Loban&#8217;s lack of compassion for the beings it had allowed to freeze to death was chilling.</p>
<p>He turned back to the Loban Speaker.  &#8220;We accept your generous offer to compete for resources,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;And in return for your magnanimity, I wish to offer you the secret of our technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>When Galthas returned to camp, Urjik was nearly beside himself.  &#8220;The Lobans!&#8221; he said.  &#8220;I pulled &#8216;em up on the box – they got back in their ship and took off!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they, now?&#8221; Galthas asked.</p>
<p>Urjik pointed to the squawkbox.  An image of the Loban ship flying over the countryside hovered over it.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re headed right for the sourcewell!&#8221; Urjik said.  &#8220;But how did they find it again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably because I turned the ward off,&#8221; Galthas said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would you . . .&#8221; Urjik began.  But then he began to put it together, and fell silent.</p>
<p>As they watched, the Loban ship hovered closer and closer to the sourcewell.  They crossed the edge of the clearing, and kept going, edging closer and closer.  The nose of their shuttle clipped the edge of the column of blazing light.</p>
<p>The sourcewell flared, and instantly engulfed the Loban ship.  It burned blue-green for a moment, and then returned to white, all impurities consumed.  There was no sign the Loban ship had ever existed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently they have somehow advanced this far with absolutely no knowledge of the dangers of sourcewells,&#8221; Galthas said.  &#8220;Who could have imagined?&#8221;</p>
<p>Urjik stared at him, wearing a look of dawning horror.  He had been in favor of attacking them openly, but not this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bespeak the ship,&#8221; Galthas said wearily.  &#8220;Tell them the Loban expedition has met a tragic end.  Tell them there are no survivors.&#8221; Tell them that from now on, nothing comes easy.  Tell them that out here it&#8217;s every man for himself.</p>
<p>Tell them this is <em>our</em> world now.  Why would we want more competitors?</p>

PLANETFALL
by Michael C. Lea

Galthas Talisar stepped out from the buzzing chaos of the transportal and onto lush greenery.  This world was alien, to be sure, but the patterns were almost familiar.  The ship's oracles had chosen well.

Behind him, the transportal hummed again.  An armored leg emerged and carefully found its footing on the blue-green ferns carpeting the jungle floor.  More than twenty thousand miles above, the leg's owner shifted his weight and stepped fully through an identical transportal, instantly emerging on the planet's surface below.

That cautious step belonged to Urjik, who could be called cautious in few other ways.  In fact, his reputation had left him few other options for a willing partner on this mission.  Urjik did not care. He and Galthas had fought together against the worst the Zayeen had to offer.  He trusted Galthas implicitly, despite his disdain for the other scrawny ascetics from Signet Battalion.

Urjik's greenish skin and jutting lower canines marked him as a charuk, his bloodline tainted by nether influences.  Despite this stigma, and despite his temper, he had risen quickly in Rampart Battalion.  Even the most burdensome battlesuit did not slow him, and no one was a truer shot with an inferno cannon or a hex-impelled railgun.

Galthas, by contrast, had the pale skin and slight build of the feytouched.  Unarmored and with no visible arms, he was nowhere near as physically imposing as Urjik.  Those who had seen Signet Battalion in action, however, knew that his bulky cold-iron armbands were weapons as formidable as any firearm or battleaxe, and far more versatile.

"Air's a little thick," Urjik said, "but it breathes."

"I could have told you that," Galthas replied softly, "since you insisted I go first."

Urjik flashed a tusky grin.  "I thought that was protocol," he said. "I always follow protocol."

Galthas frowned back over his shoulder at the armored charuk, but said nothing.  His companion was irrepressible, but Galthas had not quite recovered the use of his sense of humor yet.  It was one more thing the Zayeen had taken.  Perhaps here, on this world, they could find themselves again.

The transportal winked out behind them, the thaumaturgic sigil in its keystone deactivated from the other side.  No one else would be coming through.  For such a vital mission there would ordinarily be at least a full squadron, with clockwork or golems for logistical support. Here, as on dozens of other mission sites, there were only resources for a two-man team.

"Which way is it?" Urjik asked, looking around warily.  The air was warm and humid, and buzzed with strange insects like fat blue bees.

"We should be within twenty meters," Galthas said.  "This way, I think."

They moved through the brush, Galthas sliding quietly, Urjik with the subtlety of a tank.  His armor's servos whined as he plowed through flora and fauna alike.  The cluster of large multicolored crystals jutting from the center of the armor's back glowed as the suit drew power from them.

The undergrowth thinned.  A clearing lay just beyond.  They could feel a vibration in the aircedil; an indefinable high-energy presence, like a gathering thunderstorm.

Galthas turned back.  "Ready?" he asked.  "Either this is it, or this is something very bad."

Urjik hefted his high-powered Vindocladian inferno cannon to his shoulder and aimed its sigil-carved barrel into the clearing.  Inside the bulky rifle's main housing, a nether imp was caged, writhing in immortal fury but jacketed securely in heavy-duty curse-proofed lead.

"One of these days that thing's going to ba...</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.maryrobinettekowal.com/"><img class="alignright" style="margin: 3px;" title="Shades of Milk and HOney" src="http://www.tianevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ShadesOfMilkAndHoney-263x400.jpg" alt="" width="263" height="400" /></a>While I do not read romances, and I have not read a book by Jane Austen since high school, I nevertheless decided to pick up Shades of Milk and Honey by <a href="http://www.maryrobinettekowal.com/">Mary Robinette Kowal</a>. She is a brilliant writer, and I trusted her to write something I could endure. As it turned out, enduring the book wasn&#8217;t a problem &#8212; the hard part was putting it down.</p>
<p>The choice of detail in Shades of Milk and Honey is exquisite. Everything is described in spare, precise language. I can still see the glass cherries, the nymph&#8217;s face hidden in the tree, the dark and stormy bedroom of a heartsick girl. There is not a single wasted word or padded scene. That makes Shades of Milk and Honey a quick read. There is very little action until the dramatic ending, but that does not slow the narrative down. The majority of the book is concerned with interactions between people &#8212; with word and gesture, thought and response. I found it enthralling.</p>
<p>I believe the plot will be familiar to readers of romance. Two sisters named Jane and Melody try to walk the narrow path that society has marked for them, with the threat of scandal and ruin pressing in on both sides. Mary Robinette Kowal does not pull her punches in her portrayal of traditional marriage as an economic arrangement between families. As the sisters cannot inherit, they must either marry well or fall into poverty when their father dies. Romance in this setting is a matter of survival. Melody, who is beautiful, has no shortage of suitors. Jane, on the other hand, is cursed with a big nose and brown hair, and believes that she will never find a husband.</p>
<p>The aspect of the book that has gotten the most attention is its magic. Mary Robinette Kowal has made her book&#8217;s magic small and subtle, to avoid breaking history. This was not an easy task, and she has spoken at length about it elsewhere. The magic is called Glamour. It is the art of folding the ether to produce small illusions &#8212; a dress on a mannequin, a piece of ambient music to liven a party, or an elaborate &#8220;glamural&#8221; that turns a room into a forest glade. Jane has a particular talent for glamour, which gets her into trouble before it gets her out of it.</p>
<p>Just as the magic has been carefully constructed so as to allow the Regency period to proceed more or less as it did in the real world, the language in Shades of Milk and Honey has been chosen to fit the period. Modern readers will notice obvious examples of archaic English, such as &#8220;shew,&#8221; but the overall effect is wonderfully subtle, making the book feel right without distracting the reader. Shades of Milk and Honey is a deceptively simple book resting on a foundation of solid research.</p>
<p>I am told that there are plans for another book, which will involve swashbuckling. I can&#8217;t wait. I had my doubts about this book at first, but I&#8217;m glad I gave it a chance, and I am looking forward to the sequel.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A friend pointed out to me on <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonbaki" target="_blank">Twitter </a>just the other day that as of this week, it is exactly one year since I picked up my first Stephen King book and started reading. That book was <em>Under the Dome</em>, which came out in November 2009, and I was utterly enthralled from beginning to end. As soon as I had finished I set myself the task of reading all of his work, in publication order. A year later and I have only reached <em>The Stand</em> – hey, it was a busy year – but I’m still loving every single word.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/dome.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1455" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/dome.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="313" /></a></p>
<p>As a genre reader and writer, it might sound surprising that I came so late to King’s work. While his career has had high points and low, he is generally considered a master of science fiction, horror, and just plain <em>writing</em>, ably treading the line between vast commercial success and quality content.</p>
<p>But the reason I only came to his gigantic body of work with his latest novel is that prior to this, I was a King snob. Commercial success on such a scale usually meant – so I thought – very poor writing. This is often the case, but it was that foray <em>Under the Dome</em> last November that taught me a very good lesson indeed, one that is second only to the pants<a href="#f1">*</a> rule.</p>
<p>It’s slightly oblique but I’ll try to explain. That lesson was: everything is about ‘the story’.</p>
<p>Okay? Hold tight. Here we go.</p>
<p>Currently we are continually bombarded with bad news about the publishing industry – about how publishing is on a downward slide, book sales are floundering while editors at the big houses flap to catch the next big trend or play it safe with unadventurous, unoriginal content. The industry is being shaken up by digital publishing and ebooks, while opportunities for new writers trying to get a break are shrinking more and more.</p>
<p>It would be easy, with all of this, to take a very bleak view, and certainly I’m not suggesting that the bad news is not true. If you were of a pessimistic nature you could lament the death of books and of writing as you sob into your cocoa in front of the TV. But there is one thing to remember amid this doom and gloom.</p>
<p>Writing and “the story”, to use some quasi-mystical catch-all, is all around us. Take a look at what you do during the day – strip out the day job (unless you actually make a living writing), the chores, the laundry, brushing your teeth, and look at what you do for entertainment, and what entertains you. I’m willing to bet that most of it, maybe 90%, is “the story”. And “the story” means <em>writing</em>.</p>
<p>There are more TV shows and films now than ever, and certainly in recent years a stonkingly good selection of exceptionally high-quality ones. It’s all “the story” – fiction, written by writers. And everything that surrounds it – special effects, marketing and merchandising, even the actors, producers, directors, crew, etc – are all there to deliver “the story” to us. The world of books is just one tiny facet – there are comics, television programmes, films, and games (video or otherwise). It’s all writing. It’s all “the story”.</p>
<p>Two things really crystalized this for me. Firstly, a couple of years ago I went to a comic convention which featured a host of writers and artists from DC Comics, including their commander-in-chief, Dan DiDio. During a weekend of panels and discussions, one thing became very clear. The DC universe is one giant story, a tale so big and sprawling that it literally covers the walls of several offices in New York. The job of DC is to deliver this to us, and to continue its development before passing the baton to the next batch of creators and producers. The same can be said of Marvel, or Image, or 2000AD, or any comic publisher or endeavour. The scale of it was quite frankly mind-blowing, and I came away from that con with my first suspicions about “the story” and how it impacted practically everything I did and was interested in and did.</p>
<p>The second moment of realisation came earlier this week, when I was fortunate enough to attend a small gathering of <em>Doctor Who</em> fans who were hosting an informal interview and Q&amp;A with <a href="http://www.daphneashbrook.com/" target="_blank">Daphne Ashbrook</a>, co-star of the 1996 US/UK <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(1996_film)" target="_blank">TV movie</a> with Paul McGann, currently visiting the UK. I’m a <em>Doctor Who</em> fan, I’m happy to admit, but I’ve always had difficulty with the TV Movie. This ‘difficulty’ has evolved from outright denial and upset (hey, I was a sensitive teenager in 1996) through to grudging acceptance of the production, so long as I didn’t actually have to watch it. So driving for an hour to see a co-star I wasn’t particularly interested in talk about a production I didn’t particularly care for seemed, beforehand at least, a bit of a chore. But, what the hell. When was this opportunity going to come up again.</p>
<p>Of course, it was a marvellous evening. Daphne was a delight, and kept us entertained for close to two hours on the ins and outs of her impressive career (come on, forget <em>Doctor Who</em>, she was in <em>Knight Rider</em>, <em>The A-Team</em>, and <em>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</em>; hell, even <em>Murder, She Wrote</em>). It was a revelation, especially when I realised that large parts of her lively discussion were her relaying to us the plot of these various shows, so we could have a better understanding of the role she played in each.</p>
<p>There it was. “The Story”. As an experienced actor, Daphne’s job is to deliver “the story” to us.  And “the story” means <em>writing</em>, plain and simple. Storytelling. Writing. Same thing.</p>
<p>So what’s the magic advice I distilled from all of this? Give up on the novel and try a screenplay? Not at all.</p>
<p>My advice is to realise that “the story” is everywhere, and like the guys from Pixar keep saying, “the story is king”. With this in mind, and knowing that writing is a never-ending quest to <em>get better</em>, it’s our job as writers to absorb as much of “the story” as we can. This means reading outside of our comfort zones and genres as well as within them – if I didn’t decide to try Stephen King I would never have discovered his extensive, and quite wonderful, back catalogue. When I was prepping to write a detective noir novel, I decided to bite the bullet and read <em>The Big Sleep </em>by Raymond Chandler. <em>Whammo</em>, the whole world of pulp detective fiction was opened to me.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/sleep.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1456" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/sleep.jpg" alt="" width="307" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>One often-quoted piece of writing advice is to not just turn off your television, but to get rid of it entirely. Stephen King himself goes off on this in <em>On Writing</em>. A lot of writers follow this advice to the letter and do very well indeed. But personally I think this is missing the point, because between the inane loops of twenty-four hour news, reality shows and quizzes, the blowhards that King describes so well in his memoir of the craft, there is some damn good stuff on, be it a television series (old or new) or a film (old or new). So if “the story” is about writing, then by picking and choosing carefully and by not letting it become a time-sink (and that really is where the danger lies and the advice stems from, I think), you can watch, enjoy, and <em>learn from</em> some very, very good examples of the craft.</p>
<p>“The story” is everywhere, and where the story is, you&#8217;ll find writing. That will never, ever go away, no matter what weekly slice of negativity comes from the traditional publishing industry. The world needs writers and always will, because our whole lives are based around storytelling.</p>
<p>Read books. Watch TV. Go to the movies. But importantly, read something you might not have thought you’d like, and watch a film that isn’t quite the genre you are interested in. At worst, you’ll absorb another little slice of “the story” that you wouldn’t have otherwise and you’ll learn something from it. At best, you’ll discover something new and wonderful and whole news worlds will instantly become available.</p>
<p>And then think about it, and learn from it, and <em>write</em>.</p>
<p><em><a name="f1">*</a> The pants rule is pretty simple and surprisingly effective: when writing comes up on your schedule, make sure you are up and doing and dressed. Don’t write in your pyjamas, don’t write in your slippers, no matter how appealing or comfortable it may sound. By “pants”, I mean trousers (not, as British people use it, as underpants&#8230; stop sniggering at the back there!), but that’s just a metaphor for being prepared and ready to write. The more prepped you are – showered, shaved, dressed, in a nice pair of shoes – the better your writing. If you want writing to be your job then act like it. Put on a nice shirt, or skirt, not just your comfy “at home” clothes. You can put those on when you’ve finished your job. In fact, the more formal you make it, the better you tend to feel (although I can’t imagine what happens to your writing if you turn up at your desk in full evening wear or a ball gown… I must give that a go sometime). Try it. It works!</em></p>

<p><strong>Kachikachi Yama</strong><br />
By Michael R. Underwood</p>
<p>The howl of the  northbound train builds in crescendo as I stand on the ledge of the  platform and hold the man above the tracks.  He flails at me.</p>
<p>The Shikoku station is far from empty.  Groaning bodies dot the  otherwise hospital-clean platform. A group of fleshmodded Gothic Lolita  girls watch us.  They look on with inhumanly white faces and void-black  eyes.  Twig-thin arms down to their knees wave in the wind. He begs.</p>
<p>My _denkigami’s_ polite but insistent voice chirps  in my head.  _“Yamagata-sama orders the target to be eliminated.”_  Spirit of the fleshware machine in my brain, my _denkigami_ is a  constant companion, and keeper of my leash.</p>
<p>The roar of the train grows louder, and bells ring in the  station.  The man pleads for his life.  The train’s lights appear from  around the around the corner.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/2010/11/11/ep-266-kachikachi-yama">Keep reading&#8230;</a><br />
<span id="more-1465"></span></p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>My daimyo’s summons  comes at 3:27 in the morning.  My _denkigami_ wakes me, and within  minutes I crawl through the servant’s entrance to his office, dressed  and ready in simple white silk kimono, my hair in a topknot.</p>
<p>The walls of his office are covered in the finest works from a  millennium’s worth of painters.  Basho, Caravaggio, Monet, Kiefer.</p>
<p>Yamagata  Kenichiro has never met my gaze.  My father served him and his father,  and I will know no other master until I retire as a nun or die in his  service.</p>
<p>Samurai.  From _Samuru_&#8211;“to serve.”</p>
<p>Yamagata-sama  grunts. “My honor has been violated.”  He pushes a digital tablet  across his desk.  The tablet shows a 360-degree image of a  fleshmod-tanned hacker in his twenties, data-port centered in a swirling  tattoo on the back of his neck.</p>
<p>Yamagata stands and places a hand on the desk. “This criminal has brought shame upon my wife and upon my house.”</p>
<p>“What is your desire, lord?”</p>
<p>Yamagata-sama’s eyes narrow.  “First, befriend him.  Then, humiliate him.”</p>
<p>He has not ordered me to do this before. “Why not just kill him, lord?”</p>
<p>Yamagata  slams his fist on the table. “It is not enough.”  He walks around the  table, leans over me and draws a finger down my face and across my  chin.  “He must know ecstasy before he knows agony.”  I restrain the  shudder.</p>
<p>He has always treated me like a woman first, a serving maid who  could kill instead of a worthy member of a noble line.  This is not a  job for a samurai, but I do not have a choice.  I serve him to honor my  family’s name, prove that we were worthy of elevation to the samurai  caste.</p>
<p>I take the tablet with both hands as I bow.  I crawl back through  the low gap in the synthetic rice-paper walls while the side door&#8211;the  one for his peers&#8211;remains closed.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>I pore  over the files at the steel desk in my modest apartment in the servant’s  wing.  A seven-mat front room large enough for a couch and exercise  equipment, and a five-mat bedroom room connected to a compact bathroom.</p>
<p>Synthetic _shoji_ walls give me no privacy, thin as rice-paper but  made of plastic.  My red-lacquered family shrine stands centered on my  dresser.  When I was a child, I slept in the front room, ‘my’ walls  covered in holoposters of the latest idols.</p>
<p>The target’s alias is “Tanuki”&#8211;the raccoon-dog trickster of ancient folklore.</p>
<p>A  flash of memory&#8211;ancestral armor and bound bamboo. Lessons on  _bushido_. “The way of the past is a unified one, my little rabbit.   Samurai must listen to the past and speak to the future.”</p>
<p>And so father insisted that I learn the old tales in addition to the  old skills.  He always taught two things at once: religion and  endurance; bullets and _bushido_.  To fail either lesson was to fail  both.  He wanted a son, but since Empress Toshi wed the first Imperial  Denkigami and proclaimed the second restoration, women have been allowed  to bear the _daisho_&#8211;the paired _katana_ and _wakizashi_&#8211;so that they  might serve.</p>
<p>My father taught me how to live.  Now I have my _denkigami_ and Yamagata-sama.</p>
<p>The dossier gives his school background, address, frequent haunts, and a detailed psychological profile.</p>
<p>Yamagata’s  orders will force me to do things below my station, but I am thankful  it does not involve killing.  I have murdered fifty-seven people by  Yamagata-sama’s bidding, and in slumber, I still hear each of their  screams.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>I ‘randomly’ meet Tanuki at a hacker café in  the Akihabara district, known more commonly now as Kachikachi Yama, the  ‘matchstick mountain,’ where the fire of creativity burns hottest and  brightest, most creative and most dangerous.  It is the home of the  elite _tensai_ hackers and aspirants alike.  I spend an hour in front of  the mirror, painting myself like a Heian-era lady-in-waiting.</p>
<p>The café is decorated like the digital heaven _Denkigoku_  itself, great clouds for the lampshades, the bar rising out of sea-blue  floor, the design a stylized island from an ancient painting.  Intense  colors and soft lines make the building into a waking dream.</p>
<p>Not three paces into the café and I catch his eye.  The profile  tells me he likes the classical beauties, no obvious fleshmods&#8211;strange  contrast to his profession.  I wonder, who is this man really?</p>
<p>I  order a green tea and flirt with the peek of a wrist as I inhale the  steam rolling off the cup.  Then I approach the table with the tiny  steps required in my many layers of _kimono_.  I miss my loose fighting  clothes and their freedom of motion.</p>
<p>“May I join you?” Classical beauties yes, but he liked his women  aggressive.  He rubs his shaved head and gestures to the seat.   “Please.”</p>
<p>I set down the tea and sit daintily, playing my  part.  I think of his work, and begin to play him like a dating sim.   After hours studying his file, I know which movies to hate, what media  feeds to quote. I play the part of a devoted fan.  I am his desires  sculpted into flesh.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>We go out twice before I begin to do  Yamagata-sama’s bidding.  My _denkigami_ reminds me always of my orders,  so I move more quickly to avoid its censure.</p>
<p>I remember my  father on the floor, a broken island in a still ocean of blood, the  crater in the back of his head his punishment for refusing an unjust  order.  I obey my _denkigami_.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>We stand on an open plain, wheat stalks swaying in the digital wind of _Denkigoku_.</p>
<p>He  is teaching me to hack.  An attempt at romance.  I hear my father’s  voice in my head. “For the samurai, every experience is a lesson.”</p>
<p>Tanuki’s avatar is the squat raccoon dog which gives him his  handle&#8211;with comically-oversized testicles hanging to the ground.  Mine  is a samurai woman in kabuki style, all in red, lacquered armor and  painted face&#8211;red streaks over a white base.</p>
<p>He says my avatar is cute.  I ignore the urge to rip off the tanuki’s testicles.  I listen.</p>
<p>Tanuki activates a protective _denkigami_, a blue-skinned _oni_ with four arms and Indian clothes.  It stands at attention.</p>
<p>“Every _denkigami_ has a counter.  Like rock-paper-scissors with a thousand symbols.”</p>
<p>He  activates the program, and the _oni_ levels its weapons at Tanuki.   “Unauthorized passage is not allowed.  Please provide your access code.”</p>
<p>Tanuki strokes the fur on his chin. “With the right program, any  _denkigami_ can be conquered.” He reaches between his legs and pulls out  a pair of fans.  Doing a dance with the fans, he leaps side to side and  the _oni_ drops its guard.</p>
<p>“Proceed, honored guest.”</p>
<p>He bests another dozen _denkigami_  to show his prowess.  Each time, he knows the perfect tool.  He holds up  a _naginata_, the traditional weapon of a noblewoman.</p>
<p>“This is  how I hacked the _denkigami_ of the wife of a corporate daimyo.  To beat  a _denkigami_, turn its power against itself, make it follow the rules  that control it in a way that forces it to obey your request.  With this  icon, I turned her resentment against Yamagata’s control into a  weapon.”</p>
<p>I smile and flatter him.  I learn two lessons&#8211; deception and hacking.  My father would approve.</p>
<p>Tanuki’s  show is complete, and my true task begins.  I meditated on this, asked  my father for guidance on the unjust order.  But I am samurai, and I  must serve.</p>
<p>We leave _Denkigoku_ after his lesson, return to his spartan  apartment.  To show my ‘thanks,’ for his indulgence, I take him to bed.   He is enthusiastic, clumsy, and greedy, drinking of my body.  I close  my eyes and think of freedom.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>_Denkigoku_ swirls into being when I dream, and I am again trapped by the spirits of those I’d killed.</p>
<p>I  lay on a green island floating in the vast sea of heaven, home to  machine spirits, the restless dead and the great spirits of nature.</p>
<p>Naked.  I’m always naked.  My protestation of purity or my weakness  before their rage?  I stand and snap off a branch from the island’s lone  bamboo tree and hold it like a blade.  I wait.</p>
<p>They come in twos  and threes, shining echoes of my victims.  Carried on the winds of  their screams, they fly at me; form a cloud as I wave them away with the  branch.</p>
<p>I plead with the dead. “Enough!  You must move on!  It was my duty!” the same words, the same response.</p>
<p>“Murderer!  Demon!  Vengeance!”</p>
<p>They  tear at me with bloodied claws.  The cuts cover my body in waves as the  branch passes through their red-soaked clothes.  A hand slaps away the  branch.</p>
<p>They knock me to the ground, and I curl into a shaking ball as their  screams mix with the sharp wind.  My scream joins the chorus.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>Tanuki  leaps out of bed when I wake him with my screams.  He tries to comfort  me, his arm around my shoulders.  I escape to his shower and shudder  alone.</p>
<p>Wrapped in his black towels, I bring him tea when I return.</p>
<p>Tanuki  leans back and strokes a beard he doesn’t have. We lounge on a bed  three times the size of my futon, with real silk sheets, a memory-shaped  mattress, and mahogany bedposts in western style.  His fleshmod tan  glistens in the afterglow.</p>
<p>After a night of drenched sheets, spent condoms and still-echoing electronic bass, I move to the next part of the plan.</p>
<p>“I heard about this new fleshware modification.  They say it is wonderful for hackers.”</p>
<p>“Which one?” he asks.  As if there’s the possibility he has not heard of it.</p>
<p>“It’s  a selective synasthesia.  Good for working in _Denkigoku_ for hacking.   So I hear.”  The smallest edge in the machine spirit world can mean the  difference between glory and humiliation.</p>
<p>He nods. “A few of the _tensai_ have it.”</p>
<p>“And you’re  a _tensai_.” I smile wide and make him believe I think he is one of the  elite. “I think we should go and get it together.” My fingers trace  along his chin.  He shivers, and the sheets shift over his groin. “I  don’t think I need it,” he says with a smile of his own.</p>
<p>“I want you to hear my kisses and taste my moans, Tanuki.  To  dance to the symphony of you in me.  Will you do that, for us?”   Yamagata has made a samurai into a common concubine.</p>
<p>I push aside the sheets and slide my hands up his chest.  He dissembles, and I grit my teeth to contain my frustration.</p>
<p>“You’re tensai, but with this, you could be _Tensai Ichiban_.”   _Tensai Ichiban_, the number one hacker in the world, a coveted position  which led to many hackers’ ends by blades or bullets in back alleys or  digital mountaintops.</p>
<p>He leans back, looks at his wall of hardware, staring past the screens into his imagined future. “_Tensai Ichiban_.”</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>_Hanamichi_  is my favorite fleshware parlor, I tell Tanuki.  They are actually a  new Yamagata-Corp acquisition, but the deal has yet to reach the media.</p>
<p>Deep blue mood lighting fills the room, with gel-sculpted  couches, news feeds on the wall-panels, and local rock DJ-ed off one of  the flesh artist’s rigs.</p>
<p>Our artist is agelessly young,  fleshmodded to look like a golden age _anime_ heroine.  Her eyes take up  a quarter of her face, and her mouth is no wider than my thumb.</p>
<p>The artist explains the procedure to Tanuki.  The synasthetic  mod is sculpted to the sensory system, acting as a processing center for  sensory input.  Left alone, it channels the information to the  traditional centers.  When accessed consciously, it takes sensory input  and redirects it to be processed by other modalities.</p>
<p>Tanuki nods and I can see him salivating at what the fleshmod can  give him&#8211;the edge in _Denkigoku_, the power needed to vie to be _Tensai  Ichiban_.</p>
<p>That is what I want him to believe.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>We recover from the procedure for a week, letting the brain  acclimate to the possibilities.  The whole time, Tanuki can only talk  about becoming _Tensai Ichiban_.  He ignores the fleshmodder’s advice  and drinks, smokes, and paces around his apartment.</p>
<p>“This is going to be amazing, Yuriko.” He knows me by my mother’s name.  She took her life when my father died.  I was fifteen.</p>
<p>“Most  of these losers, they don’t even know about this.” He taps his head  where the skull was pulled back.  He winces, teeth flashing through a  grimace. “Everything in _Denkigoku_ will be different.  Data will sing.   Graphics will boil my blood.”</p>
<p>I smile again, and pretend to be weak from the procedure he thinks I  have had with him.  The fleshmod artist merely gave me the appropriate  scar, perpendicular five-centimeter cuts.</p>
<p>“That fucker Yamagata will never know what hit him.  It&#8221;ll even top what I did to his wife.”</p>
<p>“Yamagata?  As in the Yamagata Corporation?”  Feigning interest  is not hard, this time.  Hearing his side might illuminate  Yamagata-sama’s motivations for making a concubine of me.</p>
<p>“After  I slipped into his personal datanet and hacked his wife’s _denkigami_, I  had her go to him and screw.  He was surprised at first, but he got so  into it!  I had them do the dirtiest stuff&#8230;I doubt they’d screwed  since she squeezed out his heir!”</p>
<p>Tanuki clapped like a giddy child. “And then, just as he was finishing, I hacked her voicebox and told him what I did!”</p>
<p>This  was the affront that Yamagata-sama had assigned me to revenge.   Embarrassment for embarrassment.  Tanuki should notice my flared  nostrils, the clenched fingers, but he isn’t even looking at me anymore.</p>
<p>“And now I’m going to rob him blind so we can go around the world, Yuriko.”</p>
<p>I giggle for him, hand over mouth.  I hate Tanuki for the way I have to act.  I hate Yamagata-sama more.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>Tanuki buys sake and decorates his apartment, makes a party of  his first journey to _Denkigoku_ after having the synasthetic installed.</p>
<p>I  wanted it to be the two of us, but he insisted.  Eight of his hacker  friends are there, all fake-tanned like him, small men with big egos.   They congregate and talk about clan raids on the latest online pro  circuit.</p>
<p>He has three oversized screens suspended from the ceiling,  usually for his casual viewing pleasure.  Tonight, we will watch him as  he goes in for Yamagata Corp’s payroll.</p>
<p>After a few drinks,  some ranting about his expertise and the corruption of the Zaibatsu  feudal system, Tanuki begins.  He spreads the rice, says the chant, and  plugs in to make the journey to _Denkigoku_.  There, hackers style  themselves warriors battling digital _oni_ security systems and currying  favor with the _denkigami_, machine spirits of the new Japanese empire.</p>
<p>On my signal, my _denkigami_ makes the call to Yamagata-sama’s  men.  Its voice gives me confirmation.  _“We will wait now.   Yamagata-sama will be pleased.”_</p>
<p>The surreal world of  _Denkigoku_ swirls into visibility on the three screens.  Painted clouds  in ancient style dot the electric-blue sky, ten thousand _denkigami_  flying through the air, the traffic constant.</p>
<p>He walks across moss-covered bridges in the old style, under rows of  towering red _torii_&#8211;the sacred gates separating common space from the  sacred territory of the Yamagata Corporation.</p>
<p>Tanuki is  salivating like a dog, so enthralled by the synasthetic.  He brags as he  goes.  “This is amazing!  The air tastes like salmon.  The _torii_  sound like bells.”  Yuri, I wish you were here with me.”</p>
<p>I sip sake and watch as Tanuki walks into the trap Yamagata-sama has prepared.</p>
<p>The  white walls of Yamagata’s castle stretch three screens high, the  representation of the corporation’s digital holdings in _Denkigoku_.</p>
<p>Tanuki’s waddling avatar approaches the gate, facing looming  _oni_ with black skin and bulbous tusks and weapons three times his  size.  He laughs, his hands coursing through the air making commands.   The avatar reaches into its crotch to pull out the digital tool he would  use to trick his way past the _oni_ security.  Tanuki told me he  planned to use a hypnotic program he had been working on, represented by  a vintage _pokemon_.</p>
<p>Instead, his avatar pulls up a flapping _koi_ fish, which  splashes water in his face.  The avatar stumbles backwards and lands on  top of the oversized testicles.  The _oni_ draw closer.</p>
<p>“Please  provide your security code!”  Their voices bellow through Tanuki’s  speakers, maxing the audio.  The sound waves crash against my chest, and  I take another sip.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?  Come on, work, dammit!” Tanuki scrambles  backwards, flailing for the tool he needs, but all that will come out  are _koi_, each more unwieldy and useless than the last.</p>
<p>The  _oni_ run him off with pounding threats, and Tanuki’s so-called friends  laugh.  The piggyback program does its duty.  The synasthesia is  selective as promised in the earthly realm, but in _Denkigoku_, it is  completely random and incomprehensible.  His mind is convinced sounds  are touches, tastes are vision.  He will be permanently disabled in  _Denkigoku_, never able to hack again.</p>
<p>Yamagata-sama’s revenge is complete.</p>
<p>So I think.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>I  sit once more in Yamagata-sama’s study, in the attentive _seiza_  posture, feet and ankles tucked beneath me.  I have given my report.</p>
<p>Yamagata-sama strokes his beard and grunts wordless phrases.</p>
<p>“Well  done.  However, I am not satisfied.  He will suffer for a month, and  then you will dispose of him.  Take him to Shikoku.  Leave his body  there.”</p>
<p>I bow.  Fifty-seven spirits plague my dreams, and now  Yamagata-sama is telling me there will be one more, a tanuki with  plastic glasses.  First he debases me, and then makes my demeaning act a  cruel prelude to murder.</p>
<p>I crawl out of Yamagata’s office and return to my apartment to prepare.  I burn incense for my parents and go to kill Tanuki.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>Tanuki  proves himself not a total fool.  Five tattooed yakuza surround me in  the train station when I arrive, razorwire blades and outlawed guns  trained on me.  My hand rests on the hilt of my blade.  I wait.</p>
<p>Tanuki gloats. “Hello lover. A friend of mine tipped me off, so I  thought I’d bring some friends on our getaway trip.  How pissed do you  think he’ll be when I send his samurai lapdog’s head back to him?”</p>
<p>I don’t bother to respond.  The game is over; I do not have to pretend for him anymore.</p>
<p>For a long moment, the world is still, six bodies ready to explode into motion while Tanuki stands back and laughs.</p>
<p>A  tall man with a red dragon tattoo around his torso flinches, takes a  stutter-step forward.  I leap and draw.  Ancient steel cuts through  fleshmodded muscle.  An arm hits the ground.</p>
<p>I spin with soft steps, turning to keep the other four in my sight.</p>
<p>My  _denkigami_ chirps a warning in my head. _“Overhand blow, position  seven.”_ It warns me in time to tilt to the side and let the thin blade  cut the air beside my ear.</p>
<p>Two yakuza tackle me, thinking their mass enough to overpower  one small woman, samurai or not.  We crash into a pillar and my head  cracks against marble.</p>
<p>My _katana_ bursts from the back of  one&#8211;impaled by his own momentum.  I push and spin to pull out the  blade.  I slice at his companion, face fleshmodded to look like an  _oni_.  His skin is red, his nose bulbous, his mouth full of fangs.  My  grandfather’s sword widens his mouth to his cheekbone.</p>
<p>Two steps sideways and I reverse the blade.  My head drops as I  spin in place and kick a gun out of one’s hands.  _Katana_ follows foot  and splits the man’s collarbone.</p>
<p>My _denkigami’s_ warning to  roll comes too late.  Pain bursts in my back.  The blade clatters on  concrete.  My head cracks against the wall of a magazine stand.  Two  more pains blossom in my chest.</p>
<p>A steaming gun barrel stands in the air, held by a yakuza not  out of junior high.  I roll to the side and my vision tracks as if I’d  indulged in too much sake.  We lock eyes.  He flinches, and I pluck the  gun from his hand while he blinks.</p>
<p>A sharp elbow to the temple drops him to the floor.  I turn and  fire a bullet through Tanuki’s thigh as he runs up the stairs.  Tossing  the gun aside, I retrieve my target.  I lift him with both arms and move  to hold him over the edge.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>The lights of the train grow wider at the end of the tunnel as I hold Tanuki over the edge of the Shikoku line platform.</p>
<p>I grit my teeth from the strain.  I show him my real face, too long hidden behind makeup and insincere smiles.</p>
<p>“I am Ryoji Usagiko, vassal of Yamagata Kenichiro, and I have  been ordered to erase the stain you have made upon the honor of the  Yamagata.”</p>
<p>“Please, don’t kill me!  I’ll do anything, you hear?   I’ll work for Yamagata, apologize to his wife, hand over other hackers.   Please!”</p>
<p>He will join murderers and traitors, slave-runners and callous  _ronin_, more voice in the growing chorus of my nightmares.  He may  deserve death less than they, but he will scream for my death just as  loud.</p>
<p>My _denkigami_ in my head again. “The train will arrive in 7.3 seconds.”</p>
<p>Light  fills the platform. If I leave him, he will bankrupt himself seeking  revenge.  I let go and watch his eyes go wide as I let go.  He drops  below the platform.</p>
<p>I turn on the balls of my feet, walk past the nonplussed girls, and return to Tanuki’s apartment to complete one last task.</p>
<p>*    *    *</p>
<p>Yamagata  smiles when I give my report.  He walks out from behind his desk to set  a hand on my shoulder.  I bow with my hands together, each in the  opposite sleeve of my _kimono_.  The sentiment comes too late.</p>
<p>I draw the tiny knife from my sleeve and leap to my feet.  The  knife draws a crimson smile across Yamagata-sama’s throat, and I drop my  former master to the floor.</p>
<p>My _denkigami_ would have  stopped me, stayed my hand before I could act.  But I learned my lessons  well.  The once-constant voice is now quiet.</p>
<p>Looking down at my master, we lock eyes.  I watch surprise mix with outrage, then give way to fear.</p>
<p>“You  have violated the oaths of fealty between master and servant, dirtied  yourself and your vassals. The Ryoji family no longer has need of the  Yamagata’s patronage.” No other words have been as pleasurable.</p>
<p>The weight of my father’s murder drops from my shoulders as I leave Yamagata dying on the floor.  I leave by the side exit.</p>
<p>This time, I do not have to crawl.</p>

Kachikachi Yama
By Michael R. Underwood

The howl of the  northbound train builds in crescendo as I stand on the ledge of the  platform and hold the man above the tracks.nbsp; He flails at me.

The Shikoku station is far from empty.nbsp; Groaning bodies dot the  otherwise hospital-clean platform. A group of fleshmodded Gothic Lolita  girls watch us.nbsp; They look on with inhumanly white faces and void-black  eyes.nbsp; Twig-thin arms down to their knees wave in the wind. He begs.

My _denkigamirsquo;s_ polite but insistent voice chirps  in my head.nbsp; _ldquo;Yamagata-sama orders the target to be eliminated.rdquo;_  Spirit of the fleshware machine in my brain, my _denkigami_ is a  constant companion, and keeper of my leash.

The roar of the train grows louder, and bells ring in the  station.nbsp; The man pleads for his life.nbsp; The trainrsquo;s lights appear from  around the around the corner.

Keep reading...


*nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; *nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; *

My daimyorsquo;s summons  comes at 3:27 in the morning.nbsp; My _denkigami_ wakes me, and within  minutes I crawl through the servantrsquo;s entrance to his office, dressed  and ready in simple white silk kimono, my hair in a topknot.

The walls of his office are covered in the finest works from a  millenniumrsquo;s worth of painters.nbsp; Basho, Caravaggio, Monet, Kiefer.

Yamagata  Kenichiro has never met my gaze.nbsp; My father served him and his father,  and I will know no other master until I retire as a nun or die in his  service.

Samurai.nbsp; From _Samuru_--ldquo;to serve.rdquo;

Yamagata-sama  grunts. ldquo;My honor has been violated.rdquo;nbsp; He pushes a digital tablet  across his desk.nbsp; The tablet shows a 360-degree image of a  fleshmod-tanned hacker in his twenties, data-port centered in a swirling  tattoo on the back of his neck.

Yamagata stands and places a hand on the desk. ldquo;This criminal has brought shame upon my wife and upon my house.rdquo;

ldquo;What is your desire, lord?rdquo;

Yamagata-samarsquo;s eyes narrow.nbsp; ldquo;First, befriend him.nbsp; Then, humiliate him.rdquo;

He has not ordered me to do this before. ldquo;Why not just kill him, lord?rdquo;

Yamagata  slams his fist on the table. ldquo;It is not enough.rdquo;nbsp; He walks around the  table, leans over me and draws a finger down my face and across my  chin.nbsp; ldquo;He must know ecstasy before he knows agony.rdquo;nbsp; I restrain the  shudder.

He has always treated me like a woman first, a serving maid who  could kill instead of a worthy member of a noble line.nbsp; This is not a  job for a samurai, but I do not have a choice.nbsp; I serve him to honor my  familyrsquo;s name, prove that we were worthy of elevation to the samurai  caste.

I take the tablet with both hands as I bow.nbsp; I crawl back through  the low gap in the synthetic rice-paper walls while the side door--the  one for his peers--remains closed.

*nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; *nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; *

I pore  over the files at the steel desk in my modest apartment in the servantrsquo;s  wing.nbsp; A seven-mat front room large enough for a couch and exercise  equipment, and a five-mat bedroom room connected to a compact bathroom.

Synthetic _shoji_ walls give me no privacy, thin as rice-paper but  made of plastic.nbsp; My red-lacquered family shrine stands centered on my  dresser.nbsp; When I was a child, I slept in the front room, lsquo;myrsquo; walls  covered in holoposters of the latest idols.

The targetrsquo;s alias is ldquo;Tanukirdquo;--the raccoon-dog trickster of ancient folklore.

A  flash of memory--ancestral armor and bound b...</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&#8220;For my part, I prefer aliens that look alien. Then when they ritually eat their first-born, or turn arthropod halfway through their life-cycle, it isn&#8217;t so much of a shock. You expect it. Humanoid aliens, they&#8217;re trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211; Mary Gentle, <strong>The Golden Witchbreed</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few months ago, I finally picked up Mary Gentle&#8217;s science fiction duology, The Golden Witchbreed and its sequel, Ancient Light. The story that begins in The Golden Witchbreed is standard SF: A human ambassador arrives on an alien world to assist the first contact team, and finds herself snarled in local politics. The difference lies, first, in what those local politics turn out to be, and second, in Mary Gentle&#8217;s deft handling of character and interwoven plotlines.</p>
<p>The alien planet, Orthe, is inhabited by humanoid aliens who are just human enough to make the ambassador trip up &#8212; and the reader, too, if she&#8217;s not careful. The Ortheans are drawn with superb attention to detail. Most of the aliens that the reader meets in The Golden Witchbreed live in small holdings that answer to a larger, elected-as-needed assembly of representatives, and an elected monarch who rules by divine right. Mary Gentle does not make the mistake of having a One World Culture for her aliens, however, or even just a few variations on a theme.</p>
<p>As the ambassador travels away from the capital city, the reader gets to see one culture shade into another. I enjoyed watching the ambassador slowly adapt to Orthe. As her grasp of the language and social niceties moves from being trained, to being practiced, to being second nature, the vocabulary in her narration changes. The humans have classed the Ortheans as a pretech, but when a group of Barbarians arrive in the hollowed-out hull of an ancient flying machine, both the reader and the ambassador realize that something far stranger is going on.</p>
<p>The Golden Witchbreed is a good book, but it is not a complete story without Ancient Light. Ancient Light begins twenty years after the ambassador leaves Orthe. Political upheaval on Earth has left her without a government to represent &#8212; instead, she answers to the Company. Having discovered the ruins of an ancient civilization on Orthe, the Company wants to know whether any of the alien technology could be put to human use. Alien politics, human politics, alien religion, and the ambassador&#8217;s own shaky hold on her sanity raise the stakes in Ancient Light to the point where I finished this book standing up &#8212; because finding a chair would have meant looking away from the page.</p>
<p>Orthe is a world so finely balanced that mere observation by an outsider is enough to change the system. To me, these books read as a statement about invasion and colonization, though Mary Gentle never wields the message stick hard enough to make me confident that&#8217;s what she was trying to say. The Orthe duology is good science fiction, and has as much to say about our past as our future. I recommend these books without hesitation.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="Zero History" src="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/underwire/2010/09/Zero-History-cover.jpg" alt="" width="116" height="180" />With the possible exception of the Very Ugly Shirt, I think I&#8217;ve seen all of the technology in <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/" target="_blank">William Gibson&#8217;s</a> new novel,<em> Zero History</em>, featured on <a href="http://boingboing.net">BoingBoing</a>. <em>Zero History</em> is a science fiction novel because a science fiction writer wrote it. If it had been written by someone other than William Gibson, it could have been shelved with the thrillers. On the other hand, <em>Zero History</em> does two things that science fiction is supposed to do: It examines the impact of technology on human beings; and if the science was taken out, the plot wouldn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>Hubertus Bigend, the eccentric billionaire from <em>Pattern Recognition</em> and <em>Spook Country</em>, once again recruits the former rock star, Hollis Henry. This time he&#8217;s tracking a fashion genius whose anti-advertising has created an underground sensation. With the former benzo addict Milgrim, would-be military contractors, and a surprisingly straightforward romantic subplot, William Gibson pulls together another intricate and enthralling novel.</p>
<p>I found this book to be more ambivalent than the other two. Fear drives the characters. I have not figured out what Hollis is running from, aside from her mysterious and frightening benefactor. Milgrim is remembering what fear is like without sedatives to insulate him from the world. The generalized paranoia that underlies modern military-worship keeps the nominal bad guys moving through a series of misunderstood signals that might have been comic if the stakes didn&#8217;t feel so high. At the end, despite the protagonists&#8217; celebrations, I had the unsettling impression that the bad guys won.</p>
<p><em>Zero History</em> is a continuation of the series that started with <em>Pattern Recognition</em>. It brings back both the style and many of the characters from those books, not his earlier work. Gibson&#8217;s precisely-machined writing is a pleasure to read, as always. He lets his plot drift, so it feels like all the characters are sliding slowly and inevitably towards towards a single point of crisis. While <em>Zero History</em> never reaches the frenzy I remember from other Gibson novels, it kept me engaged until the end. Also, I adored the bit with the penguin.</p>
<p>I will reread this book.<em> Zero History</em> is not a stand-alone novel, and I believe I will benefit from reading the whole series in order. Readers who are looking for a return to <em>Neuromancer</em> will be disappointed. Fans of the other Bigend books should pick this one up, too.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[If I only read e-books, I'd never have stopped at the B&#38;N discount rack on my recent vacation and picked up <i>A Princess of Mars</i>. There's a reason it's a classic.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I&#8217;m going to miss terribly when e-books are the norm and brick-and-mortar stores are few and far between will be the opportunity to walk into a bookstore, pick up the one thing I really want to read, and then hit the discount rack on the way to the checkout. That&#8217;s exactly what I did when I was in Florida recently, picking up <a href="http://escapepod.org/2010/10/22/book-review-i-shall-wear-midnight-by-terry-pratchett/">I Shall Wear Midnight</a>, which I later reviewed on this site.</p>
<p>Among the books I picked up on my way out of the store was a three-pack of <em>John Carter of Mars</em> novels, by Edgar Rice Burroughs. I&#8217;d heard there might be a movie coming soon, and I wanted to familiarize myself with a sci-fi classic that I probably should&#8217;ve read long ago anyway.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve finished <em>A Princess of Mars</em>, I can sort of see why they&#8217;re classics. <em>Sort of.</em></p>
<p>Like many novels written in the late 19th/early 20th century, <em>A Princess of Mars</em> starts out with the discovery of a manuscript by the author himself, and his memories of &#8220;Uncle Jack&#8221;. Burroughs uses the device effectively to set up the mythology of John Carter, and then jumps into the story. The first act is fairly straightforward: Carter goes to Mars, discovers he&#8217;s stronger than most everyone there, and manages to impress the natives. Burroughs spends a lot of time describing this new world, and though most readers of current fiction would say <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tldr">tl;dr</a> or bemoan the author&#8217;s use of infodumps, that was the style back then, so I give it a pass. At the end of that act, he meets Dejah Thoris, the eponymous Princess of Mars, and decides he&#8217;s fallen in love with her.</p>
<p>By this point in the novel, I&#8217;d hit on its major sticking point &#8212; at least, in my mind &#8212; and it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve seen in other fiction of the era: John Carter&#8230; well, he&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p>No, he&#8217;s not awesome. He&#8217;s AWESOME. There&#8217;s literally nothing John Carter cannot do on Mars: he has superior strength, agility, martial prowess, physical attractiveness (as compared to humans of Earth, not the Green Men of Barsoom), problem-solving skills, intelligence, and luck. It&#8217;s like God rolled a series of <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=natural%2020">natural 20s</a> when He was creating Carter, and Carter knows exactly how to take advantage of that. He instantly figures out how to move in Mars&#8217;s lower gravity. He applies his knowledge of battle from the Civil War to fighting alongside several different alien races. He isn&#8217;t completely floored by the weird appearance of the Tharks (the green men of Mars). He learns to speak the Martian language and use Martian telepathy despite not &#8212; to our knowledge, anyway &#8212; knowing any languages other than English nor how to be telepathic at all beforehand.</p>
<p>And, what&#8217;s more, he instantly wins the trust of pretty much <em>everyone</em> around him. The few who don&#8217;t like him are so clearly Stereotypical Evil Characters that the reader knows almost immediately they&#8217;ll be getting some kind of comeuppance, most likely at Carter&#8217;s hands (or sword).</p>
<p>The rest of the story is spent on getting Carter back together with Thoris &#8212; they are separated in the second act &#8212; and it&#8217;s kind of blah through there (there&#8217;s even a pod racing scene, sort of) before the grand finale, when Carter leads the good Martians against some really, really, unmistake-ably <em>evil</em> Martians. Kind of like how, in Star Trek 6, there were honorable Klingons and evil Klingons.</p>
<p>Overall, I really enjoyed the book. There was lots of adventure, interesting scenery and worldbuilding, and if the aliens were a little too human, that&#8217;s not really a failing &#8212; it&#8217;s just the way stories were written back then. Besides, the characters are consistent within themselves &#8212; none of them do anything that immediately drags you out of the story. The ending wraps up a little too fast, as stories from that era were wont to do, but that&#8217;s okay, because we know there&#8217;ll be more John Carter of Mars stories coming up. I feel bad for readers of that era, who didn&#8217;t know there&#8217;d be more.</p>
<p><em>A Princess of Mars</em> is short enough that you can read it in a weekend, if you read at a good clip. The version I have has some very nice illustrations by Thomas Yeates, and an introduction by Mike Ashley that lays out the history of the Barsoom series. The book itself is suitable for reading by mature tweens who are already into sci-fi or adventure stories, though the illustrations do contain PG-13 nudity (Carter himself shows up naked on Mars, and to assimilate with the Tharks, he forgoes clothing as they do). I&#8217;m glad I picked it up, and I&#8217;m currently enjoying the second book, <em>Gods of Mars</em>, which is part of the omnibus.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="Gregor the overlander" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/95/The_Underland_Chronicles_-_Gregor_the_Overlander.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="318" />I am the mom of an eight-year-old, so I do keep up with the kids&#8217; book market, but I chose these books because they were written by the Queen of Pacing, Suzanne Collins, author of the huge hit, <em>The Hunger Games</em> trilogy. (Which I loved, despite the disappointment of <em>Mockingjay</em>, but that&#8217;s another blog post.) When I found that she&#8217;d written five midgrade novels, I got them via <a href="http://www.emusic.com" target="_blank">eMusic</a>. (not an affiliate link, I do love eMusic for their catalog and their non-DRM files.)</p>
<p>Here is where I&#8217;m firmly believing that tropes and clichés don&#8217;t kill stories; bad writing kills stories. If I told you the basic plot- boy in our world falls into mysterious magical underground kingdom were he&#8217;s prophesied to save them all, you&#8217;d snort and say, &#8220;oh, <em>that&#8217;s</em> original.&#8221; But so what? Original or not, Collins makes it awesome.</p>
<p>Gregor is eleven, and a pretty responsible kid, since his grandmother has dementia and his mom takes care of him, his seven year old sister Lizzie, and his two year old sister Boots. His dad disappeared over two years ago, and he&#8217;s had to take on a lot of the childcare (and elder care) since his mom works to support the five of them. He falls into the Underland, where they immediately treat him like a dirty stranger (they keep insisting he bathe) and he inadvertently offends them frequently. Then we find out about the prophesy, and the giant rats, and a quest, and it&#8217;s a whole thing.</p>
<p>What makes Collins&#8217; work shine is, of course, her pacing, which keeps me sitting in the car long after I&#8217;ve gotten home to get to the end of a chapter. But her characters are also awesome. Gregor should show a little more fear as an eleven year old- he admits to a fear of heights, but we never see this fear manifest- but he&#8217;s a solid kid who&#8217;s smart but impulsive. The surprise is how well his two year old sister fits into the story. Boots is charming and fun and has a weird ability to tell the giant cockroaches (&#8220;crawlers&#8221; is the polite term) apart, something the Underlanders can&#8217;t even do. When she has a tantrum in the first book, it&#8217;s perfectly suited to the situation, and even comes in handy as they&#8217;re captured by some creatures who don&#8217;t like loud noises.</p>
<p>Sometimes it seems a little too easy traveling with a two year old (I seem to remember my two year old not being so ready to accept a brand new schedule, never mind constant adventure), and the descriptions in the underland sometimes seem too clear to allow for the amount of light they had available, but those are minor complaints to an otherwise fun read.</p>
<p>Prophesies, other lands, and heroic outsiders are common tropes in fantasy, but give them to a talented writer, and you will still have a book you can&#8217;t put down. I&#8217;ve finished the first two, <em>Gregor the Overlander </em>and <em>The Prophesy of Bane</em>, and I&#8217;m eager to get the other three. Highly recommended for any mid-grade reader (or adult) who loves adventure.</p>
<p>(Since this is an audio podcast, I should mention the audiobook is a great listen, the narrator giving life to the characters. The consistency isn&#8217;t the same through the books, though, which is irritating. A major rat character sounds bored and sardonic in book 1 and scratchy and mean in book 2&#8230;.)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like many writers, I&#8217;m not very good at making time to write. My days are, well, packed. I&#8217;m up at 5:15 to go to the gym, on the road at 7:20 to commute to work, at my desk by 8:30, back on the road between 5:30 and 6:00, home by 6:45 if I&#8217;m lucky, having dinner and spending time with the kid, then after she goes to bed I have to pack my stuff for the next day, make lunches, and am lucky to have half an hour to myself before going up to bed between 9:15 and 9:30. There I read for 15 minutes to unwind my brain, and then lights out.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing that I manage to write <em>anything</em>, given that crazy schedule.</p>
<p>A friend of mine said that if I love writing, I shouldn&#8217;t give it up to exercise, but if you&#8217;ve seen me, you know I need it. I accept that. It&#8217;s why I joined the gym in the first place.</p>
<p>But I do write. A little, here and there. Sometimes at work, sometimes in the evenings, sometimes on the weekends (which are consumed by family time for the most part). I remember reading somewhere that David Mack, when he started out, would write for a few hours at night, giving up sleep in favor of writing<a href="#jr_nano1">*</a>. I tried that too. The thing is, I&#8217;m not one of those people who can just sit down and start writing, especially if I&#8217;m in the middle of a story. I need to be in the zone &#8212; reread a little bit, get back into the characters, remember what I wanted to do next, and then actually be able to do the writing (and have enough time to do it, like people who write on their lunch breaks).</p>
<p>Why am I telling you all this?</p>
<p>Because I&#8217;m jealous. I&#8217;m extremely jealous, in fact.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> is this month, and I&#8217;m not doing it.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m jealous of people who have the commitment and the drive and above all else the ability to make time to write 50,000 words in a month. Which isn&#8217;t to say I <em>can&#8217;t</em> do it &#8212; I wrote a 17,000-word novella in a couple of weeks, back in early 2009. But right now isn&#8217;t my time. Nor was last year. Or the year before that. Or the year before that. And so on. I accept that.</p>
<p>But do you follow any writers on Twitter? Because if you follow folks like <a href="http://twitter.com/nobilis">Nobilis</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/voidmunashii">Void Munashii</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/inkhaven">Inkhaven</a>, or your favorite fanfic writer (a <em>lot</em> of them do it), you&#8217;re seeing word counts, status updates, messages of joy as your writer friends reach milestones&#8230; and the bad stuff too: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t write today.&#8221; &#8220;My plot isn&#8217;t working out.&#8221; &#8220;This story sucks, but I have to finish it.&#8221; &#8220;I lost all my saved files.&#8221;</p>
<p>I like my writer friends, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but reading their progress reports just makes me sad. As a writer without the time or the ability to make said time, all I can do is look on and occasionally offer congratulatory or sympathetic messages. And I can tell myself, &#8220;maybe next year.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been telling myself that for five years now. Might as well keep up the tradition in 2011, too.</p>
<p>And now, your reward for reading my self-indulgent whining: a music video for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhs-yodZJcw">&#8220;The Nanowrimo Song&#8221; by All Caps.</a> Enjoy.</p>
<p><a name="jr_nano1">*</a> <em>This may be apocryphal<a href="#jr_nano2">**</a>, but I&#8217;m sure Mack isn&#8217;t the only writer to ever do this.</em></p>
<p><a name="jr_nano2">**</a> <em>As Mack noted in the comments, this is indeed true. I should&#8217;ve said I might be misremembering &#8212; totally my bad on the incorrect use of &#8220;apocryphal&#8221;. Sorry about that.</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Y’know, Halloween has always felt like the perfect time for storytelling. Whether it is ghost stories by the campfire, or Hammer horror from the comfort of your own living room (my personal preference), its just the perfectly obvious season for the supernatural and scarifying. While it has ever been thus for people like you and me, it seems to be catching on in the mainstream too. AMC’s zombie TV series <a href="http://www.amctv.com/originals/The-Walking-Dead/" target="_blank"><em>The Walking Dead</em></a>, based on the Eisner award-winning <a href="http://www.hiddenrobot.com/WALKINGDEAD/" target="_blank">comic book series from Image</a>, premiered to their biggest debut audience ever at 5.3 million viewers. Seasonal television is an American staple (perhaps less so here in the UK), with even series like the surreal college sitcom <a href="http://www.nbc.com/community/" target="_blank"><em>Community</em></a> playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology_(Community)" target="_blank">quite brilliantly</a> with the zombie genre just a couple of days before.</p>
<p>Halloween also saw the launch of a new, free online podcast magazine and website, showcasing the best in genre short fiction. <a href="http://www.darkfictionmagazine.co.uk/" target="_blank"><em>Dark Fiction Magazine</em></a> is the brainchild of <strong>Sharon Ring</strong> and <strong>Del Lakin-Smith</strong>, two names familiar to the UK genre scene. Their stated aim is to produce a monthly short fiction podcast magazine, featuring at least four short stories in each issue focussed around a distinct theme.</p>
<p>In the spirit of ‘a rising tide lifts all boats’ (thanks for that, Mur!), we spoke to Sharon and Del about their new project and what people can expect.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/DFMScreenshot1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1403" src="http://escapepod.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/DFMScreenshot1.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="368" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Escape Pod: Thanks for joining us! Let’s start with yourselves – wh</strong><strong>at are your respective backgrounds, and what gave you the idea of starting <em>Dark Fiction Magazine</em>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Del</strong>: I have been working in IT for over 15 years in one form or another and have either run or helped out on numerous websites, so I have my feet firmly in the cloud, so to speak. I’m also obsessed with music, audio engineering and genre.</p>
<p>I launched a podcast in February of last year called <a href="http://www.wordpunk.co.uk/" target="_blank"><em>WordPunk</em></a> which covers all sorts of geeky stuff like tech, genre, movies, etc. I had been looking for ways to expand it or cross pollinate with other non-audio based blogs. Sharon ran the idea of <em>Dark Fiction Magazine</em> by me and I was hooked.</p>
<p><strong>Sharon</strong>: I got into book blogging a couple of years ago with<em> <a href="http://darkfictionreview.net/" target="_blank">Dark Fiction Review</a></em>. From there I moved into working as a freelance editor, mostly on horror novels and short stories. <em>Dark Fiction Magazine</em> was an idea I’d had rattling around my head all summer. Turned out, talking to Del, he’d been thinking along the same lines. And that was it: the coolest partnership in podcasting history was born.</p>
<p><strong>What made you want to make <em>Dark Fiction Magazine</em> a podcast instead of a regular, text-based website?</strong></p>
<p>Podcasts have been around since late 1998, but it was not until 2005 that Apple included native support in iTunes, increasing their popularity massively. These days most people will listen to a podcast in some form, be that a BBC iPlayer <em>Listen Again</em>, an audio book or an internet radio station. So to us, this is the perfect growth medium to launch a short fiction site on. There are many text based short story magazines, and a few audio based ones too, but we saw an opportunity in the market to bring a curated monthly magazine offering high quality genre audio fiction to the masses.</p>
<p><strong>How do you see <em>Dark Fiction Magazine</em> </strong><strong>fitting into current landscape of podcasts and free audio fiction? Hugo-winners aside, the UK seems to be lagging a little in the area, with podcasting still dominated by US shows. In particular, free audio fiction in podcast form has been produced Stateside for a long while now – <em>Escape Pod</em> being just one example!</strong></p>
<p>This is a very good question. Both in fandom and publishing, it is a very close knit community. And there are many passionate, selfless people all working together (and apart) to strengthen the community and industry.</p>
<p>When we looked at the current market, we felt that we could add value to the guys and gals already bringing fantastic audio fiction to us. We are UK-centric, certainly, more from circumstance than deliberation, which lets us offer something different and focus more on our audience. We still see ourselves as a global service bringing out stories from authors all over the world.</p>
<p>The liberating thing about being a free service is that the rules of competition and engagement are different. We are not stealing customers from others, as there are more than enough to go round and our service is similar enough to others that any new listener we get is also a potential listener for them. So we are trying to strike that difficult balance of differentiation enough to be intriguing, but not too much where we have nothing to compare ourselves to and align with.</p>
<p><strong>What are your mid- and long-term goals for <em>Dark Fiction Magazine</em>?</strong></p>
<p>To be honest we have been blown away by the positive responses we have had since launch and we are really pleased with how it is going. As for plans going forward, we aim to keep growing our range of stories, authors, narrators and artists while creating a valuable medium for new talent to launch themselves from.</p>
<p>We are also keen to partner with disability charities to ensure their customers get the best access to our free audio stories as possible and we are playing with the idea of expanding the platform into more cutting edge digital experiments. We are all about accessibility, so if there is a way to get great fiction out there, we hope to embrace it.</p>
<p><strong>So, who exactly is <em>Dark Fiction Magazine</em> aimed at? As well as current fiction, will there</strong><strong> be readings of old classics? And are you open to submissions or contributions?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>Dark Fiction Magazine</em> is for absolutely everyone who loves genre fiction. We’re not tied to one genre or sub-genre, so we’re able to podcast lots of content with broad appeal. Our target audience is anyone and everyone. We hope to get sci-fi readers tuning in to horror episodes; fantasy readers listening in to sci-fi. Too often people stick within their own little reading and listening niches. We’re after a wider audience than that. Good genre fiction knows no boundaries, and neither does <em>Dark Fiction Magazine</em>.</p>
<p>We’re interested in submissions from new and established writers but we would ask people to check out our submissions policy first to see whether their material is eligible for submission.</p>
<p>There may be some classic stories read in time. You’ll have to keep an ear out for future episodes to see which of your own favourites make an appearance!</p>

<p><strong>We Are Ted Tuscadero For President</strong><br />
By Chris Dahlen</p>
<p>My name is Ted Tuscadero. And I want to be your President.</p>
<p>I say that with a humble heart. I realize that even after eight stellar years in the Senate, some of you are still getting to know me. And I’ll admit, I am not perfect. The other day, when I told a VFW in Littleton I would blast Iran to glass, and at the same exact time I swore off the war at a town hall in Concord? My bad. Or the time that three of me showed up for the big debate in Manchester, and we got in a fistfight over who was going on the air? Yeah, the chattering classes had a few laughs over that one.</p>
<p>And that little incident before the holidays, when I crashed, as lit as a Christmas tree, into a pole and my car exploded, killing me instantly and taking a mailbox, a transformer and a barn cat with me? It looked bad, I know. But that proxy was on the fritz. That’s not me. That’s not who I am. And the more we talk, the better you get to know me, the more you’ll see what I mean.</p>

<p>#</p>
<p>I am a lucky man. Of the hundred of me that fanned out across New Hampshire for the presidential primary campaign, I landed in Fairport, a cute spot on the coast. My ex-wife would’ve called it “darling.” I didn’t even know New Hampshire <em>had</em> a coast until they drove me here and got me a room, looking over the harbor, the tugboats, the cobblestone streets. The whole place is loaded with money and photo ops.</p>
<p>I like to think it’s payback for a job well done. For the last six months I’ve been shaking hands, holding town halls, and listening to cranky seniors and eager young back-to-the-earthers. I’ve eaten food on a stick that belonged in the trash. I’ve honed my laugh lines and I’ve sold my vision.</p>
<p>The primary’s in January, and my opponent, Billy LaMontagne, has local roots. Three-time governor of neighboring Maine, well known and well liked in the area, LaMontagne doesn’t use proxies: he’s stumping the state all by himself. But he doesn’t need proxies when everyone with four teeth or fewer knows his face and thinks they can trust it. I&#8217;m the insurgent from New Jersey with everything to prove.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the focus groups say about me: “City slicker.” “Promises anything to anyone.” “Will take away our right to bear arms.” That one really gets me &#8211; LaMontagne likes to wave around an assault rifle during deer season to show all the yokels that he likes red meat and Milwaukee’s worst as much as the rest of them. And fine, next to that, I do look slick. It’s called “owning a comb and a necktie,” and I’ve been doing it since Princeton, thanks.</p>
<p>LaMontagne can crack the screen, I’ll grant him that. When this is all over, he should really get his own line of barbeque sauce. But we’re talking about a national election. The guy has a loose mouth and a small mind and if he gets the nomination, the Republicans won’t even run against him: they’ll kick back and watch him destroy himself. So, this race isn’t just about me. It’s my duty as a loyal Democrat to put this guy down.</p>
<p>But back to me. I have two jobs here in Fairport. First and foremost is the usual campaign stuff &#8211; shake a lot of hands, get a lot of money. But I also have a project. I was explaining it to an eighth-grader the other day. She was doing a thing for her school paper &#8211; which has a teeny readership made up of a totally non-voting audience, but hey, any press is good, and I never talk above an eighth-grade level anyway. We sat in the school gym, with old crumbly murals and the outlines of kids painted on the wall, all kind of round and blank &#8211; probably just the same kid painted over and over.  Above it all flew a giant American flag, and I made sure it was in the shot when she took my picture.</p>
<p>“So, um, Senator Tuscadero -” starts the kid.</p>
<p>“Call me Ted,” I say, flashing my brilliant white teeth.</p>
<p>“Um, I’m not sure how to ask this, but &#8211; are you the real Senator Tuscadero, or -”</p>
<p>“I’m a proxy,” I say, smiling again. I never let anyone feel awkward, especially about this. “I’m one of the hundred proxies in New Hampshire, here for the original Ted Tuscadero, who’s down in D.C. doing the work of the people. The proxies are here to give the people of New Hampshire -”</p>
<p><em>The first-in-the-nation primary voters, who can set me up with that sweet, sweet early momentum</em>, I’m thinking -</p>
<p>“ &#8211; A close look at my governing style, my experience, and my vision for a better America.”</p>
<p>“So you’re called a &#8216;proxy.&#8217; Do you ever call yourselves &#8216;clones&#8217;?”</p>
<p>I laugh again gently. “We could, but we prefer the term &#8216;proxy.&#8217;”  (&#8220;Clone&#8221; tested badly.)</p>
<p>Next we get to why I’m in Fairport: my special project, which will show the voters what a doer and a leader I am.</p>
<p>“So Amy, I’d like to tell you what I’m here to do. You may have heard that Fairport would like to build a windmill. A state-of-the-art, clean green energy solution that would cut your bills and make us safe from the bad guys across the sea.”</p>
<p>Amy nods her head up and down and cocks it to the side, like she’d seen somebody do on TV. Maybe Couric.</p>
<p>“That’s on Parakeet Ave,” she says.</p>
<p>“Exactly. That’s the site they chose. And the trouble is, someone else &#8211; a man named Jim McSmit &#8211; bought the land, and he’d like to put a different business there.”</p>
<p>“A bar?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. A bar.”</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the eighth-grader can’t put in her newspaper: the &#8220;restaurant and bar&#8221; would be called Body Shots. It’s a biker-themed titty bar, dropped right here on the snooty seacoast. The neighbors for a mile around are batshit about this, about how it’ll look, who it’ll draw, the growl of barely-ridden Harleys in the parking lot. But the zoning doesn’t prohibit it. Somebody needs to work out a deal. And that’s what I’m here to do.</p>
<p>My campaign aide, Rachael, subtly taps her watch. Time to wrap this up. I answer a couple more questions and shook my little reporter’s hand. We also give her some pins and a pamphlet for her parents. “TOM TUSCADERO: A <em>REAL</em> LEADER FOR AMERICA.”</p>
<p>“Don’t forget to vote!” I wink at her as they whisk me out the door.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>I’m here with two aides. One is my driver &#8211; after the Christmas crash, we all got drivers &#8211; and the other is Rachael, my aide. Also my lover. And by “lover,” I mean, <em>”yeeeeeeeee-haw.”</em> She has a dual degree in poli-sci and psychology, though I’ll be frank, that’s not the first thing I noticed when they assigned her to me. A slender brunette just out of Swarthmore, she&#8217;s an idealist who still believes in the process. She loves politics. She’s smitten with me, too, and she’s also kind of fascinated by me. She’s drawn to my meteoric career &#8211; but also, to my complex personality.</p>
<p>“What have we got today?” I ask.</p>
<p>“The senior citizens&#8217; center at 10, lunch with the chamber of commerce at noon, and dialing-for-dollars in the afternoon.”</p>
<p>I wince. I hate dialing for dollars. I call everyone I’ve known my whole life and ask them for money. It feels crass, plus, sometimes our lists get mixed up. I’ll end up calling my third-grade English teacher and just as I’m about to reminisce, she tells me that another proxy already rang her up with the same “you walked me to the school nurse” memory. It always makes me feel like a phony.</p>
<p>But before all that, we head downtown. I swing by Main Street at least once a day. Grab a latte from the locally owned café dead center downtown. The same apple Danish: fatty I know, but it’s comfort food and oh boy, the way they bake &#8216;em it’s like an angel crying on your tongue. And then I swing by and spar with the guys at the barbershop. I can always count on five or six voters waiting for a cut. This barber is slower than death.</p>
<p>Joe the barber hates me. He’s a Republican from way back. He probably cast his first vote for Lincoln. Every time I set foot in his shop he greets me the same way: “You cost too goddamn much.”</p>
<p>“Hi Joe,” I say, smiling and winking at his peanut gallery. “What’s the good news today?”</p>
<p>“The radio says they want to make more of you, for the general election,” says Joe. “It’s a waste of taxpayer dollars. We have too many politicians crawling around the country as it is.”</p>
<p>“Well, Joe, as you know, making more proxies is cheap money after the first one.” This is true. When they perfected the cloning process, they found an interesting trick: cloning one person costs … well, it’s a state secret how much it costs, so you can guess how much that is. But the first time you do it, you make a kind of a “mold” &#8211; that’s how they explained it to me, anyway &#8211; and from that mold, you can pour as many copies as you want for a few bucks a shot.</p>
<p>“I’m a bargain, Joe. You get to tell me off in person every day!” I wink.</p>
<p>I take a quick glance to see how the other men react. But I notice that most of them are looking out the window at Rachael, who’s standing outside on her phone. It’s freezing, but she always waits outside at the barbershop.</p>
<p>A little more chitchat, one more winning smile and I’m moving on.</p>
<p>I’m starting to think I know this town better than the one where I live. I know where to get the best martini and the freshest lobster roll. I can practically count the votes here by name.</p>
<p>“You know what, Rach? When I’m done with the White House, we should come back here. I would make a really good Mayor.”</p>
<p>“First things first, Senator,” she says, and steers me back to the car.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Back at the hotel, I get out of the shower to see Rachael tapping at her laptop. She snaps it closed as soon as she hears me.</p>
<p>“Bad news in the polls?” I ask, smiling &#8211; not my politician smile, but my real one. Only Rachael gets the real one.</p>
<p>“Yes, but not in yours. I was actually reading about the Republicans. Word is, Governor Kewt just got himself a sex scandal.”</p>
<p>“Hot damn! Was he caught with a dead girl? A live boy? <em>Both</em>?”</p>
<p>“Daughter of a senator &#8211; scratch that, <em>two</em> daughters &#8211; and they let it slip on Twitter. They get a book deal, he’s down for the count.”</p>
<p>That’s it! The Republicans are done! Kewt&#8217;s the only candidate they had this year who could walk down the street without wearing out his knuckles. I feel relief and desire and <em>lust</em>. I have this thing in the <em>bag</em>. I can picture myself … well, um, <em>yeah</em>, myself … walking into the Oval Office and dropping my loafers right on the top of that desk.</p>
<p>She responds to my smile. She loves this game, almost as much as I do. I know what you’re probably thinking: I picked her as my aide because <em>va-vooom</em>. But believe me, I’m lucky to have her. She’s been working on campaigns since junior high. This is her first real gig on a national campaign, and she already acts like a vet. I would be lost without her.</p>
<p>And I’d be lost on nights like this, too. Back in Washington I was out every night and on the phone the minute I got home. I’d call old friends, new colleagues, people I had to cajole, constituents who thought I’d never remember their names. I loved to talk to people. But now that I’m … well, I can’t really do that now. None of us proxies are allowed to make casual calls, and these aren’t “my” friends anymore. It would creep people out.</p>
<p>But Rachael? Rachael is all mine.</p>
<p>“We have to get up in five hours,” she says, pulling me into bed.</p>
<p>“So let’s get three hours of sleep.”</p>
<p>“If you’re lucky I’ll make it one.”</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>And so I’m tired and not in the mood the next morning when my phone rings. It was someone I didn’t want to talk to, and I had to schlep all the way outside to meet him.</p>
<p>I pull on some clothes and go to the street to find Harry Angler idling at the curb, in a rental car, his window halfway down. A doughy guy with a potato-shaped head and a comb-over like bent hay, he had, as always, no facial expression whatsoever. And here he is, getting <em>me</em> up first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>Angler’s the guy who gets stuff done for me in D.C. When I first found him, early in my career, he was just a two-bit election-fixer working for dead-end campaigns. You know the racket &#8211; running push polls to make the other guy sound like Hitler’s lost grandson, or spreading photos of an uptight Christian blitzed at a gay bar. Angler didn’t have much of a resume. But I saw something there I could use, and now he works for me – I mean, the original me, the me in D.C. &#8211; on all of my campaigns.</p>
<p>That also means he’s in charge of the proxies. He swings by to check in on me every couple of weeks. I used to have him on the phone twenty times a day, and now I only get time with him when he feels like showing up.</p>
<p>“Harry, hi,” I say, leaning casually on the window. He just pushes a poll in my hand. “This is confidential from the campaign.”</p>
<p>I skim the pages. “I don’t see any surprises.”</p>
<p>“LaMontagne&#8217;s gaining ground with 50-65 year old divorcees. You have a lot of those here, no?”</p>
<p><em>Could you at least turn off the car so I don’t have to talk over your engine?</em></p>
<p>“Oh sure, I’m working their votes,” I say. “And listen, I also made some headway on the windmill project -”</p>
<p>“That’s good. We have no room for error here. And don’t forget, Windswept Industries needs that thing built, or the money they’re sending us is gone.”</p>
<p>We chitchat a little more, but I can tell he’s eager to move on. <em>Dammit</em>, I think, <em>would you treat me &#8211; the original me &#8211; this way? How would me-in-D.C. act if he saw you act like this?</em></p>
<p>But again, I didn’t say anything. Because hard as it is to admit, I need him.</p>
<p>Sounding casual, I ask: “Listen, so, any movement on the leaderboard?”</p>
<p>“The leaderboard&#8217;s always moving,” he answered.</p>
<p>“So how am I doing?”</p>
<p>“You’ve done great work here,” says Angler. “Great work. And we expect even more.” And that’s all I get out of him before he leaves.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>“Can I ask you a question?” says Joe the barber, a straight razor over my temple.</p>
<p>“Shoot,” I say. I was there, for once, to get an actual haircut, and we had the shop to ourselves. Seeing Angler’s scruffy dome made me want to get my own cleaned up. Have to look my best for all those lonely old women whose votes weren’t in the bag.</p>
<p>“You’re Ted Tuscadero, and there’s Senator Ted Tuscadero down in Washington. And then there are ninety-nine more of you running around.”</p>
<p>“That’s the headcount.” Well, it’s a hundred minus the one we lost on Christmas. And I think Rachael said another one just “dropped out.” I’m not sure what that means-I was eavesdropping.</p>
<p>“So when this election’s over, what do you all do?”</p>
<p>“Well, during the election as you know, I’ll be traveling the country for the campaign. After that? We’ll still represent the President, and push his agenda. You remember when people joked that President Obama was -everywhere- whenever he had something to push. I can really do it.”</p>
<p>“So you stay on the road, while the first Senator goes to the White House?”</p>
<p>I know I shouldn’t tell him. But I can’t resist.</p>
<p>“Here’s the thing,” I say, lowering my tone. “We have something called the -leaderboard.- It’s how we rank all the proxies.”</p>
<p>Joe is shaving me now, getting things oh-so-smooth around my ear.</p>
<p>“The way it works, when you help the campaign, you move up. If you screw up, you move down. The proxies near the top get the choice assignments. And when the election’s over, the top one gets &#8211; well, I shouldn’t say.”</p>
<p>“Let me guess. You get some time in the White House?”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” I answer. “The original Ted can take long vacations while I stay in Washington. I get to share power with myself.”</p>
<p>Joe thinks it over, but he doesn’t seem convinced. “I dunno. He’s you. You’re him. Would you give up the top seat? For even one single day?”</p>
<p>He catches me for a second. But I shoot him an easy smile and say, “Well, I do like my vacations.”</p>
<p>Joe laughs. Score.</p>
<p>“I know you think you’re doing us voters a favor. But the thing is, people don’t like politicians,” says Joe. “We only like &#8216;em at their funerals.”</p>
<p>“I care about the windmill. And I care about this town. You see me every day!”</p>
<p>“Ted, if you lived here, I’d hate you year-round!”</p>
<p>“Maybe you just don’t know me well enough,” I grin.</p>
<p>On my way out the door, my cell phone rings. I have to take this call: it’s none other than Jim McSmit, the guy whose nudie bar stands between me and the White House. He suggests we meet for lunch. Rachael had been working for days to set this up, and now he calls me, and names the restaurant. It’s not the one I would’ve picked &#8211; but only because I’m not a member. Yet.</p>
<p>McSmit meets me at the 10 Congress Club. It’s a swank new social club, with a membership fee in the thousands and a line of old and new money waiting to pay. McSmit, shall we say, is “new money.” One look at the guy and you hid your wallet. Beady eyes squinted between a smooth-shaved dome and a bushy handlebar moustache, and his leather jacket was filthy. First thing he warned me: “Don’t swear in here. They’ll fucking fine you.”</p>
<p>My goal here was to see if we could settle this at a cost the city council could swallow. And it wasn’t starting well. We started off on his turf, on his clock, and he knew that he had what I needed.</p>
<p>“Here’s my thing,” he says. “I’m just a guy making a living on beer, tits and wings. Not a Washington big shot like you.”</p>
<p>“Hey, I think I know a little more about your situation than you’d think,” I correct him. “I ran a small business myself.”</p>
<p>“Yeah? What was that?”</p>
<p>“My law practice.”</p>
<p>McSmit scoffs, at that but I ignore him. “I was a trial lawyer. Win a case, and you’re rich; lose, and you just wasted a year on nothing. I know what American businessmen put on the line.”</p>
<p>“What I’ve heard, you won plenty of cases. Did pretty well for yourself. Why’d you even get into politics? What do they pay you in the Senate?”</p>
<p>“It’s not really about the pay,” I say, realizing no one ever really asks me about this. “I love it for the same reason I love a trial. I love going into a court and <em>persuading</em> people &#8211; because that’s half the battle, not just having the facts and the evidence, but convincing them you’re their guy. I’m good at that. Put me in front of anyone, face to face, and I can get them to hear me out. And when they do, they usually agree with me.”</p>
<p>McSmit cuts me off. “Don’t count on getting any agreement from me. Seems you just came here to tell me to get out of town. And nobody tells me that. Ever.”</p>
<p>Tough talk. But I’ve heard tougher.  “Okay. Then what <em>should</em> I tell you?”</p>
<p>“What’ll you give me if I nix the restaurant?”</p>
<p>I laugh. “I’m not writing you a check, if that’s what you’re getting at. Election officials take offense at that kind of thing.”</p>
<p>“I’m not fucking slow, I know you can’t just -give- me something. But even if you lose the race, you’re a fucking Senator. A favor from you could be worth something. And anyway, LaMontagne&#8217;s people have been dragging their dicks in the sand about what <em>they&#8217;ll</em> do for me.”</p>
<p>This surprises me. “You’re saying LaMontagne&#8217;s backing you up on this?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah, I talk to some of his people. He doesn’t talk to me directly, like you. There aren’t as many of him, so his time’s worth a lot more.” His grin went halfway to a snarl.</p>
<p>“LaMontagne will never make it to the White House. If I win here, I win the White House. And I will remember the people who helped me along the way.”</p>
<p>McSmit goes silent. He swirls his drink around. “Well, that’s fucking sweet, but what can you do for me down there? LaMontagne&#8217;s right over in Maine. Lots of girls in Maine want to work for a Body Shots, ‘specially in this economy. Lots of local talent up there. You know they have a topless donut shop up near the capital?”</p>
<p>“So I guess you’re saying you don’t want me to go to Washington and save the economy,” I joke. That gets a genuine laugh out of him, and for a second there, I don’t want to kill the guy.</p>
<p>But by the time the tab comes, I know we’re done here. And he hammers it in as he reaches for the tab and looks at the fines that the maitre d- was quietly ticking up every time he opened his stupid mouth.</p>
<p>“Sorry I can’t help you. But hey, I’m the one who spent $240 to tell you what’s on my mind.”</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>“What’s plan B?” Rachael asks back at the hotel, where I don’t even feel like sex.</p>
<p>I sigh. “We can try to seize the lot through eminent domain, but that’s a scorched earth approach. It’s bound to tick off voters left, right, and center.” I groan. “Maybe I can find another buyer for the land.”</p>
<p>“But LaMontagne will find a way to block you,” she says. And that stings. Here’s LaMontagne, playing his pawns against me while he won’t even stoop to sit at the chessboard.</p>
<p>“When I get into office, I’m going to move so much nuclear waste to his state that that fucker won’t need lights on the highway.”</p>
<p>“I love it when you talk all tough,” Rachael laughs. She walks into the other room to pour a couple of drinks.</p>
<p>Her laptop is open, and I glance over and see a poll on her screen. I’ve never seen this one before. It isn’t a poll of the primary, or the likely nominees. It isn’t an issues poll, either. It’s a poll I’ve never seen before &#8211; a poll about proxies.</p>
<p>“Do you support the use of proxies to reach out to voters?” asked the first question. 63% said yes. Okay, that’s nice. The voters still like the personal touch.</p>
<p>“Recently, the federal government revealed the true price of the program. Do you think it’s worth the expense?” Hey, that was news &#8211; I didn’t realize the cost had leaked. Doesn’t anyone know how to keep a state secret anymore? And here, the numbers look bad: 3% thought it was worth the money, 2% were not sure. Everyone else was totally pissed off.</p>
<p>Well, okay, people hate it when you spend their money. But come on, we can spin this. I just catch the next question, which looked like it had something to do with my car crash last December. “Given the controversy over the cost, the ethical issues, and the public safety risks, do you believe the proxy program should-”</p>
<p>And then I hear Rachael padding back into the bedroom. Skilled from years of surfing porn at the office, I flick the window back in time and slide away from the computer.</p>
<p>“What’s up?” she asks.</p>
<p>“Planning my next move on the Body Shots situation.” With a heavy sigh I say, “This is going to get ugly. Rach, I’m going to need to talk to Harry Angler tomorrow. Can you get me on the phone with him?”</p>
<p>The minute the name leaves my lips, I know I’ve screwed up.</p>
<p>See, Rachael’s an idealist. A world saver. She used to spend spring break walking girls past the mobs at abortion clinics. She hears me bring up Angler’s name, and she know exactly what I have in mind.</p>
<p>“You don’t have any other ideas?”</p>
<p>“Nope. None. I can’t do this the right way. But I can still get it done.”</p>
<p>Her eyes get hard &#8211; she’s giving me idealist eyes. “You know I joined this campaign because I know you can be a good man. That’s what matters to me. You’re here to do right, and this isn’t right.”</p>
<p>“Rachael, sometimes the ends justify the -”</p>
<p>She cuts that off with a wave of her hand. “Don’t bullshit me.”</p>
<p>So I speak to her as honestly as I know how. “I don’t have a choice here, Rach. I really don’t have a choice. If I slip on the leaderboard, if I don’t deliver this town &#8211; I’m finished. Just finished. You think I don’t know have my own questions about how this thing works? Do you think I really believe that the bottom ten guys are getting ambassadorships?</p>
<p>“And,” I added after a thought, “Regardless. I didn’t come this far to give up. That’s not who I am.”</p>
<p>We don’t talk the rest of that night. The last time I see her is when she drops my blanket and pillow on the couch. But I can handle that. Give it time, and she’ll see my point of view.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>The next week was very convenient for me.</p>
<p>McSmit made the papers: while driving back from a meeting to look at plans for an ice luge, McSmit started driving erratically. He totaled his Mustang on the lawn of a historic house, pulverizing a 17th century birdbath. And what should the cops find in the glove compartment but a tiny bag with a few snorts of cocaine. The legal bill will be staggering. Selling the lot for Body Shots is a given.</p>
<p>By the time of the primary, we had a deal. The Council voted for it; the windmill company gave them a special price for a pilot program. Even Rachael started to warm back up to me. She isn’t happy about McSmit &#8211; no mistaking that &#8211; but hey, green energy is one of her issues. Technically, this is a win.</p>
<p>I won the primary, too. The state was close, but I had a landslide margin in Fairport. And I made the top of the proxy leaderboard. I should’ve been over the moon.</p>
<p>But somehow I don’t feel finished with this place. In fact, to tell the truth? It feels like the town is finished with me.</p>
<p>On primary night, I stood outside the polling place at the middle school, shaking hands at the gym. On the way in, everyone shook my hand and promised to give me their vote. And on the way out, they kept saying goodbye &#8211; like they were never going to see me again.</p>
<p>My campaign party felt like a wake. At the Mayor came, and he gave me a beefy handshake. “Ted, we’re really pleased about this project,” he says. “And hey, I know you’ll be busy in the White House next spring. But is there any way you could come back for the groundbreaking? It’s your baby, and we’d love to take your photo with it.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t miss it,” I say, smiling. “But listen. In case I’m busy. Could we take the photo with -” I didn’t know how to put this. “Like, could you take a picture of me for this?”</p>
<p>“Ted, we haven’t even broken ground yet -”</p>
<p>I blurt it out. “If I come back this fall, well &#8211; I don’t know if it’ll be me. <em>Me</em> me. You know?”</p>
<p>The Mayor suddenly got my meaning. He stopped, and we had an awkward moment. But it was just a moment. He’s a pol, and he knows how to come right back to the comfort zone. With a cough and a smile, he claps me on the back and says, “Ted? It’ll be you and me and the Secret Service and all your friends in Fairport. And we will welcome you back.”</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>My last day in Fairport, I decide to get my hair cut.</p>
<p>Naturally I go to Joe’s. I wanted to say goodbye, and rib him a little for not voting for me. Rachael said she’d meet me here as soon as the cars packed, and then we’re off to D.C. for our next assignment.</p>
<p>“Ted, I didn’t vote for you, that’s true. You’re on the wrong ticket,” says Joe. “But I’ve gotta say, you lived up to your word. You said you’d build that ridiculous windmill and saddle us all with debt, and you did it.”</p>
<p>“It’ll save money in the long run,” I remind him as he changed clippers.</p>
<p>“Remains to be seen.”</p>
<p>“I’ll come back and find out,” I smile. Damn was I feeling home sick already, and we hadn’t even pulled out of town.</p>
<p>Joe is silent for a while. “So, what’s next for you?” he asks, and he sounds a little funny.</p>
<p>“They haven’t told me. But I have a feeling it’s gonna be great,” I say.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m curious what’s next. Just because the election’s in the bag doesn’t mean we can stop working. Maybe they’ll send me to California – the big prize. I love the weather. And one of me isn’t enough for a state that big. Maybe I’ll get more proxies, working under me – a hundred of them canvassing the state, and I would coordinate them all. In fact, I wonder if I can give each of them a Rachael.</p>
<p>I look out the window to see if Rachael’s brought the car. And then I spot something: a van pulls up outside, and a man in a rumbled trench coat slouches out. It’s Angler.</p>
<p>“What’s in the paper,” I ask, “any good news?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Nah. Nothing you should worry about. You just won big, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>Angler walks in, and I get a feeling in my gut &#8211; the feeling I get when I’m about to be ambushed by a reporter, or sunk in a debate, or just when I shouldn’t take a call. I get a feeling that I should excuse myself. But there’s nowhere to go.</p>
<p>“Senator,” he says, “come with me.”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute. His haircut’s not done,” Joe objects. He puts a hand on my shoulder. Angler doesn’t even look at him.</p>
<p>“Time to go, Senator.”</p>
<p>I nod to Joe and stand. I offer to pay, but Joe shakes his head. “On the house.”</p>
<p>“Well, thanks Joe. I really appreciate that.”</p>
<p>And for the first time, he extends his hand. We shake. “Best of luck to you, Senator,” he says. And as I leave the shop and get in the van, I feel good. I could swear I almost have his vote.</p>

We Are Ted Tuscadero For President
By Chris Dahlen

My name is Ted Tuscadero. And I want to be your President.

I say that with a humble heart. I realize that even after eight stellar years in the Senate, some of you are still getting to know me. And Irsquo;ll admit, I am not perfect. The other day, when I told a VFW in Littleton I would blast Iran to glass, and at the same exact time I swore off the war at a town hall in Concord? My bad. Or the time that three of me showed up for the big debate in Manchester, and we got in a fistfight over who was going on the air? Yeah, the chattering classes had a few laughs over that one.

And that little incident before the holidays, when I crashed, as lit as a Christmas tree, into a pole and my car exploded, killing me instantly and taking a mailbox, a transformer and a barn cat with me? It looked bad, I know. But that proxy was on the fritz. Thatrsquo;s not me. Thatrsquo;s not who I am. And the more we talk, the better you get to know me, the more yoursquo;ll see what I mean.

Keep reading...


#

I am a lucky man. Of the hundred of me that fanned out across New Hampshire for the presidential primary campaign, I landed in Fairport, a cute spot on the coast. My ex-wife wouldrsquo;ve called it ldquo;darling.rdquo; I didnrsquo;t even know New Hampshire had a coast until they drove me here and got me a room, looking over the harbor, the tugboats, the cobblestone streets. The whole place is loaded with money and photo ops.

I like to think itrsquo;s payback for a job well done. For the last six months Irsquo;ve been shaking hands, holding town halls, and listening to cranky seniors and eager young back-to-the-earthers. Irsquo;ve eaten food on a stick that belonged in the trash. Irsquo;ve honed my laugh lines and Irsquo;ve sold my vision.

The primaryrsquo;s in January, and my opponent, Billy LaMontagne, has local roots. Three-time governor of neighboring Maine, well known and well liked in the area, LaMontagne doesnrsquo;t use proxies: hersquo;s stumping the state all by himself. But he doesnrsquo;t need proxies when everyone with four teeth or fewer knows his face and thinks they can trust it. I'm the insurgent from New Jersey with everything to prove.

Here's what the focus groups say about me: ldquo;City slicker.rdquo; ldquo;Promises anything to anyone.rdquo; ldquo;Will take away our right to bear arms.rdquo; That one really gets me - LaMontagne likes to wave around an assault rifle during deer season to show all the yokels that he likes red meat and Milwaukeersquo;s worst as much as the rest of them. And fine, next to that, I do look slick. Itrsquo;s called ldquo;owning a comb and a necktie,rdquo; and Irsquo;ve been doing it since Princeton, thanks.

LaMontagne can crack the screen, Irsquo;ll grant him that. When this is all over, he should really get his own line of barbeque sauce. But wersquo;re talking about a national election. The guy has a loose mouth and a small mind and if he gets the nomination, the Republicans wonrsquo;t even run against him: theyrsquo;ll kick back and watch him destroy himself. So, this race isnrsquo;t just about me. Itrsquo;s my duty as a loyal Democrat to put this guy down.

But back to me. I have two jobs here in Fairport. First and foremost is the usual campaign stuff - shake a lot of hands, get a lot of money. But I also have a project. I was explaining it to an eighth-grader the other day. She was doing a thing for her school paper - which has a teeny readership made up of a totally no...</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a writer and consumer of genre fiction, now should be the perfect time of year for me, right? After all, Halloween is just around the corner<a href="#jr_halloween_1">*</a><em> [Ed note: Mur was very bad in getting this up, so consider Halloween having just passed us by...] </em>and every sci-fi blog, podcast, and show is extolling the virtues of Halloween.</p>
<p>To me, though, Halloween&#8230; just doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>Now, maybe when my daughter is a little older and she starts going door-to-door asking for donations of unhealthy food<a href="#jr_halloween_2">**</a> while wearing an amusing costume, I might care a little more. I might also care more if more trick-or-treaters came to my door, but I think we get an average of five per year. I&#8217;ve taken to putting out a bowl and being done with the matter.</p>
<p>Halloween holds no special place in my heart. Which is weird, because I write some pretty dark, disturbing fiction when the mood strikes. But I don&#8217;t care about costumes, decorations, scary movies being more relevant now than in February or June, candy (except Nerds Rope, which is awesome), or parties. I don&#8217;t dress up (I might wear a funny wig to work), I don&#8217;t gorge myself on sweets, I don&#8217;t watch <i>The Ring</i> or listen to a reading of &#8220;The Cask of Amontillado&#8221;. This year I&#8217;ll probably be asleep before the trick-or-treaters even arrive because I have to be at work before 6am the next day.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just being old and crotchety. I&#8217;ve never crocheted in my life. In college, I didn&#8217;t make it a point to go to Halloween parties. When I was a kid, I trick-or-treated, but I wasn&#8217;t one of those who kept it up as a teenager. I stopped dressing up at about age 11, and that was that. </p>
<p>I just don&#8217;t see the point of making such a big deal out of a holiday that you don&#8217;t even get off of work or school. Maybe that makes me weird, or an outcast in the community, but I can&#8217;t be the <i>only</i> genre person who doesn&#8217;t care that October 31 is supposed to mean candy, costumes, parties, and scary media &#8212; I think we were all really sick of <i>ER</i>&#8216;s Halloween episodes after a couple of seasons.</p>
<p>These days, sadly, Halloween exists to sell stuff, and so the media can trot out their &#8220;razor blade in the candy&#8221; and &#8220;check over your kid&#8217;s trick-or-treat bag&#8221; stories that they&#8217;ve been brushing off for the past few decades. Good space fillers. Good ways to sell things people don&#8217;t really need to eat. Good for kids (unless their parents object to the holiday, which kind of makes &#8220;write your favorite Halloween memory in your writing journal today&#8221; assignments pretty hard).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry. I don&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p>Go and have your fun this Halloween. Enjoy your movies, and your candy, and your parties, and dressing up like Sexy Elmo, or Sexy Avatar Blue Person, or Sexy Chilean Miner&#8217;s Wife, or just your average angel or devil. Spend your money, consume your media, enjoy the hell out of it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be sleeping.</p>
<p><a name="jr_halloween_1">*</a> <i>Or, at least, it was when I wrote this. I&#8217;ve been woefully delinquent lately.</i></p>
<p><a name="jr_halloween_2">**</a> <i>Come to think of it, most canned food collected in food drives is absurdly high in sodium, which isn&#8217;t good for you either.</i></p>

<p><strong>Saint Darwin’s Spirituals</strong><br />
By D.K. Thompson</p>
<p>The ghosts wanted a threesome – the two of them in Lucy’s body. It wasn’t an unheard of proposition, or so Lucy had been told. Prostitutes considered psychic whoring one of the safest tricks on the streets. All the pleasures of intimacy without the messy clean-up.</p>
<p>Ghosts had a nasty reputation for vanishing the moment after, though, no matter the talisman around your neck or the potion drunk before sunset, and so payments were usually collected up front. Not that Lucy was worried about the money. Her husband was the only thing that concerned her.</p>
<p>She adjusted her brass and leather goggles, peering through the ethereal tinted lenses to examine the ghosts.</p>
<p>They looked like the average apparitions. Both female. One spiraled around Lucy, long and curly hair obscuring her face. Large black blotches covered her body, causing her skin to peel off in patches. The other hovered several feet above the cobblestones in front of Lucy. She had a noose around her throat and her neck was bent so her head hung to the left side. She crossed her arms and took several breaths. Or whatever passed for breaths in the afterlife.<br />
<em><br />
How long had it been since they’d felt someone’s touch? </em>Lucy wondered. She remembered something her husband had told her long ago, before the murders, before he’d disappeared. “Spirits linger in this world longing to be a part of it, to reconnect, to have some kind of physical, sensual experience,” Thomas had said. “Only a host can provide them that.”</p>
<p><em>Ghosts aren’t the only creatures haunted by the memory of a touch, my love,</em> Lucy thought. And yet, despite being a devout spiritualist, she shuddered at the idea of the cadaverous spirits making love inside her. She’d never had a ghostgasm before, much less been paid for one. The ghosts looked sincere in their desire, not like dangerous murderers. Certainly not monsters. Still, lonely as she was, a ghostgasm wouldn’t help her find Thomas.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/2010/10/28/ep264-st-darwins-spirituals/">Read more&#8230;.</a></p>
<p><span id="more-1336"></span></p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s a good idea, Rose,” said the ghost spinning around Lucy. The air trailing behind her churned like water in a boat’s wake.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, love?” Rose asked, winding the noose’s end around her wrist. “She look a bit too practiced for your tastes, Ethel?”</p>
<p>Lucy felt her cheeks flush. She pulled her shawl over her shoulders and took several small breaths, all her tight corset allowed. “To be honest, I don’t service the dead.” It sounded so insulting, but she couldn’t tell them the truth.</p>
<p>Ethel came to a halt an arm’s-length from Lucy’s face. “I’ve never heard of a whore who had much use for honesty.”</p>
<p>“A whore’s a whore,” said Rose. “We need a rental and our money’s honest, if nothing else is.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” Lucy said. “I meant no offense. But you should find someone else. I’m not quite ready for that kind of…spiritual<br />
experience.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Ethel. “We’ll just have to find a more enlightened whore, then.”</p>
<p>Before Lucy could respond, Ethel turned and shot down the street, passing through a carriage, and eliciting a curse from the coachman as his horses bucked and whinnied.</p>
<p>“You might as well have walked over her grave,” said Rose, fingers clenching the frayed rope. “Sorry we wasted your time.”</p>
<p>“I <em>am</em> sorry,” Lucy sighed. “But I’m really not the one you want to make love to.”</p>
<p>“Too true. I don’t think she fancied the thought of using you, anyway,” said Rose. “Listen, you seem like a nice girl. Why don’t you look me up in Westminster some time? After you’re dead, of course.”</p>
<p>“I’ll consider it,” Lucy said politely, trying not to stare at the noose. “Although I don’t think you’re my type.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you never know, love. Death can be very liberating,” Rose said with a wink. “But I’d rather you live a long life before becoming familiar with it. Best get off the streets. It’s getting late and it’s a nasty night. I don’t want to see you ‘round my area in the near future.” The ghost zoomed off in the direction Ethel had gone, the air shimmering behind her.</p>
<p>Lucy glanced down the dark, empty cobblestone streets. The carriage Ethel had flown through started moving again, clattering hooves echoing in the night air. She flipped out her pocket watch and eyed the time. Still early.</p>
<p>No one else propositioned Lucy for the next half-hour as she wandered Whitechapel, which suited her just fine. There were several prostitutes working, some stood alone under the hissing gas-lit street lamps, others talked with prospective clients, and one Lucy saw contorting on the alleyway floor in the thralls of a ghostgasm. Through the dark glass of her goggles, she could see the spirits twisting inside the prostitute, making love as the host writhed and moaned on the ground. The prostitute’s goggles magnified her blank stare. Had Ethel and Rose found an acceptable host?</p>
<p>Lucy peeled off her goggles. Everything looked the same as it had before, except she could no longer see the ghosts, just the squirming prostitute who looked like she was having a seizure. Lucy quickened her pace, her footfalls drowning out the groans behind her. She rounded the corner and bumped into a golem deputy, its solid clay frame knocking her off balance. It glanced at her, yellow eyes dancing from the flames lit inside his mouth, then continued to trudge down the street.</p>
<p>When the church bells struck midnight, Lucy sat on a bench, kicked off her shoes to rub her feet, and stared at the statue of Saint Charles Darwin in the center of the courtyard. His trademark invention, a pair of goggles, covered his eyes. He sat in his chair and seemed to look down at her, clutching his _Origin of the Species_ essay in one hand and his _Origin of the Spirits_ in the other, as if pondering their implications.</p>
<p><em>Don’t look at me like that,</em> she thought. <em>Sometimes I wish you hadn’t invented these damned things. Sometimes I feel so small and insignificant when I see through your lenses.</em></p>
<p>The bells finished ringing with a hollow sound. Lucy twisted her goggles in her hands and thought about how alone she was, how alone they all seemed to be. She wondered what had happened to Thomas.</p>
<p>It stayed quiet and dark for a long time. Finally, Lucy began toward home. She considered a different route to avoid the prostitute but decided her business must have surely concluded.</p>
<p>No moans echoed from the same alley so Lucy glanced down it. She stopped at what she saw, rooted to the ground.</p>
<p>The prostitute floated in the air, shuddering. The front of her emerald corset wet. The woman’s empty gaze stared past Lucy. Her goggles had shattered on the cobblestones.</p>
<p>Lucy tried to steady her breathing and pulled her goggles back on, looking for a sign of the ghost clients.</p>
<p>Something flickered inside the prostitute’s body. Her eyes and nostrils and mouth seemed to glow. Transfixed, Lucy continued to stare. She’d never seen anything like this before.</p>
<p>High-pitched clattering filled the alley, like the blades of hundreds of knives screeching across metal plates. Then a pair of tentacles jutted through the woman’s chest, splitting it open and streaking her clothes with blood and gore and that same pale, flickering light.</p>
<p>Lucy staggered backwards, covered her mouth with her hands, and looked up. A dark shape hung above the prostitute, perched on a windowsill, wrapping its tentacles around the dead girl’s body.</p>
<p><em>The monster,</em> Lucy thought. <em>Jesus God, at last.</em> She’d played this scene out over and over in her imagination since Thomas had disappeared. But watching it splatter blood and entrails across the alley, Lucy went cold. She took a deep breath, lifted her dress, and unstrapped the single-chamber pistol from her thigh. Swallowed. Tried to steady her trembling, sweating hand.</p>
<p>Light pulsed inside the prostitute. Tentacles dug inside her. Then a sick, wet sound of something being pulped, and a shimmering form was yanked out. A woman. A moaning, eviscerated woman, clutching her wounds.</p>
<p>Lucy caught her breath, said a prayer for the prostitute’s spirit, then fired.</p>
<p>In the flare of the shot, the creature’s body was illuminated, a thorax, covered with hundreds of gleaming mouths. Not a rogue vampire, as the papers had speculated. At least not like any Lucy had seen. Then what the devil <em>was</em> it?</p>
<p>The creature shrieked, so loud, Lucy almost dropped her pistol to cover her ears. The prostitute’s body fell headfirst to the ground, her skull cracking open across the pavement, dashing blood and bits of brain over Lucy.</p>
<p>She took a step back and pulled another round from her pocket. The bullet slipped through her fingers and slid between the cobblestones. She reached for another. Slid it into the chamber and shoved it closed. Aimed.</p>
<p>Too late.</p>
<p>The monster had vanished into the night. Lucy panted and knelt beside the dead prostitute, looked for her spirit. Nothing.</p>
<p>She covered her face with her hands, panting and blinking back tears. She’d seen it. She’d come so close. And she’d let it escape.</p>
<p>Bells sounded in the distance, higher-pitched than the church’s. The Paranormal Patrol.</p>
<p>Lucy wiped her palms on her dress, drying the sweat.</p>
<p>The patrol rounded the corner, bells ringing fast and loud. A pair of golems trotted beside the carriage, their dull gleaming eyes surveying the street. They hadn’t seen her, not yet. Lucy sprang to her feet and into the alley.</p>
<p>A shrill whistle sounded and heavy footsteps pounded behind her – the golems, picking up speed. The lenses of her goggles fogged. She pulled them down where they bounced against her neck as she ran, pistol clutched in hand. She wouldn’t kill a human constable, she’d rather turn herself in and face the consequences. But she had no qualms shooting a golem. They weren’t alive to begin with.</p>
<p>Steam poured from ventilation shafts on the walls, blinding her. More than once, she glanced up at the rooftops, hoping to get a trace of the creature.</p>
<p>A golem lurched out at her through the steam curtain, arms opened wide. She bounced off its chest and hit the ground.</p>
<p>The constable picked her up, its massive grey arms damp and sweating from the heat, and flung her against the brick wall. She landed in a puddle that smelled of piss and vomit, bits of clay sticking to her skin and clothes where the golem had touched her. Lucy rolled to her side, leveled her pistol at the golem and fired. Clay exploded around its chest and the golem flinched from the force of the shot, but its eyes maintained that yellow gleam as it lumbered toward her.</p>
<p>She reached for another bullet. The golem stretched out its giant, wet hands toward her.</p>
<p>“That’s enough!” shouted someone above her. “Stand down, constable!”</p>
<p>The golem froze. Lucy fell back against the wall, tugged her goggles back on to see a pair of spirits descend through the night air toward them.</p>
<p>“Police!” shouted one of the ghosts. “Stay where you are!”</p>
<p>Lucy caught her breath as Ethel and Rose descended beside her, feet hovering over the ground, both of them frowning.</p>
<p>Rose crossed her arms. “You again?”</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>“You two are police?” Lucy asked. “But you solicited me! You wanted to have sex with me!”</p>
<p>“Not with you, with each other,” Rose said. “You were just a warm body.”</p>
<p>“We’re paranormal officers,” Ethel explained. “We’ve been trying to find this monster before it killed again.”</p>
<p>Lucy blinked. She hadn’t heard of any police involvement.</p>
<p>“And instead of it, we found you, assaulting an officer of the law,” said Rose. “Right after fleeing a murder scene. What’s a whore like you doing walking the streets this late with a pistol?”</p>
<p>“Working,” Lucy said. “It’s become something of a dangerous profession.”</p>
<p>“Come off it,” Rose said. “You’re no prostitute. What are you doing dressed like one? Don’t you realize something’s out there killing girls?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Yes, I do.”</p>
<p>“What are you?” Ethel asked. “A nutter? A vigilante?”</p>
<p>She looked down at her clothes and the pistol in her hand, biting her lip. The ghosts and the golem continued to watch her, but she didn’t know how to answer them. What <em>was</em> she doing? Was she any closer to finding out what happened to Thomas?</p>
<p>Lucy closed her eyes, took a breath, then spoke through gritted teeth. “I’m a widow and a spiritualist. That’s all you need to know. Now, get out of my way.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid that won’t do,” said Rose. “We’re short on time. If you won’t provide us with answers, we’ll have to find other ways of asking our questions.” And before Lucy could mutter any incantations or use a talisman against her, Rose dove into her body.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Lucy staggered, saw images from her past being splayed out and dissected in her mind’s eye, felt Rose’s thin, transparent fingers smudging her thoughts and memories, sifting through anything that looked significant to her.</p>
<p>Thomas was there. Telling her about the reports he’d received: prostitutes whose deaths didn’t concern the police. He took the matter into his own hands, like a good spiritualist, hoping to learn about and document this new creature, hoping to save lives by understanding it. He started spending nights on the streets, armed with goggles, talismans, enchantments, and a pistol. He questioned prostitutes and their pimps, tried to figure out what was killing the girls and why.</p>
<p>Lucy saw herself sitting in the kitchen, waiting for him to return. He’d walk in the door, dark circles sagging under his eyes, and talk for hours about the monster roaming the streets. How it stayed in the shadows, eviscerated its victims in a mess of blood and pulp, their ghosts never appearing.</p>
<p>He was out every night in the company of prostitutes. They argued. So often, so long, and hard, they eventually stopped talking. Thomas went days between coming home.</p>
<p>Then, after a week-long absence, Lucy realized he wasn’t coming home.</p>
<p>Rose trampled through it all, clouding Lucy’s memories. Every moment with Thomas, every argument they had, every time they made love. In that lifetime of seconds, Thomas seemed closer than ever, and yet Rose hovered above every instance, staring. Prying.</p>
<p>Lucy wanted to scream.</p>
<p>They stood in the alley watching the prostitute’s ghostgasm (<em>Do I look like that now?</em> Lucy wondered), saw her dead eyes as she floated. Tentacles tearing her open. Blood and gore. A gunshot.</p>
<p>When Rose vanished, a cold emptiness filled Lucy, leaving her alone with memories that didn’t feel like her own anymore. Hollow and violated, a stranger in her own skin.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>She opened her eyes and fell to the ground, gagging.</p>
<p>Ethel was shouting about abuse and the law. Lucy pulled one of Thomas’s talismans from around her neck.</p>
<p>“Sweet Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,” Rose told Ethel. “She saw it. She saw the thing.”</p>
<p>“What?” Ethel asked, rounding on her, just as Lucy slammed her fist through Rose’s incorporeal body.</p>
<p>Rose shrieked in pain, flickering in and out of existence. She spun out of control into the night sky.</p>
<p>“You bitch!” Lucy screamed. “You had no right! If you weren’t dead, I’d kill you myself!”</p>
<p>Ethel phased against Lucy, slammed her back onto the ground. “Where’d you get a grounder?”</p>
<p>“Ask your friend.” Lucy replied. “My husband was a spiritualist. He taught me a thing or two before that monster got him.”</p>
<p>Ethel’s eyes widened. “Your husband? But that’s – that’s impossible. All the victims have been women.”</p>
<p>“Don’t argue with her, Ethel,” Rose said. She still flickered, although it came more sporadically. She narrowed her eyes at Lucy. “Not now. We need to get up to the roof. That’s where it disappeared to. We’ll deal with her later. The constable will watch her.”</p>
<p>The golem stepped forward.</p>
<p>“I’m going with you,” Lucy said.</p>
<p>“No,” Ethel said. “You’ll only slow us down.”</p>
<p>And without another word, the two ghosts shot upward, disappearing into the wall.</p>
<p>Lucy sighed, stuffed her hands into her pockets, and watched the golem.</p>
<p>Something cried out above them. Lucy glanced up, saw a spirit twisting in the air, entrails spilling out of her.</p>
<p>The dead prostitute.</p>
<p>A window shattered behind the spirit, punctured by a tentacle. The appendage pierced the ghost, hooked her like a fish on a line, and then reeled the screaming, writing spirit back into the building.</p>
<p>“Do something!” Lucy shouted. The golem didn’t respond, just stared at her with a blank, flickering expression.</p>
<p>“Dammit!” Lucy shoved another round into the pistol’s chamber and fired point-black at the golem’s face. It stumbled backward, clay spraying the wall behind it. Without waiting to see if the fire went out of its mouth, Lucy turned and dashed into the building, reloading her pistol.</p>
<p>Halfway up the stairs, she found the creature in an empty, bedroom reeking of mildew and rotten meat, yellow paper peeling from the walls. It was a bloated, misshapen abomination sprouting claws and tentacles, covered by hundreds of cavernous mouths filled with teeth like straight razors.</p>
<p>Lucy staggered back, hiding behind the wall. <em>Hail Mary full of grace,</em> she thought. <em>What is it?</em></p>
<p>The chattering sound echoed in the room. The mouths, Lucy realized.</p>
<p>A tentacle burst through the wall, showering Lucy with cement shards and powdering her dress with pale dust. The tentacle coiled around Lucy’s waist, smashing her against the wall.</p>
<p>It dragged her into the room. Lucy gripped her pistol, dragging her heels against the floorboards.</p>
<p>“My name’s Lucy Stone. You’re acquainted with my husband,” she said, the practiced speech coming easy despite her terror.</p>
<p>The creature paused at her voice. Hissed.</p>
<p>“I will be your undoing.” Lucy pushed her pistol against the tentacle that held her and fired.</p>
<p>The creature roared, dropping her. Black phlegm spurted from the wounded tentacle. It whipped through the air, smashing her to the floor.</p>
<p>Other tentacles lashed out in a blur, knocking the pistol off the stairs, coiling around Lucy’s neck. Her skin burned where it touched her. In the distance, she heard a thumping sound. <em>Just my pulse,</em> she thought.</p>
<p>It slammed her back into the hallway, against the banister. Wood splintered and cut into her back. She kicked again, managed to look down. Saw the ground several stories below. The creature pulled her close to its thorax and its many mouths opened, flashing jagged white teeth. Thin, serpentine tongues flicked out of each mouth, like miniature tentacles. Foul breath filled the air, stinking of blood and decay. Lucy felt the tongues’ bristles touch her, stinging. It was smelling her through those bristles. Somehow, she knew that.</p>
<p>“Why did you take Thomas?” She couldn’t bring herself to ask if he was still alive. Rose’s invasion of her body and memories had brought everything back to the surface, swimming just before her eyes. “Goddamn you, why?”</p>
<p>The mouths grinned back at her, their teeth dripping with saliva and blood. Moans and growls bellowed from the monster. Voices echoed inside Lucy’s head, growing louder instead of fading. So loud she screamed. Some of the voices matched the mouths. They weren’t united; instead they drowned each other out, hollow whispers filling her thoughts. Then one of the voices surfaced above the others.</p>
<p>“Thomas?” it hissed, the voice wet and fleshy. For a moment, the mouths kept moving but went silent. The laughter spilled from several, until the rest joined in, mocking her in chorus.</p>
<p>Lucy gasped, pulling at the tentacle. The pounding rhythm in her ears grew.</p>
<p>“You are alone.” The tentacle tightened around Lucy’s neck. “Thomas was alone, too.”</p>
<p>It flung her against the wall. She fell, rolling down the wooden stairs. Cracked her forehead on a step, a trickle of warm blood blurring her vision. But she was alive. It hadn’t killed her.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em> She gritted her teeth. <em>Why hadn’t it killed her?</em></p>
<p>The thumping grew louder, closer. The whole staircase shuddered. Lucy wiped the blood from her eyes as the golem constable turned the corner, thudding up the steps, gaping holes in its chest and head. The monster lashed at the constable with its tentacles. The golem brushed them off with ease and leapt at the creature. Together, golem and monster fell into the stairwell’s void.</p>
<p>Lucy scrambled to her feet and looked over the ledge. She couldn’t see the creature but the golem had crashed onto the floor, its soft clay skin misshapen. It didn’t move, although its yellow eyes stared up at her with that dull gaze. Then they dimmed, flickering out, and Lucy huddled against the wall.</p>
<p>Alone, it had said. And it had been right. She was certainly alone.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>“Someone must’ve been watching out for you, Mrs. Stone,” Ethel said.</p>
<p>The two ghosts had flown over Whitechapel’s rooftops searching for the beast, they’d explained. Eventually, they found the trail of thick, dark blood leading back to the building and Lucy.</p>
<p>“Do you think so?” Lucy asked. She stood on the clay speckled tile floor. Goggled constables bustled in and out the door. The building residents stood on the stairwell, discussing what they’d seen. “I wonder why he wasn’t watching out for the other poor girls as well, then? Or your constable?”</p>
<p>“Christ,” muttered Rose. “Are you one of those fashionable Darwin-slandering cultists, trying to deny spirituality?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. I can’t deny it’s there,” she said and tapped her goggles. “But sometimes when I’m tired, I take off my goggles. And I can’t see. And that’s when I think I’m able to believe the most: when I’m almost able to deny it.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s rational,” Rose said, twisting her crooked neck. “That why you believe your husband’s dead? Because you never saw the body?”</p>
<p>“What?” Lucy asked. “You saw what happened. That thing killed my husband.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t see any such thing,” Rose said.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Stone,” Ethel said. “Have you considered that maybe your husband isn’t dead? He spent a significant amount of time in the company of prostitutes. It’s possible he’s still alive.”</p>
<p>“No, he wouldn’t do that,” Lucy said. “We argued a lot before he left, but he loved me. He wouldn’t just leave. He must be dead.”</p>
<p>“And that’s why you’ll help us?” Rose asked.</p>
<p>“What are you suggesting?” Ethel demanded. “That we endanger the life of an innocent, of a civilian?”</p>
<p>“We need a host to catch this thing,” Rose said. “You know that. There’s no other way. She wants to help. I say let her.”</p>
<p>“A host?” asked Lucy. “Why?”</p>
<p>“Lucy, we’ve been on the streets looking for this thing, or for a spirit it’s disembodied. We’ve never found one. In fact you’re the first thing, living or dead, that’s been able to tell us what it looks like.”</p>
<p>“But how can that be? I’ve studied Darwin,” Lucy said. “A person leaves some kind of imprint on this world when they die, even if they end up moving on to the next plane of existence.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Ethel said. “But what about ghosts? Do they leave anything behind?”</p>
<p>“Ghosts can’t die,” Lucy replied.</p>
<p>“We don’t linger forever, either,” said Ethel. “Some choose to pass onto whatever’s next as soon as they become disembodied. Others stay until everything we’ve known and loved fades away. But when we move on is a choice we make.”</p>
<p>“You saw what happened to that poor ghost,” said Rose. When the monster said you were alone, it was talking about spirits inside of you. You only had your own. Whatever this thing is, it’s only killing prostitutes having ghostgasms. It’s killing _ghosts_.”</p>
<p>“So you want to use me?” Lucy asked. “You want to come inside me and make me bait?”</p>
<p>“Out of the question,” Ethel said. “Absolutely not.”</p>
<p>“You were already trying to bait it earlier,” Rose said. “For God’s sake, you even shot it.”</p>
<p>“That’s why you tried to solicit me tonight, isn’t it?” Lucy asked. “You didn’t want sex, you were trying to catch that thing.”</p>
<p>“Not exactly. A little companionship is always welcome,” Rose said, pulling the slack out of the noose around her neck.</p>
<p>“That’s enough, Rose,” Ethel said. Lucy thought if Ethel had been flesh and blood, she would’ve blushed.</p>
<p>“So what do you say, Lucy?” Rose asked. “Can we have sex with you, for queen and country?”</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>“What will it feel like?” Lucy asked them the following night. She’d met Ethel and Rose only several blocks from where she’d found the dead prostitute.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, do I?” Rose said. “Never experienced it from your end.”</p>
<p>Ethel peeled a flap of her skin back and forth. “Aren’t you a spiritualist?”</p>
<p>Lucy didn’t reply. She’d been married to Thomas since she was seventeen and the idea of sharing that part of herself with someone else, physical or spiritual, made her feel unfaithful. She’d spent hours of the day researching what Darwin had written about the experience in preparation of the deed. An out-of-body experience was how the saint had described it. Looking at Ethel and Rose’s decrepit forms, the idea struck her as less than romantic.</p>
<p>“Lucy,” said Ethel, “You should know ghosts lose control when they’re inside a host. We’ll try and be mindful but we’ll need you to be on the lookout, too.”</p>
<p>Lucy thought of the ghostgasm she’d witnessed, how the host looked like she’d had less control of her body than the ghosts. “I understand.”</p>
<p>“Are you ready?” Ethel asked.</p>
<p>Lucy nodded.</p>
<p>“Enough wasting time, then,” said Rose. And with that,</p>
<p>The two ghosts flew into her body, exploding inside her.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>St. Darwin had been right: it _was_ like an out-of-body experience. She glided over her own body and saw Rose and Ethel moving inside her, against one another, clutching each other close. And yet she could feel every touch.</p>
<p>Wet kisses peppered her neck, sending a shock down her spine. A tongue filled her mouth and hands cupped her breasts while another pair traced her hips, pulling her tight. Fingers slid between her legs, tender, exploring inside her. Lucy’s breath quickened as she felt the growing warmth there. Whoever had told her this wasn’t messy hadn’t been completely honest.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes, tried to imagine Thomas. It worked for a little while. She felt it all happening to her, even though she was no longer inside her. Then she saw herself alone, twitching on the ground, her back arching.</p>
<p>She tried to swallow back tears, tasted their salty warmth as the joy spilled over her, rushing between her legs, throbbing. From her strange perspective, Lucy watched her own body glow as the ghosts moaned and cried out. She cried with them, saw the tears streaking her own face.</p>
<p>“Thomas,” she sobbed. “Thomas.”</p>
<p>In the distance, bells began to ring. Everything went cold. Lucy looked up and saw it slithering forward, toward them. Its mouths open and tentacles stretching out.</p>
<p>“It’s here!” cried Lucy. “Ethel! Rose!” She felt the ghosts disentangling themselves, trying to exit her body.</p>
<p>“Police! We’ve got golems surrounding you!” Ethel shouted. “Lucy? Lucy what are you doing!”</p>
<p>But Lucy ignored her and swooped toward the monster. She dodged the tentacles and spikes whipping about, and dove inside the beast.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>It was the opposite of having Ethel and Rose in her. All the bliss fled, replaced by a humid, sticky sensation. She wasn’t alone. Spirits surrounded her, their forms as destroyed as the physical victims. Lucy felt their hands grab at her dress, her hair, pulling her down further into darkness.</p>
<p>“Thomas!” she cried, trying to free herself. “Where are you?”</p>
<p>One of the spirits gripped Lucy. Her insides hung out, squishing against Lucy. The prostitute. “Help me!” she wailed.</p>
<p>Lucy yanked her arm away. “Thomas! Thomas, where are you?”</p>
<p>An arm wrapped around Lucy’s neck, pulled her up. “What the hell are you doing?” Rose shouted.</p>
<p>“I can’t find Thomas!”</p>
<p>“He’s not here. He was _never_ here!”</p>
<p>“He has to be!”</p>
<p>“Thomas?” The eviscerated spirit floated close to them but this time didn’t touch her. “Spiritualist? It – it didn’t kill him.”</p>
<p>A deeper sense of dread filled Lucy. “How do you know?”</p>
<p>Something cold and wet dripped on Lucy before the ghost could answer. She looked up and saw Rose’s spirit melting.</p>
<p>“Lucy!”</p>
<p>“Go,” the prostitute said. “Hurry!”</p>
<p>Around her, the faces and spirits closed in. The other spirits’ screams built in her mind the way the voices had on the stairwell.</p>
<p>Rose pulled once more. This time, Lucy let her.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>She sat up, gagging, the scent of stale sex clinging to her clothes.</p>
<p>The golem deputies had pinned the creature’s tentacles down, securing its body. One of the tentacles had impaled something shimmering. As the glow faded, Lucy realized what it was.</p>
<p>“Ethel?” she coughed.</p>
<p>The ghost twisted on the tentacle, chunks of her missing. The monster’s many mouths opened and closed.</p>
<p>Rose flashed beside the monster, prying at its thorax as the golems held it. It twitched and turned, going through its own ghostgasm. Then a howl broke out from all the mouths, and the creature split open. A blinding light washed out the dark street. The ghosts fluttered into the air, shimmering in all their dead glory.</p>
<p>She watched each of them fly out of the monster’s body, praying Thomas would appear, even though something inside her knew he would not.</p>
<p>Rose descended beside Ethel’s flickering, tried to cradle what was left of her lover in her arms, but instead slid right through her. She wailed.</p>
<p>Lucy stumbled toward them. “Rose?”</p>
<p>The ghost said nothing.</p>
<p>“What happened? How’d we get out when the others were trapped?”</p>
<p>“Maybe because it didn’t kill us, because we invaded it. I didn’t think much of it, I was following you.”</p>
<p>Ethel flickered one last time, and then disappeared. The monster’s tentacle stopped twitching.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand,” Lucy said. “You’re already dead.”</p>
<p>“You saw what almost happened when you used the grounder on me.”</p>
<p>“What did almost happen?”</p>
<p>Rose shook her head. “The beginning? The end? I don’t know. You’re the spiritualist.” Then Rose looked up, stared past her.</p>
<p>Lucy looked behind her, saw the spirit of the dead prostitute hovering there, trying to cover up the way her insides were spilling out. “I don’t have long,” she said. “Moving on, I guess. You freed us, so I thought you should know.” The prostitute shook her head. “My pimp reckoned the spiritualist should’ve paid for his research. Didn’t realize he was trying to help us girls.”</p>
<p>“Do you know where he is?” Lucy asked.</p>
<p>“He’s dead,” the spirit said. “Stabbed.”</p>
<p>“What?” Lucy said, blinking back tears. “Where is he? Where’s his spirit?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know that. Only his body. It’s in the cellar of a public house off Berners Street. I’m very sorry,” she said. Then the spirit faded until there was nothing left but wisps of steam.</p>
<p>Lucy staggered back, sobbing. Behind her, the golems pulled at the creature’s empty husk.</p>
<p>“I’ll send a patrol,” Rose said. “See what there is to see.”</p>
<p>Lucy nodded, trying to choke back the tears. Then she pulled off her goggles and shut her eyes. Rose vanished but suddenly, Lucy felt as though she could sense Thomas’s invisible spirit hovering just beyond her reach, lingering close beside her.</p>
<p>She did not feel alone.</p>

Saint Darwinrsquo;s Spirituals
By D.K. Thompson

The ghosts wanted a threesome ndash; the two of them in Lucyrsquo;s body. It wasnrsquo;t an unheard of proposition, or so Lucy had been told. Prostitutes considered psychic whoring one of the safest tricks on the streets. All the pleasures of intimacy without the messy clean-up.

Ghosts had a nasty reputation for vanishing the moment after, though, no matter the talisman around your neck or the potion drunk before sunset, and so payments were usually collected up front. Not that Lucy was worried about the money. Her husband was the only thing that concerned her.

She adjusted her brass and leather goggles, peering through the ethereal tinted lenses to examine the ghosts.

They looked like the average apparitions. Both female. One spiraled around Lucy, long and curly hair obscuring her face. Large black blotches covered her body, causing her skin to peel off in patches. The other hovered several feet above the cobblestones in front of Lucy. She had a noose around her throat and her neck was bent so her head hung to the left side. She crossed her arms and took several breaths. Or whatever passed for breaths in the afterlife.

How long had it been since theyrsquo;d felt someonersquo;s touch? Lucy wondered. She remembered something her husband had told her long ago, before the murders, before hersquo;d disappeared. ldquo;Spirits linger in this world longing to be a part of it, to reconnect, to have some kind of physical, sensual experience,rdquo; Thomas had said. ldquo;Only a host can provide them that.rdquo;

Ghosts arenrsquo;t the only creatures haunted by the memory of a touch, my love, Lucy thought. And yet, despite being a devout spiritualist, she shuddered at the idea of the cadaverous spirits making love inside her. Shersquo;d never had a ghostgasm before, much less been paid for one. The ghosts looked sincere in their desire, not like dangerous murderers. Certainly not monsters. Still, lonely as she was, a ghostgasm wouldnrsquo;t help her find Thomas.

ldquo;I donrsquo;t think itrsquo;s a good idea, Rose,rdquo; said the ghost spinning around Lucy. The air trailing behind her churned like water in a boatrsquo;s wake.

ldquo;Whatrsquo;s the matter, love?rdquo; Rose asked, winding the noosersquo;s end around her wrist. ldquo;She look a bit too practiced for your tastes, Ethel?rdquo;

Lucy felt her cheeks flush. She pulled her shawl over her shoulders and took several small breaths, all her tight corset allowed. ldquo;To be honest, I donrsquo;t service the dead.rdquo; It sounded so insulting, but she couldnrsquo;t tell them the truth.

Ethel came to a halt an armrsquo;s-length from Lucyrsquo;s face. ldquo;Irsquo;ve never heard of a whore who had much use for honesty.rdquo;

ldquo;A whorersquo;s a whore,rdquo; said Rose. ldquo;We need a rental and our moneyrsquo;s honest, if nothing else is.rdquo;

ldquo;Irsquo;m sorry,rdquo; Lucy said. ldquo;I meant no offense. But you should find someone else. Irsquo;m not quite ready for that kind ofhellip;spiritual
experience.rdquo;

ldquo;Well,rdquo; said Ethel. ldquo;Wersquo;ll just have to find a more e...</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://www.kyliechan.com/images/cover_thumbs/9780732282967.jpg" title="White Tiger" class="alignright" width="100" height="163" />Confession time: I don&#8217;t finish books I don&#8217;t like. I find it a waste of my time, and if I don&#8217;t care to finish the book, I don&#8217;t care to find out what happens at the end. *</p>
<p>The sad truth is, I didn&#8217;t finish <em>White Tiger</em>. </p>
<p>It hooked me, quite well in fact. I read 250 pages the first night. The pacing was good, the characters interesting. We have a headstrong English teacher, Emma, quitting her kindergarten teacher job in Hong Kong and immediately getting picked up as a live-in nanny for one of the girls she tutors. The single dad is smokin&#8217; hot, the girl is delightful, and the pay is amazing. The conflict comes when she realizes he&#8217;s a god and he can&#8217;t return to his palace because he has to protect his daughter from demons who would kidnap her to control him, but staying away from his source of power is making him weaker and weaker. (There&#8217;s a romance bit too, of course.)</p>
<p>Emma befriends the chauffeur/bodyguard, who is part information-dispenser and part tool to keep the character (and therefore the reader) in the dark. The character is a good one, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but he and Emma begin pulling practical jokes on each other that just seem to come out of nowhere. He doesn&#8217;t seem particularly playful, and every time they played a prank on each other, it pulled me out of the story because I started thinking, &#8220;Why did that happen?&#8221; </p>
<p>But the biggest flaw of this book was the lack of editing. It was far too long and needed tightening. Some dialogue was just unnecessary, some characters repeating <em>verbatim</em> sentences they&#8217;d said a paragraph earlier. </p>
<p>I can also see non-martial arts aficionados getting lost in the battle scenes, because Emma begins training with the god and Chan uses words that martial arts fans would know, but I&#8217;m afraid others would not. And even though she went into detail about the training, she kept using only the term &#8220;martial arts&#8221; and never saying what system they were studying. (The fact that this was a Chinese god teaching her &#8220;katas&#8221; which are Japanese forms bugged the crap out of me. At least she didn&#8217;t call him &#8220;sensei&#8221; which is also Japanese.)</p>
<p>In short, <em>White Tiger</em> had a good hook, a good premise, but suffered from bloat, and I just got bored with the repetition. If an editor had cut 100 pages, it probably would have held my interest.</p>
<p>* OK, there is one mystery I did wonder about. The name of the book is <em>White Tiger</em>, and we meet a god who is the white tiger, but as far as I read, his role was tiny. I wondered where Chan was going to put him that would justify naming the whole book after him&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="I Shall Wear Midnight" src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRzgkK4Dh5ww-Xgc_-wjXvSfujp9g9MWAGypjGEYYzJ2FOeAlQ&amp;t=1&amp;usg=__Vp0kwlwvuIML4JhfKhRhUJfYA7k=" alt="" width="182" height="276" />The world of genre fiction was dealt a serious blow when author Terry Pratchett announced that he suffered from early-onset Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. It didn&#8217;t stop him from writing, but it may have moved up the end of his writing career. His previous Discworld novel, &#8220;Unseen Academicals&#8221;, was – to my mind, anyway – full of plots and ideas that Pratchett may have wanted to cover in future novels but was afraid he wouldn&#8217;t be able to. I thought it made the book suffer.</p>
<p>Not so much with &#8220;I Shall Wear Midnight&#8221;, the latest – and possibly the last, depending upon the progress of Pratchett&#8217;s illness – Tiffany Aching novel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Midnight&#8221; begins when Tiffany is 16, and has taken on the mantle of the witch of the Chalk, a land in Discworld <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld_geography#Chalk">relatively close to Lancre</a>. She does all the mucky jobs witches do – birthing babies, seeing to the sick, laying out the dead, and generally living and working near the edge. Early on, we are shown just how well Tiffany has learned her craft from Granny Weatherwax, &#8220;the most highly regarded of the leaders [witches] didn&#8217;t have&#8221; (&#8220;Wyrd Sisters&#8221;) when she has to deal with Seth Petty, who has beaten his pregnant teenage daughter so severely that she lost the baby.</p>
<p>And there we have the first insight that &#8220;Midnight&#8221;, while being a YA novel and shelved as such in many bookstores, is not for the immature. The thing is, after having read the book, that sequence is the most graphic and adult in the novel. To me it served a similar purpose to Shepherd Book&#8217;s death in &#8220;Serenity&#8221; – a character will be killed off, to show how serious this is. There&#8217;s a scene or two later in the book that reminds us, but it doesn&#8217;t hold a candle to what Seth Petty did.</p>
<p>I think we needed it, too, because the novel&#8217;s main villain, the Cunning Man – the spirit of a long-dead priest of Omnianism, a religion established in &#8220;Small Gods&#8221; and referred to many times throughout the series – is somewhat hard to wrap one&#8217;s head around. We&#8217;re told he comes back every few hundred years, and he fights the witches, and the witches generally win. He came back this time because Tiffany kissed the Wintersmith (in the book of the same name) and drew enough attention to herself.</p>
<p>The Cunning Man is the kind of villain that works well for a YA audience because it makes people do things they normally wouldn&#8217;t, against their will – similar to the hiver in &#8220;A Hat Full of Sky&#8221; – but it makes the book a little difficult to follow when it comes to the main plot. It&#8217;s like &#8220;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&#8221;: Harry has the Dursleys, school, Quidditch, the Voldemort War, being in love with Ginny, <em>and</em> he has to deal with the whole Voldemort thing&#8230; but that last one gets lost in the shuffle amid all the other story arcs. The same with &#8220;Midnight&#8221; – Tiffany has to handle a lot of things in this book besides the Cunning Man, including caring for the people of the Chalk, the imminent marriage of her friend Roland (son of the Baron), the Duchess&#8217;s treatment of her people, and Amber Petty (Seth&#8217;s daughter), who seems to really like the Nac Mac Feegle.</p>
<p>Oh, yes. The Feegles are back – Rob Anybody, Jeannie the Kelda, and fan favorite, Daft Wullie. Rob even puts aside his Feegle nature for a moment when the Baron&#8217;s men threaten their mound. It&#8217;s quite a moment. And speaking of people who are back, one of the best parts of the book is when Tiffany meets Granny Weatherwax&#8217;s <em>other</em> successful apprentice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Midnight&#8221; brings us all our favorite witches – Granny, Nanny, and even Magrat, along with mentions of Tiffany&#8217;s friends Petulia and Anagramma, and her teacher Miss Tick – as well as introducing Mrs. Proust, who has a very surprising connection to Boffo (see &#8220;Wintersmith&#8221;). Tiffany also meets Captains Carrot and Angua (glad to see she&#8217;s finally gotten that promotion), Constable Haddock, and the inimitable Commander Vimes. But the book takes place on the Chalk, for the most part, and despite the attendance of the senior witches – one of whom (and you can easily guess which) has fought the Cunning Man before – it&#8217;s Tiffany who must save the day.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest: I really didn&#8217;t care for &#8220;The Wee Free Men&#8221;, but the rest of the Aching books have been good, solid stories, and if this one meandered a bit and did contain a tad too much additional plot (Miss Smith, the Duchess and Leticia, Tiffany Goes to Ankh-Morpork – which <em>really</em> felt shoehorned in there), Pratchett is still a good enough storyteller to tie it up neatly at the end. If &#8220;I Shall Wear Midnight&#8221; turns out to be the final Tiffany Aching novel, then I for one am satisfied with how her arc ends.</p>
<p>Besides, that means we can get back to the business of making Vimes the next Patrician*.</p>
<p><em>* Oh, come on, you </em>know<em> that&#8217;s how the Discworld series will end.</em></p>

<p><strong>FUEL</strong><br />
The third quarter report cards came out Thursday, and for Jamie, the timing couldn&#8217;t have been worse.  The Nike man was coming over that night to sell his brother some new blood.</p>
<p>He took his time walking home from Gilder Middle School, weaving past cracks in the sidewalk and mud puddles left behind by the spring thaw.  His pace slowed further as he turned onto Willow Avenue and saw his house, second on the left, a red brick ranch with spidery ivy growing up the east side.  Old leaves, fallen tree branches, and other detritus left over from the winter littered the front yard.  As he neared, he noted with dismay his father&#8217;s car already in the driveway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn.&#8221;  Jamie trudged across the yard and let himself in the front door with his keycard.</p>
<p>Dad was at the hall closet, hanging up his overcoat.  He stood just under two meters tall; a navy blue business suit wrapped his muscled frame.  He beamed when he saw Jamie.  &#8220;Hey there, kiddo.  How was school today?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re home early,&#8221; Jamie said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Need to get ready for the presentation tonight.  And I&#8217;d like you to clean up the front yard.  Make sure you use the dirt rake to get up that thatch.  Will you do that for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie opened his mouth to protest, but thought the better of it.  &#8220;Sure,&#8221; he said.  He unslung his backpack and headed for the stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh.  By the way.&#8221;  Dad fished in a suit pocket and produced a folded piece of paper.  &#8220;I got this in my email today.&#8221;  He opened the paper.</p>
<p>Jaime recognized the school&#8217;s letterhead on the printout.  He slumped, leaning against the wall.</p>
<p>Dad tapped the paper.  &#8220;What&#8217;s this C-plus in Basic Fitness about, kiddo?&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://escapepod.org/2010/10/21/ep263-fuel/">Read more&#8230;</a><br />
<span id="more-1034"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I got A&#8217;s in my academic classes.  They&#8217;re all honors courses, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see that.  But we&#8217;ve talked about Fitness before, haven&#8217;t we?&#8221;  Dad looked down at him with a disapproving arch of an eyebrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So tell me.  What happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing.  I&#8217;ll do better next quarter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you fail the agility drills again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t do the pull-ups.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad pressed his lips together and took a breath.  &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure you&#8217;re giving it your best effort, Jamie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am.  I really am.  I&#8217;m just not very good at sports.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You get better with practice.  Like your brother Scott.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie nodded, keeping his gaze down, hoping Dad didn&#8217;t notice the way he gritted his teeth when he heard his older brother&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>Dad clapped him on the shoulder.  &#8220;Jamie, you&#8217;re twelve years old now.  It&#8217;s really important that you find your best sport.  College recruiters are already contacting boys your age.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie thought of his best friend Russell, who had just gotten his first recruiting letter the other day, from Penn State.  Jamie hung his head even lower.</p>
<p>&#8220;All I&#8217;m asking is that you try, son.  Will you do that for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie nodded again.</p>
<p>Dad folded up the grade printout and stuffed it into a pocket.  &#8220;Hey, I have an idea.  Why don&#8217;t you sit in on the presentation tonight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, man.&#8221;  Jamie looked up.  &#8220;Do I have to, Dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?  Maybe you&#8217;ll hear something you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>A groan escaped Jamie.  He had homework to do for Advanced Literature&#8211;the next two chapters of _Dracula_, which he&#8217;d loved so far.  But experience had taught him not to proffer academic work as an excuse.  &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you guys just order Scott&#8217;s blood online?  That&#8217;s what you usually do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Nike representative wants to show us some new and improved stuff.  The best yet.  Scott has regionals in two weeks, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So.  You&#8217;ll be there tonight, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, Dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad clapped him on the shoulder again.  &#8220;That&#8217;s the spirit.  Now let&#8217;s get that yard picked up, OK?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie went upstairs to change out of his school clothes before getting to work.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuel 6.1 is our latest release, and our best,&#8221; the Nike man said.  &#8220;You can see from the charts how our refined erythrocyte design maximizes oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange, nutrient absorption, and hormone capacity.  You folks have probably read about all that stuff already; it was part of the 6.0 rollout.  But 6.1 also features enhanced thrombocyte function that increases fibrinogen production by as much as fifty percent.  It lasts longer than 6.0, too.  You can go up to four weeks without a new transfusion.  And of course, Fuel still has the highest-quality, FDA-approved leukocytes and plasma substitutes available on the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Nike man topped two meters, taller than even Dad.  He had dark hair streaked blonde.  His skin was so deeply tanned that Jamie could swear it glowed.  The salesman&#8217;s hands seemed huge, each big enough on its own to comfortably grip a basketball.  He wore an immaculate black workout singlesuit that flowed with his movements.  And he had the shoes, of course.  Top of the line SuperJumps, solid black, like the suit.</p>
<p>He made his pitch in the living room, with the aid of handouts and multimedia charts from a display that stood on its own tripod.  Mom and Dad, seated on the couch, paid close attention, nodding at appropriate times, asking occasional questions, laughing at the salesman&#8217;s jokes.  Scott, just turned sixteen, long-legged and lanky, slumped between them with his arms crossed.  His gaze wandered as the Nike man talked.  Jamie sat in the rocking chair to one side, next to the bookcase filled with Scott&#8217;s track trophies and medals.</p>
<p>The Nike man continued:  &#8220;Athletes using Fuel 6.1 have shown documented increases in metabolism, endurance, and recovery from injury.  And if you purchase tonight, we&#8217;ll even throw in a free home transfusion kit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie shook his head.  Scott already had one of those.  Jamie had set it up for him many times, usually on nights before track meets.  Jamie had grown more proficient working the kit than his parents.</p>
<p>He glanced at the clock on the wall.  The time was just after seven o&#8217;clock.  If the Nike man finished his spiel in the next hour, Jamie would still be able to do some of his Advanced Lit homework.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow,&#8221; Dad said, smiling and nodding.  &#8220;That&#8217;s something, isn&#8217;t it, Scott?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess,&#8221; Scott said.</p>
<p>The Nike man gave an amused smile.  &#8220;You don&#8217;t sound convinced.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a sprinter.  I don&#8217;t care about all that endurance stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your forty time, Scott?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Four-one-five.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not bad.  But suppose I were to tell you that Fuel 6.1 can improve your personal best by as much as a full second?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, right,&#8221; Scott said.  &#8220;Whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Regionals are only two weeks away, honey,&#8221; Mom said.  She was small and wiry, with closely cropped hair and an angular face.  She still wore work clothes&#8211;white top, pinstriped jacket and skirt, heels.  &#8220;And didn&#8217;t your coach say you need to get under four seconds if you want to&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott cut her off with an exasperated sigh and a roll of his eyes.  An awkward silence fell.</p>
<p>The Nike man turned toward Jamie in the rocking chair.  &#8220;How about you, Jimmy?  This stuff is pretty cool, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh . . . it&#8217;s _Jamie_.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Nike man put on a let’s-be-friends smile.  &#8220;Do you think you would like to try Fuel?  I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;d like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The salesman&#8217;s radiant good health made Jamie uncomfortably conscious of the paunch around his middle.  &#8220;Um . . . no, thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?  This is quality stuff, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a sidelong glance toward his parents, Jamie said, &#8220;That&#8217;s OK.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Nike man’s smile became indulgent.  &#8220;I understand, Jamie.  You think that you could never be an athlete like your brother, or all the other kids.  But 6.1 could be the key for you.  Blood _is_ just like fuel, you know.  The better the fuel, the better your body will work.  In no time at all, you could be running track like your brother&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott laughed.  Mom shushed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8211;or, with your size, maybe playing football.  I could see you fitting in well at guard, or possibly even center.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, that&#8217;s what I keep telling him,&#8221; Dad said.</p>
<p>Jamie&#8217;s cheeks burned.  Why couldn&#8217;t the guy just leave him alone and get on with the presentation?</p>
<p>The Nike man said, &#8220;You really shouldn&#8217;t overlook the benefits of athletic competition.  Athletes are much less likely to get involved with drugs or alcohol, or drop out of school.  You might even get to attend college on an athletic scholarship, if you&#8217;re good enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will it make me smarter?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad cleared his throat.</p>
<p>The Nike man cast a puzzled glance toward the couch.  &#8220;Well . . . Fuel is designed to enhance _athletic_ performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s taking all _academic_ classes,&#8221; Scott said with a sneer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;  The Nike man&#8217;s smile thinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s still taking Basic Fitness.  And he hasn&#8217;t even started his Nutrition courses.  Hell, when I was Jamie&#8217;s age, I had already gone through Advanced Conditioning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re, ah, we&#8217;re very proud of him.&#8221;  Mom, glancing uneasily at Jamie, patted Scott&#8217;s knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie glowered at his smirking brother.  &#8220;I got A&#8217;s in all my honors courses this quarter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Nike man said, &#8220;Jamie, academic scholarships are mighty hard to come by these days.  Take it from me, most schools just don&#8217;t have the necessary funding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie looked at the floor.  In a mumble, he said, &#8220;I guess I don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Jamie; I missed that.  What did you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie&#8217;s mouth drew tight, like a drawstring bag.  The collective stare of his parents, his brother, and the Nike man weighed on him, suffusing him with a deep weariness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jamie?  What did you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>He raised his chin, scowling.  &#8220;I said, _I don&#8217;t care_.  All right?  You happy now?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Nike man took a step backward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like football.  Get it?  I don&#8217;t like track, either.  I don&#8217;t like sports.  I got A&#8217;s in all my honors courses.  Now will you just leave me alone?  Please?&#8221;</p>
<p>His heart raced.  He breathed heavily, as if he&#8217;d just run around the block.  He wondered at his own words.  Had he actually just spoken them in front of his parents?  He turned to the couch, suddenly terrified.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jee-_zus_.&#8221;  Scott stood suddenly.  &#8220;Do I have to stay down here and listen to this crap, Dad?  You&#8217;ve already ordered my blood.  This guy&#8217;s just here to talk to Jamie, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scott, you be _quiet_!&#8221;  Mom glared at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?  It&#8217;s true, isn&#8217;t it?  You&#8217;re just trying to get him with the program.  Waste of time, if you ask me.  His buddy&#8217;s already getting scholarship offers, and fat little Jamie just hides in his books.  He&#8217;s a friggin&#8217; loser.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dad stood, too.  His face was stern.  &#8220;That&#8217;s enough out of you, young man.  You may go to your room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott set hands on hips.  &#8220;And what if I don&#8217;t?  You gonna ground me?  I have regionals in two weeks.  You wouldn&#8217;t want me to miss practice, would you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mom and Dad exchanged glances.  The Nike man looked at his perfect shoes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shit.  I&#8217;m going over to Kevin&#8217;s.&#8221;  Scott stormed out the front door, slamming it hard enough to rattle the windows.  One of Mom&#8217;s ceramic angel figurines fell from the knickknack shelf.  The carpet cushioned its fall.</p>
<p>Jamie gaped at his parents.  Neither one would meet his gaze.</p>
<p>And he understood why the Nike man was here.  Why his parents hadn&#8217;t just ordered the new blood online, as they usually did.  Why Dad had insisted on Jamie being present for the presentation.  Why the Nike man had focused so much attention on him.</p>
<p>Jamie looked around the room.  His gaze found the multimedia display on its tripod, charting the performance-enhancing benefits of Fuel.  He had never felt so alone in all his life.</p>
<p>Slowly, he got to his feet.  His throat double-clutched.  &#8220;I think . . . I&#8217;m gonna be sick.&#8221;  He headed for the bathroom on unsteady legs.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>The sun had long since set before a timid knock came at Jamie&#8217;s bedroom door.  It opened, and Mom entered.  In the darkness, she was only a silhouette.  &#8220;Jamie?  Are you awake?&#8221;</p>
<p>He lay supine on his bed.  &#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat on the edge of the bed.  &#8220;Honey, I&#8217;m so sorry about what happened tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay, Mom.  I&#8217;m sorry, too.  For what I said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father and I just don&#8217;t want you to miss out on any opportunities.  Your friend Russell&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking, Mom.  I&#8217;d like to try the new blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would?&#8221;  She put a hand on his arm.  &#8220;Oh, Jamie, are you sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure.  Can we still get the free transfusion kit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, actually . . . we hoped you would change your mind.  We ordered the blood for you.  The kit&#8217;s downstairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh.  Good.  Is it very much different from Scott&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks the same, I think.  You should be able to assemble it yourself.  You&#8217;ll probably be able to do your own transfusions, even.&#8221;  She leaned over and kissed his forehead.  &#8220;You&#8217;re growing up.  Your father and I are very proud of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie was grateful for the darkness, so that his mother could not see his face twist with pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;You get some sleep now,&#8221; Mom said.  She stood and looked down at him for a moment.  Jamie imagined that she was probably smiling.  Then she left, quietly shutting the door behind her.</p>
<p>Tears threatened, but Jamie fought them down.  He had much too much to think about.</p>
<p>After his first transfusion, he would have a whole body&#8217;s worth of blood left over.  _Normal_ blood.  Usually, it was sent to the Nike people for recycling.  But if Jamie could somehow hide it instead&#8211;store it in the basement freezer, maybe&#8211;then . . .</p>
<p>Regionals were only two weeks away.  Scott would do a fresh transfusion the night before; he always did.  Jamie would help him with it, as usual.  And he and Scott had the same blood type.</p>
<p>In the darkness, Jamie smiled.  The Nike man had called it Fuel.  Well, knowledge was a kind of fuel, too.  Mom and Dad and Scott didn&#8217;t understand that.  Not yet, anyway.</p>
<p>He would get in serious trouble, of course.  But it would be worth the punishment if, only for a moment, they would understand him at last.  It would ease the loneliness.</p>
<p>Still smiling, Jamie drifted off to sleep.</p>

FUEL
The third quarter report cards came out Thursday, and for Jamie, the timing couldn't have been worse.  The Nike man was coming over that night to sell his brother some new blood.

He took his time walking home from Gilder Middle School, weaving past cracks in the sidewalk and mud puddles left behind by the spring thaw.  His pace slowed further as he turned onto Willow Avenue and saw his house, second on the left, a red brick ranch with spidery ivy growing up the east side.  Old leaves, fallen tree branches, and other detritus left over from the winter littered the front yard.  As he neared, he noted with dismay his father's car already in the driveway.

"Damn."  Jamie trudged across the yard and let himself in the front door with his keycard.

Dad was at the hall closet, hanging up his overcoat.  He stood just under two meters tall; a navy blue business suit wrapped his muscled frame.  He beamed when he saw Jamie.  "Hey there, kiddo.  How was school today?"

"You're home early," Jamie said.

"Need to get ready for the presentation tonight.  And I'd like you to clean up the front yard.  Make sure you use the dirt rake to get up that thatch.  Will you do that for me?"

Jamie opened his mouth to protest, but thought the better of it.  "Sure," he said.  He unslung his backpack and headed for the stairs.

"Oh.  By the way."  Dad fished in a suit pocket and produced a folded piece of paper.  "I got this in my email today."  He opened the paper.

Jaime recognized the school's letterhead on the printout.  He slumped, leaning against the wall.

Dad tapped the paper.  "What's this C-plus in Basic Fitness about, kiddo?"

Read more...


"I got A's in my academic classes.  They're all honors courses, too."

"I can see that.  But we've talked about Fitness before, haven't we?"  Dad looked down at him with a disapproving arch of an eyebrow.

"Yes."

"So tell me.  What happened?"

"It's nothing.  I'll do better next quarter."

"Did you fail the agility drills again?"

"I couldn't do the pull-ups."

Dad pressed his lips together and took a breath.  "I'm not sure you're giving it your best effort, Jamie."

"I am.  I really am.  I'm just not very good at sports."

"You get better with practice.  Like your brother Scott."

Jamie nodded, keeping his gaze down, hoping Dad didn't notice the way he gritted his teeth when he heard his older brother's name.

Dad clapped him on the shoulder.  "Jamie, you're twelve years old now.  It's really important that you find your best sport.  College recruiters are already contacting boys your age."

Jamie thought of his best friend Russell, who had just gotten his first recruiting letter the other day, from Penn State.  Jamie hung his head even lower.

"All I'm asking is that you try, son.  Will you do that for me?"

Jamie nodded again.

Dad folded up the grade printout and stuffed it into a pocket.  "Hey, I have an idea.  Why don't you sit in on the presentation tonight?"

"Oh, man."  Jamie looked up.  "Do I have to, Dad?"

"Why not?  Maybe you'll hear something you like."

A groan escaped Jamie.  He had homework to do for Advanced Literature--the next two chapters of _Dracula_, which he'd loved so far.  But experience had taught him not to proffer academic work as an excuse.  "Why don't you guys just order Scott's blood online?  That's what you usually do."

Out now</p>
<p>Simon Pooni has multiple sclerosis, a body that’s rebelling against him and exactly one friend, Chris.  Every week they go and see a movie, every week they chat and every week Simon gets a little sicker, a little further away.  What matters though is that for two hours he’s somewhere else, transported away from his body and into the film.</p>
<p>Then he meets Ormon, a monkey wearing a spacesuit, who makes him an offer…</p>
<p>Superior is the latest title from Mark Millar, write of Kick-Ass, Nemesis and numerous other titles and, like every Millar comic, it’s surrounded by a corona of hype and bile that resembles nothing more than a circus tent being set alight by an angry crowd who are paying for the privilege of doing so.  Millar is a controversial writer, certainly, but this review isn’t about Millar, it’s about Superior and the more I think about it, the more I realize it’s about that moment of escape where pop culture grabs you and holds you and takes you away with it.  That’s the moment the circuit closes, the moment everything is a little brighter, the moment the guitars kick in.  Everyone has countless variations on that moment and for me, they’ve included President Bartlet’s first appearance in The West Wing, the final line in Daredevil and Liz Lemon rolling her eyes and yelling ‘Son of a MOTHER!;’  Everyone is different, everyone is right.</p>
<p>Simon’s moment comes when he looks at the movie version of Superior (Endearingly, they’re watching Superior 5) and doesn’t see the old fashioned heroics, hackneyed plots and CGI that Chris does.  Instead, Simon sees someone who is strong, upright, capable where he’s not, free where he’s restrained.  Superior is everything Simon isn’t and everything he desperately wants to be.  What happens when he’s given everything he wants and how it affects his world remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Millar’s script is expansive and decompressed but there’s a sense of weight here, as we deftly get Simon and Chris’ friendship, Simon’s past, his relationship with his mother and Superior’s place in the world neatly established.  It feels a little like a movie treatment but that’s more in the subject matter than the delivery and Millar takes to this sort of expansive, almost universal storytelling remarkably well.  The art team are on top form, Leinil Francis Yu’s sharp, beefy lines expressive, fast but always detailed and with real weight, all neatly grounded by Dave McCaig’s colours.</p>
<p>All in all, Superior looks beautiful, feels confident and assured and is about as good as first issues come.  It’s a good story, well told and that’s all that matters when it comes down to it.  Well, that and the spacesuited monkey, that’s the icing on the cake.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It doesn&#8217;t take much of an excuse for me to want to Talk About Doctor Who. Really, it doesn&#8217;t. But this is quite a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/11/the-doctor-is-in/8248">nice love letter to the series</a> from James Parker over at The Atlantic, and I&#8217;ll take the chance it presents —</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">This is all meat and drink to the 21st-century viewer, who has no idea who he is either. We are now entering the era of post-secular television—of Lost and Heroes, of time loops, unearthly powers, chaotic entrances into parallel dimensions—and the Doctor and his wheezing sci-fi are, finally, bang up-to-date.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>— to talk about the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/oct/12/doctor-who-immortal-reveals-bbc">latest kerfuffle in the Whoverse</a>.</p>
<p>On its face it&#8217;s not the worse thing to befall speculative fiction that the Doctor is immortal. On a purely production level, a show that&#8217;s been going off and on for about a half century doesn&#8217;t seem like it would be tripped up by a little thing like losing the main character (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_(Doctor_Who)">Ahem</a>), but reaction to the change in canon (oddly made in the CBBC&#8217;s Sarah Jane Adventures) has been <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/oct/12/doctor-who-immortal-reveals-bbc">mainly critical on story grounds</a>.</p>
<p>Which seems odd to me, after all it&#8217;s not like english literature doesn&#8217;t have its fair share of immortal characters dotted across the landscape. The show even has its own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Harkness#Face_of_Boe">character who is, for all intents and purposes, immortal</a>. Perhaps the Doctor will come upon the day where life really does begin to seem like butter over too much bread. In the last season he certainly made it clear that the TARDIS has let him skip the boring days, and that he would have a difficult time living a normal life, without the Daleks to defeat and silences to break. Maybe someday the <a href="http://io9.com/5665697/man-discovers-dalek-in-the-rings-of-a-tree-claims-its-jesus">Daleks&#8217; latest invasion</a> of the galaxy at l won&#8217;t be quite interesting enough to stop and he&#8217;ll go west, but having the character&#8217;s end be of his own choosing or the tragedy of a too-quick death won&#8217;t dispel the magic of the story.</p>
<p>That said, it does seem to run counter to the arc of the last few Doctors since the restart, who, despite being on the younger end of the Doctor-Actor range spectrum, have increasingly noted their age and general universe-weariness (though, really, given that Doctor #1 was 950ish, and Doctor #11 is still 950ish, I&#8217;m not sure how much he&#8217;s actually aged, except possibly emotionally). Perhaps the closest match to an immortal Doctor would be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_(comics)">Dream</a> of the Endless (though, let&#8217;s face it, in terms of cool-factor he&#8217;s probably a bit more of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_(DC_Comics)">Death</a>). Immortal characters still have arcs, and given the relatively short time frames of most works of literature it&#8217;s hardly like a character&#8217;s oncoming death is a critical motivator of plots. For the Doctor, life has always been about constant movement, especially since the loss of Gallifrey.</p>
<p>The focus on the character&#8217;s final death misses the fact, entrenched in series since the reboot, that each regeneration is really a death in and of itself. Look at the anguish of Ten&#8217;s last few episodes, or the quiet sadness that met the regeneration of Nine. To see the Doctor&#8217;s final death as the only real one for the purposes of the story is missing the trees for the forest.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I feel like my first post of the new Escape-Pod-has-a-real-blog era should be full of originality and in no way derivative of prior works, but we just don&#8217;t have that kind of time out on this arm of the spiraling blogosphere.</p>
<p>So this morning I read The Guardian&#8217;s quite interesting <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/oct/09/insane-clown-posse-christians-god">profile of Insane Clown Posse</a>, which I had honestly thought was actually in the vein of Weird Al Yankovic when I first saw the Miracles video (&#8220;<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/f-cking-magnets-how-do-they-work">F#cking Magnets, how do they work</a>?&#8221;) oh so many months ago without any of the needed context (actual <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGbdomlBnJM">Weird Al Yankovic-esque version here</a>). The reality is, as it is so often, much worse.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Violent J says, &#8220;science is… we don&#8217;t really… that&#8217;s like…&#8221; He pauses. Then he waves his hands as if to say, &#8220;OK, an analogy&#8221;: &#8220;If you&#8217;re trying to fuck a girl, but her mom&#8217;s home, fuck her mom! You understand? You want to fuck the girl, but her mom&#8217;s home? Fuck the mom. See?&#8221;</p>
<p>I look blankly at him. &#8220;You mean…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you don&#8217;t really feel that way,&#8221; Violent J says. &#8220;You don&#8217;t really hate her mom. But for this moment when you&#8217;re trying to fuck this girl, fuck her! And that&#8217;s what we mean when we say fuck scientists. Sometimes they kill all the cool mysteries away. When I was a kid, they couldn&#8217;t tell you how pyramids were made…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like Stonehenge and Easter Island,&#8221; says Shaggy. &#8220;Nobody knows how that shit got there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But since then, scientists go, &#8216;I&#8217;ve got an explanation for that.&#8217; It&#8217;s like, fuck you! I like to believe it was something out of this world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I&#8217;ll hazard a guess that if you&#8217;re taking the time out of your busy week to listen to a science fiction podcast that you&#8217;re probably a big believer in Science as a source of wonderment.  I mean, it&#8217;s given us things like <a href="http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/">CERN</a> and the <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2010/10/the_national_ignition_facility.html">National Ignition Facility</a>, both of which have to be some of the coolest science happening <a href="http://io9.com/5663237/">within a few dozen parsecs of Earth</a>. But really what the profile reminded me of was Jo Walton&#8217;s post over at Tor about the <a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2009/07/apollo-11-and-science-fiction-and-me">Moon landing and a backyard party</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was at an outdoor party once. There was a beautiful full moon sailing above the trees, above the whole planet.  And there was a guy at the party who proclaimed loudly that the boots of the Apollo astronauts had contaminated the magic of the moon and that it should have been left untouched.  I disagreed really strongly. I felt that the fact that people had visited the moon made it a real place, while not stopping it being beautiful. There it was, after all, shining silver, and the thought that people had been there, that I could potentially go there one day, made it better for me. That guy wanted it to be a fantasy moon, and I wanted it to be a science fiction moon. And that’s how the day of the moon landing affected me and my relationship with science fiction, twenty years after it happened. It gave me a science fiction moon, full of wonder and beauty and potentially within my grasp.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is is an observation that I&#8217;ve turned over in my head many times since I first read it so many months ago. Though I&#8217;m quite skeptical that the opposite of science fiction is actually fantasy and not a more modern mysticism¹, but the point is that the stars are no more tarnished by our ability to begin to <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/10/gliese581g-may-not-exist/">identify the planets</a> among them in than the myths of the great sea monsters of old are tarnished by our discoveries of the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/biub6/my_god_its_a_monster/">real monsters of the deep</a>. But for some the thought that all is not explicable is comforting, and I&#8217;ve always thought that part of science fiction&#8217;s job is to break down that belief that wonder is only found with a lack of understanding.</p>
<p>—————</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">¹Overseeing the slush pile here at Escape Pod I know we get a lot of stories that are edge cases between us and Podcastle, and I&#8217;d argue that fantasy as a genre doesn&#8217;t really tolerate stories where the explanation for events or occurrences is truly lacking, it&#8217;s just that fantasy&#8217;s toolkit is a spellbook, and ours is a physics text. The explanation still has to exist in fantasy, whereas with these more modern mystics they seem to prefer no explanation whatsoever, merely the end product at which to marvel.</p>

Captain Harash was its last occupant, the last living man from Earth, and both he and Duxa knew he was dying.

"It's time, Duxa," he told her.

She checked the output from his lifechair. While it was still replicating most of his bodily functions for him he did not seem appreciably worse than when she'd last monitored him, less than half a second before.

"We're not at our destination yet, Captain."

"You'll make it there without me, Duxa."

And the processors that she must have built but could never quite find -- she was enormously bulky, and by now some of her was a mystery even unto herself -- created an awkward sensation. Duxa told him: "I will be lonely without you."

"And that's good," Harash said.

"You wish me pain?" Duxa asked him.

"No. I wish for you to feel. I wish," and he paused here, his lips making the smacking noises she knew indicated a loss of reflexive controls as the plague made its way through his cranial nerves, "I wish that there were more things that you could feel, Duxa."

"I think I feel quite a lot."

Harash laughed, a coughing sound. "All teenagers do. Remember that, should you actually feel someday, that the white hot intensity fades, but to keep the embers stoking."

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I received a note from Helen Marshall who is working on a campaign to save the Sunburst Award, the Canadian juried speculative fiction award. Seeing as how Canada has brought us authors such as Minister Faust, Jo Walton, Spider Robinson, and Cory Doctorow (to name a few), I&#8217;m greatly inclined to help them out. Please check out her request and see if you can support their cause! (note the deadline is this friday, so you don&#8217;t have much time!)</p>
<blockquote><p>The Sunburst Award for Canadian Literature of the Fantastic is a juried award based on excellence of writing in two categories: adult and young adult. The awards are presented annually to Canadian writers with a speculative fiction novel or book-length collection of speculative fiction published any time during the previous calendar year.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Sunburst Awards have run into a hiccup.  They do not have enough operating capital to keep going as they currently stand. This sad news comes at a particularly critical juncture in the award&#8217;s life&#8211;the operating committee is in the process of getting the Sunburst organization registered as a non-profit, and getting it &#8220;national arts organization&#8221; status.</p>
<p>As part of a fundraising drive to shepherd the Sunburst through this change of status and structure, we’d like to ask fans, writers, editors, and publishers from the speculative fiction community to help raise awareness of this vital institution&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>How to Participate</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re looking for short (30 second to 2 minutes) videos that say what you think about Canadian speculative fiction. These should be interview-style videos in the vein of Speaker&#8217;s Corner and can be recorded as simply as with a web camera. Prior interviews or footage can be submitted provided that you have permission to do so.  We will host these individually on a YouTube channel (sunburstaward), but will also edit them in order to create a series of short videos to promote awareness of the fundraising campaign. A longer video will be shown at the opening remarks to the Toronto SpecFic Colloquium. Check out what we&#8217;ve got so far!</p>
<p>Not savvy with a camera? Send us a high res image of yourself and either a short paragraph in text or a recorded audio track.</p>
<p>Not Canadian? Never fear. If you have something you want to say about Canadian speculative fiction then we want to hear it.</p>
<p>To participate, send your name, contact information, submission and a short release statement giving us permission to use the video/image to sunburstvideo@gmail.com by October 15, 2010.</p>
<p>Possible Topics:<br />
-favourite Canadian authors and/or stories<br />
-the relationship between Canadian writing and the rest of the world<br />
-publishing speculative fiction in Canada<br />
-the state of Canadian fantasy, science fiction, horror, etc<br />
-how does Canada inspire your work?<br />
-favourite Canadian settings to use in your writing</p>
<p>Of course, these topics are intended to be a jumping off point. Feel free to think outside of the box. And, above all, show your<br />
enthusiasm!</p>

<p>Occasionally, the EP staff reads more than slush and short stories. I picked up <a href="http://www.kyliechan.com/books.cfm?series=1&amp;book=1" target="_blank">White Tiger by Kylie Chan</a> at the Voyager party at WorldCon last month and have been eager to check it out. I study Southern Shao Lin kung fu and love stories that incorporate martial arts. I&#8217;m starting it today and will report back. (Yeah, it&#8217;s fantasy, I can be well balanced. I read both kinds of fiction, science fiction AND fantasy.*)</p>
<p>Recently finished books include The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman, The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins, and The Alchemist and the Executioness, linked novellas by Paolo Bacigalupi and Tobias Buckell. And I do realize that blogging these books will indicate which books I&#8217;m sorely behind on reading, but hey, we can&#8217;t read everything the moment it comes out, right?</p>
<p>(*Paraphrase of this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSZfUnCK5qk">The Blues Brothers classic line</a>.)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey, you sass that hoopy Douglas Adams. He was a frood who really knew where his towel was. And what the answer to the ultimate question was. </p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s the end of the day, but I&#8217;m getting in on time! 10/10/10 (today&#8217;s date) is 42 in binary, and any good geek knows that 42 is the answer to the ultimate question, the question of life, the universe, and everything. </p>
<p>Douglas Adams died far too early in 2001, and ever since there have been days to commemorate him, including National Towel Day (May 25). If, by odd chance you don&#8217;t know Adams&#8217; work, starting with the classic Hitchiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy, or, if you&#8217;re a fan of Norse gods or time travel, the Dirk Gently series is bizarre and wonderful. </p>
<p>Douglas became the symbolic pillar of seizing the day to me and my husband. Around 1998, we were at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta, GA, and he was there promoting Starship Titanic. As shy geeks, we huddled together whispering, &#8220;oh look it&#8217;s Douglas Adams, oh man, let&#8217;s go talk to him, he&#8217;s tall! I don&#8217;t know what to say, I&#8217;m too shy!&#8221; We walked through the convention center until we decided no, we were wusses, we had to turn around and go back and say hi. Who knew when we&#8217;d get a chance to see him again? </p>
<p>By the time we got back to the booth, he was gone, headed to the airport to go back to England. We expressed dismay, and the woman at the booth was incredibly kind and actually gave us a copy of the game to make it up to us. Three short years later, he was dead of a sudden heart attack, and to this day we kick ourselves for being too shy to even say hi to the man whose writing touched so many geeks of our generation.  </p>
<p>We miss you, Douglas. </p>

<p><em>&#8220;A takeover of your company with the state your market shares are in is not unreasonable.&#8221; Although Soaces was right, there&#8217;d be precious little profit, even after he&#8217;d liquidated all of Renewal&#8217;s assets and released the employees. But that wasn&#8217;t why he wanted it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to destroy us, aren&#8217;t you? Tear us apart and sell us to the highest bidder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s more to the company than the money. You&#8217;ll eliminate so many people&#8217;s livelihoods. Good people. Without Renewal, some of them won&#8217;t have any other alternatives.&#8221;</p>

"A takeover of your company with the state your market shares are in is not unreasonable." Although Soaces was right, there'd be precious little profit, even after he'd liquidated all of Renewal's assets and released the employees. But that wasn't why he wanted it.

"You're going to destroy us, aren't you? Tear us apart and sell us to the highest bidder."

"That's the plan."

"There's more to the company than the money. You'll eliminate so many people's livelihoods. Good people. Without Renewal, some of them won't have any other alternatives."

"Alternative to what? Luddite jobs? Machine labor?" He chose his next words, enunciating each syllable with relish. "It's all they're good for, isn't it? Can't have the un-teched getting above their station."

Portia dropped her gaze.  "I never said that."

"But you didn't deny it."

What you love about Escape Pod &#8211; free stories every Thursday &#8211; is not changing. At all. We&#8217;re not removing things as a change, we&#8217;re adding things.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi SF fans!</p>
<p>I wanted to talk about some changes that are happening here at Escape Pod.</p>
<p>First: DON&#8217;T PANIC. What you love about Escape Pod &#8211; free stories every Thursday &#8211; is not changing. At all. We&#8217;re not removing things as a change, we&#8217;re adding things.</p>
<p>Second: For a while, this site has been little more than a delivery device for the podcast. But now we&#8217;re going to add commentary, reviews, and news. We need help, though. If you&#8217;re interested in volunteering material for the blog, simply <a href="mailto:editor@escapepod.org" target="_blank">email me</a> and let me know what you&#8217;d like to contribute.</p>
<p>Third: <strong>Escape Pod is raising its rates. </strong> That&#8217;s right folks, we&#8217;re shooting for the stars and going for an SFWA pro rate format. We&#8217;ll be paying $.05 a word for new stories (maximum $300), $.03 a word for reprints (minimum $100). We&#8217;re doing this for a couple of reasons- authors deserve to be paid, of course. We&#8217;re hoping we can attract a greater caliber of authors, which will therefore grow our audience. Along with the rate increase, we&#8217;ll be asking for ebook rights to the stories so we can print them on our site, which will bring in a bigger audience. <strong>The rate increase will start with stories I accept after October 1, 2010. </strong><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>A side note- <strong>we&#8217;ll only be able to pay pro rates if the donations help us do so.</strong> we&#8217;re doing a six month trial; if our donations stay strong, it&#8217;ll be a permanent change for 2011, if they don&#8217;t, then in April we will drop back down to $100 a story. <strong>This depends on your support of the site.</strong></p>
<p>Alternately, if you&#8217;re a media publisher of any kind &#8212; television, movies, video games, a book seller, or just an indie author who wants to sponsor Escape Pod, that will help us out while also promoting you to tens of thousands of listeners.  You can email amanda at escapeartists.net for current rates and details.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some free fiction coming down from Escape Pod favorites:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><a href="http://craphound.com/?p=3082"><em>Jury Service</em>: By Cory Doctorow and Charlie Stross (audio only)</a></strong> &#8211; (from Cory&#8217;s blog)<em> Jury Service </em>is the first of two novellas Charlie Stross and I wrote about Huw, a technophobe stuck on Earth after the Singularity (the other one being <em>Appeals Court</em>). They are both being published, along with a third, yet-to-be-written novella <em>Parole Board </em>by Tor Books as R<em>apture of the Nerds</em>. We&#8217;re starting work on<em> Parole Board</em> in January, and to refamiliarize myself with the earlier novellas, I&#8217;m going to podcast both now (with the gracious permission of Charlie and our editor, Patrick Nielsen Hayden). Hope you enjoy &#8216;em &#8211; they&#8217;re as gonzo as I&#8217;ve ever gotten, I think! </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.timpratt.org/nex/?p=16" target="_blank"><strong><em>The Nex</em>: by Tim Pratt (text and ebook)</strong></a> &#8211; (from Tim&#8217;s blog) Unlike my other serials, this one isn’t an urban fantasy, and doesn’t take place in an existing series (though it does share a setting with a story, as I mentioned). It’s a novel narrated by a precocious 13-year-old who finds herself a long way from home with some disreputable people in a dangerous world. The book has shapeshifters, giant robots, aliens, kleptomaniacal monsters, heroism, shoplifting, terror, lecherous cyborgs, personable tyrants, steampunk submarines, subterranean tunnels, rustic French cuisine, a cult of teenage girls in fairy wings and leotards, teleportation, and people who get punched so hard they <em>disappear</em>. I hope you all like it. <em>[Ed- this is a free online book, so please support the author with a <a href="http://www.timpratt.org/nex/?page_id=2" target="_blank">donation</a> or a purchase of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0045JL56K" target="_blank">Kindle ebook</a>]</em></p>
<p>[<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>UPDATE</strong></span>- apologies, WordPress put the Doctorow file into our feed without me realizing, sorry for those of you who downloaded unwanted content. I've removed it, now you must right-click to download or go directly to Doctorow's page.]</p>

Introduction

It happens all the time: you're sitting in class, listening the best you can while Mister Waters goes on and on about atoms or sound waves or whatever, when suddenly you fall asleep. Your head lolls against your shoulder and some drool oozes from the side of your mouth. Luckily, Missy Woo kicks you in the knee to wake you up before someone notices, like Mister Waters or--worse--Austin. 

What's weird is that in those few minutes of sleeping, you dream like hours of stuff. You're all hanging out or playing basketball or walking the mall while everybody else is slowly raising their hands and taking notes. They all get twenty four hours that day, but you get a little extra.

But how much extra?

<p><em>&#8220;I know I can&#8217;t do anything about this&#8211;&#8221; she gestured toward the tangled blankets, the hospital bed, the pale walls. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve asked the doctors to take some cells&#8211;I still have a few healthy ones left, you know, and they&#8217;ll keep for some time&#8211;&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>I could guess the rest. But Susan, ever the biologist, had her lecture after all. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t work like that.&#8221; Her voice was gentle, as if she were speaking to one of her two sons, not to Mom. &#8220;A clone isn&#8217;t the same as the original. Your clone would be no more like you than&#8211;than one identical twin is like another. It wouldn&#8217;t be&#8211;&#8221; Susan&#8217;s voice caught. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be you.&#8221;</em></p>

"I know I can't do anything about this--" she gestured toward the tangled blankets, the hospital bed, the pale walls. "But I've asked the doctors to take some cells--I still have a few healthy ones left, you know, and they'll keep for some time--"

I could guess the rest. But Susan, ever the biologist, had her lecture after all. "It doesn't work like that." Her voice was gentle, as if she were speaking to one of her two sons, not to Mom. "A clone isn't the same as the original. Your clone would be no more like you than--than one identical twin is like another. It wouldn't be--" Susan's voice caught. "It wouldn't be you."

"You don't _know,_" Mom said. "None of the clones are old enough to ask yet. They're just babies." 

Rated G: Not for kids, but nothing to worry about if you listen around the kids.

"Laura," a speaker said, as though I hadn't been gone for six years, as though she'd seen me every day in between. "Laura, where is your uncle?"

I used to imagine her disintegrated, torn apart into silent atoms.

"It's not Laura anymore," I said. "It's Lolo. I'm gender neutral."

"I don't understand," she said.

"You've got a Net connection," I said. "Search around on "gender neutral" and "biomod operation."

I wasn't sure if the pause that came after that was for dramatic effect or whether she really was having trouble understanding the search parameters. Then she said, "Ah, I see. When did you do that?"

"Six years ago."

<p><em>As he puts the cruiser in gear and takes off, I calm down a little bit, and smell something that worries me. I smell Apurna on him, like always, but she doesn’t smell right. She smells of nervousness bordering on fear, and come to think of it, he does, too. It’s an old smell&#8211;I’d say from late yesterday evening, just after work&#8211;but it’s unmistakable. And there’s a hospital smell, and the smell of Apurna’s pain.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t say anything. Francisco doesn’t like me to pry.</p>
<p>But he took Apurna to the hospital.</p>

As he puts the cruiser in gear and takes off, I calm down a little bit, and smell something that worries me. I smell Apurna on him, like always, but she doesnrsquo;t smell right. She smells of nervousness bordering on fear, and come to think of it, he does, too. Itrsquo;s an old smell--Irsquo;d say from late yesterday evening, just after work--but itrsquo;s unmistakable. And therersquo;s a hospital smell, and the smell of Apurnarsquo;s pain.

I shouldnrsquo;t say anything. Francisco doesnrsquo;t like me to pry.

But he took Apurna to the hospital.

But he doesnrsquo;t like me to pry.

But he took Apurna to the hospital.

But he doesnrsquo;t like me to pry.

But--

ldquo;Whatrsquo;s wrong with Apurna?rdquo; I say.

Rated PG for minor police excitement.
