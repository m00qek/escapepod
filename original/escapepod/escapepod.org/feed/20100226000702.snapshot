<p>Narrated by Sarah Tolbert, Kate Baker, Nate Periat, and Steve Eley</p>

<p>The story first appeared in <em>Fast Ships, Black Sails</em> edited by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer.</p>

<p><em>You could feel their heat. Not a metaphor, I don&#8217;t mean that, I mean literally the room grew warmer when they were in it. They were both so powerful. Whenever Anne and Jack (they weren&#8217;t named that then, but that&#8217;s who they were) strolled into the room you got contact highs from their lust. People who would never make out would find excuses to go to the bathroom together and come back with monster hickies.

Narrated by Sarah Tolbert, Kate Baker, Nate Periat, and Steve Eley

The story first appeared in Fast Ships, Black Sails edited by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer.

You could feel their heat. Not a metaphor, I don't mean that, I mean literally the room grew warmer when they were in it. They were both so powerful. Whenever Anne and Jack (they weren't named that then, but that's who they were) strolled into the room you got contact highs from their lust. People who would never make out would find excuses to go to the bathroom together and come back with monster hickies. Everyone always wanted to sit near them because of their heat, and because they always said the thing you wish you'd said but only thought to say a billion blinks later.

When I first joined the Freebooter tech collective Anne and Jack were happy to have another girl in the group, but otherwise they ignored me. I could stare and stare at them all day long, hiding behind my black-rimmed glasses. But then one day Anne looked at me, and then Jack looked too, and we all just sort of fell toward each other. Like gravity. Like magic. Like there was a God.

This story originally appeared in Aeon #14.

The diner stood off the highway outside a small town optimistically called Hope. Hope was being stuck in the middle of the Northwest and wishing you were someplace, anyplace else. And Hope was also the name on the tag pinned to the dead woman in waitress uniforms that was currently lying against the wall inside the Barbie-Q Roadhouse. I had to stop myself from worrying at the connection: looking for patterns when sometimes there are none at all.

I wasn't worried about Hope (the waitress, not the town). I didn't get called down here for a murder: shit, murder is an honest-to-God American pastime. Just look at the statistics. No, I got called in because of the Marilyn.

The Marilyn was also dead. All in all, there were five dead people in the Barbie-Q: two waitresses; a balding man who ndash; from his bag full of cheaply-printed catalogues ndash; was some sort of a general salesman; the diner's manageress; and Marilyn. They had been shot by a machine gun, probably an Uzi. Marilyn's head left a red smear against the glass of the booth she sat in. She was there alone.

What the hell was a Marilyn doing out here?

Rated R for violence and language.

Editor's note:nbsp; this is a sequel to EP007.nbsp; Listen to it here.

Flies buzzed around the edges of the huge stone block, gathering at the rivulets of blood that ran down to the floor. A bit of what looked like it might be intestine hung off one corner, drawing special attention. It was a testament to the force of the collision that fragments of bone and tissue were scattered all the way down the passage, some even wedged in the carvings in the stone walls. Two men surveyed the scene with dismay.

"See? And this just keeps happening. It's getting so we can't get anything done around here," said the taller of the two, a grey-haired man with red eyes and a patchy beard.

The other man, younger but not precisely young, hauled himself up on top of the block and examined the mechanism. "This bar's been sliced right through." He looked back down at his client. "You say this was a poltergeist?"

The plan must have come to Rog fully formed that first morning, as he stepped off the elevator into the lobby of  Szilliken Sharpenwright and saw the old soldier newly stationed there in his omnichair between the potted  silk ferns and the coffee tables.

"Oh.  My.  God.  I am in love."

Megan, her arms loaded with Rog-House props and paraphernalia she hadnrsquo;t had time to ditch yet, said,  "You say that an awful lot for someone who styles himself completely asexual.  Not to mention atheistic."

<p><em>Jenny stands beside Eric, gazing south from the rising ground that yesterday was a fallow field.  Maybe the whole city hasn’t vanished.  Certainly the tall buildings are gone, Xerox Square and Lincoln Tower and the few others that just last night poked above the horizon, touched by the red fire of the setting September sun.  But, unlike Denver or Tokyo or Seattle, Rochester, New York sits – sat – on flat ground and there’s no point from which the whole city could be seen at once.  And it was such a small city.</em></p>

<p><em>“Maybe they only took downtown,” Jenny says to Eric, “and Penfield is still there or Gates or Brighton…”</em></p>

Certainly the tall buildings are gone, Xerox Square and Lincoln Tower and the few others that just last night poked above the horizon, touched by the red fire of the setting September sun.  But, unlike Denver or Tokyo or Seattle, Rochester, New York sits ndash; sat ndash; on flat ground and therersquo;s no point from which the whole city could be seen at once.

Violet snapped three photos of herself from various angles, sent them, and waited for her boyfriend's response. He rang her upmdash;a slow vibrating purr, unlike the staccato door-knocking of her mother's ringvibemdash;and said: "Me likey. Now take it off."

Violet frowned. "You were supposed to dig up the backstory on the dress."

"Well, you can't blame me for getting a little distracted. Besides, isn't it bad luck for me to see?"

"That's only for weddings, not prom."

Rated R for language, teen-adult situations, and virtual steadies. Also, Norm's sexy talk.

Narrated by Alasdair Stuart

Papa and Uncle Fomba told me if I didnrsquo;t join the army, theyrsquo;d kill me. They didnrsquo;t. They cut off my hands.

This was after U.S. forces marched on Syria, but before we invaded Lebanon. On every city block, posters of Uncle Sam entreated every Tom, Duc, and Haroun to get blown up in the name of freedom. Papa and Fomba gave me two weeks to enlist. I ran for Canada instead. They caught me.

Rated R for amputation fads.

When I met Skinhorse, my first thought was old.  Which was weird.  Nobody gets old these days.  We all die young, some of us after living a long time, if we're lucky.

He was in Piet's Number Seven, a bar-cum-caravanserai in an illegal orbit trailing far enough behind Vesta to be ignorable.  Piet's had been instantiated in an old volatiles bladder that had done the Jovian run a few too many times before falling into the surplus circuit.  You could store entire cities in Piet's cubage, which made for a somewhat attenuated bar experience.  Plus the place had one of those gravity cans -- yes, those gravity cans -- which meant your drink stayed stuck down long as you were near a Higgs carpet.

So there I was annoying myself with three perfectly disrespectable rock jocks, each of us out to fleece the others, when this cadaver starts to stand over me.  We're all forever young or forever dead, but this armstrong looked like he'd shaved about half a cent too deep across his whole body, then restored his dermis with spray-on thermal insulation.

Rated R for strong language, strong violence, and world-spanning tumors.

You can tell the British bluebell because the flowers are smaller, deeper blue, and they&#8217;re usually

There are safety signs around the factory. "Scrub Up." "Know Thyself." "Don't Blink." That last is the best piece of advice, here on the eyeball floor.

<p>Appeared originally in <em>From the Trenches</em></p>

<p><em>We set down in Pekoi as part of the organics inquisition team, still stinking of the last city. We&#8217;re all muscle. Not brains. The brains are out eating at the foreigners’ push downtown, and they don’t care if we whore around the tourist dregs half the night so long as somebody’s sober enough to haul them out come morning. When the brains aren’t eating, they’re pretending to give us directions in the field, telling us where to sniff out organics. They’re writing reports about
how dangerous Pekoi is to the civilized world.</em></p>

<p><em>We’re swapping off some boy in a backwater push the locals cleared out for us. We’re sitting around a low table. I pass off another card to Kep. Luce swaps out a suit. She has to sit on one leg to lean over the table. It’s hot in the low room, so humid that moths clutter aroundour feet, too heavy to fly.</em></p>

<p><em>The boy’s making little mewling sounds again. Somebody should shut him up, but not me. This is my hand. I’m ahead.</em></p>

Appeared originally in From the Trenches

We set down in Pekoi as part of the organics inquisition team, still stinking of the last city. We're all muscle. Not brains. The brains are out eating at the foreignersrsquo; push downtown, and they donrsquo;t care if we whore around the tourist dregs half the night so long as somebodyrsquo;s sober enough to haul them out come morning. When the brains arenrsquo;t eating, theyrsquo;re pretending to give us directions in the field, telling us where to sniff out organics. Theyrsquo;re writing reports about
how dangerous Pekoi is to the civilized world.

Wersquo;re swapping off some boy in a backwater push the locals cleared out for us. Wersquo;re sitting around a low table. I pass off another card to Kep. Luce swaps out a suit. She has to sit on one leg to lean over the table. Itrsquo;s hot in the low room, so humid that moths clutter aroundour feet, too heavy to fly.

The boyrsquo;s making little mewling sounds again. Somebody should shut him up, but not me. This is my hand. Irsquo;m ahead.

Rated R for violence and sexual situations.

"Buggerit, I don't have time for this," Joe muttered. The stable waiting for the small herd of cloned spidercows cluttering up the north paddock was still knee-deep in manure, and the tractor seat wasn't getting any warmer while he shivered out here waiting for Maddie to come and sort this thing out. It wasn't a big herd, but it was as big as his land and his labour could manage ndash; the big biofabricator in the shed could assemble mammalian livestock faster than he could feed them up and sell them with an honest HAND-RAISED NOT VAT-GROWN label.

"What do you want with us?" he yelled up at the gently buzzing farm.

"Brains, fresh brains for baby Jesus," crooned the farm in a warm contralto, startling Joe half out of his skin. "Buy my brains!" Half a dozen disturbing cauliflower shapes poked suggestively out of the farms' back then retracted again, coyly.

"Don't want no brains around here," Joe said stubbornly, his fingers whitening on the stock of the shotgun. "Don't want your kind round here, neither. Go away."

Rated PG for strong language, chemical violence, and drug-abusing dogs.

From acknowledged classics to forgotten gems we’ll be covering them all. Some of them you’ll have seen, some you won’t, some you’ll agree with me on and some you’ll wonder what I was drinking when I watched them but that’s half the fun. Spoilers abound so if you haven’t seen the movie and want to be surprised, go rent it now, we’ll be here when you get back.

A roan steer staggered around a concreted yard, its mute distress accompanied by clattering hooves and the fleshy slap of its thigh striking the ground when it fell. A new sound was introduced - incongruous, but familiar to Kevin's audience.

Whale song.

Gradually, the cow's shaking stilled, until it could stand securely. Its muscles continued to tremble, but not enough to upset its equilibrium while it listened.

Zhi 4's scream pierces the Siberian night. 



My spiked metal boots crunch through the snow as I race towards him, with Zhi 6 running at my side. The nanochip in my brainstem clicks on, and I reach out with my mind, but I can't sense even a trace of Zhi 4. A few seconds earlier his form had been outlined by the dark turquoise glow of the force field.



We stop twenty feet short of the field's perimeter. Beyond it, the hazy silhouette of the colossal Stalk looms, its millions of cilia undulating.


My bodysuit hums as it transmits data back to Xiang Xu Base, situated behind the Rusanov ice cap half a mile away.



My pulse flutters in anticipation and I take a deep breath to try to rein in my excitement. I -- like all Zhis -- have been designed with an insatiable curiosity about the Stalk's origins and vulnerabilities. Knowing I've been bred to feel this way doesn't make me feel it any less. Where did the Stalk come from? Why is it here? How can it thrive in these temperatures? I see the same questions reflected in Zhi 6's expression.

Rated PG-13 for cloning and some adult themes.
