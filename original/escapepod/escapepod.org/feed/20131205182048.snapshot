About the Author&#8230;
from the author&#8217;s website…
I began writing short fiction in 2010 after a long career as a music and radio industry columnist and journalist. The second story I wrote and the first one I published, “The Old Equations,” appeared in Lightspeed magazine and went on to be named a finalist for the Nebula Award and to be shortlisted for the StorySouth Million Writers and Theodore Sturgeon Memorial awards. I’ve subsequently been published in Fireside Magazine, Escape Pod, and the Unidentified Funny Objects anthology of humorous SF.
I graduated from Kenyon College with degrees in English and Psychology. Kenyon not only taught me a love of reading and literature that will always be a part of my soul, it also gave me unique opportunities to be a better writer. While at Kenyon, I studied under writer-in-residence Ursula K. Le Guin and Peruvian playwright Alonso Alegria. Both have been big influences on how I approach writing.
While I continue to write short fiction, I am currently working on my first novel.

Biographical Fragments of the Life of Julian Prince
by Jake Kerr
In the early twenty-first century, author Lesley Hauge wrote an essay entitled “we are what we leave behind” to little fanfare. In the wake of the Meyer Impact in 2023, amidst the coming to terms with the shock and loss, the essay was rediscovered and rose to prominence with a new understanding that all we may know about half the planet is what they left behind.
Literary giant Julian Prince examined what&#8211;and more importantly&#8211;who we left behind. So it is entirely appropriate to examine his own life the way he examined those of the millions that died on that fateful day in 2023, by what he left behind&#8211;the interviews, the articles, his own words, and the words of others.
These are the fragments that make up the whole.  For most of us that is all we have, and Prince knew that more than anyone.
So&#8230; Julian Prince&#8230;  Julian Samuel Prince.
He was born on March 18, 1989, and died on August 20, 2057.
Prince was an American novelist, essayist, journalist, and political activist. His best works are widely considered to be the post-Impact novels The Grey Sunset (published in 2027) and Rhythms of Decline (published in 2029), both of which won the Pulitzer Prize. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2031.
Prince was a pioneer of Impact Nihilism, a genre that embraced themes of helplessness and inevitable death in the aftermath of the Meyer Impact. His travelogue, Journey Into Hopelessness (published in 2026) outlined Prince’s return to North America, ostensibly to survey the damage to his home state of Texas. The book’s bleak and powerful language of loss and devastation influenced musicians, artists, and writers worldwide, giving voice to the genre as a counter to the rising wave of New Optimism, which sprang out of Europe as a response to the Meyer Impact and the enormous loss of life.
Not much is known of Prince’s early life. He spoke rarely of his childhood, and with the loss of life and destruction of records during the Meyer Impact, little source material remains. What is known is that Prince was an only child, the son of Margaret Prince (maiden name unknown) a[...]</itunes:summary>

Author Fredric Brown
About the Author&#8230;
taken front he wiki about the author here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Brown
Fredric Brown (October 29, 1906 – March 11, 1972) was an American science fiction and mystery writer. He was born in Cincinnati.
He is perhaps best known for his use of humor and for his mastery of the &#8220;short short&#8221; form—stories of 1 to 3 pages, often with ingenious plotting devices and surprise endings. Humor and a somewhat postmodern outlook carried over into his novels as well. One of his stories, &#8220;Arena,&#8221; is officially credited for an adaptation as an episode of the landmark television series, Star Trek.
About the Narrator&#8230;
Bill Bowman last read for us in episode 391. Bill started voice acting on the Metamor City Podcast, and has wanted to do more ever since. He spends his days working at a library, where he is in charge of all things with plugs and troubleshooting the people who use them. He spends his nights with his wife, two active children, and two overly active canines and all that goes with that.

About the Author&#8230;
from the author&#8217;s livejournal…
I live with my husband Brian (married nine whole years and counting!), his brother John and two adorable cats, in a 1930s neo-colonial that we unworthy slobs do not keep up.
I&#8217;m currently employed as the webmaster for the Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences at Case Western Reserve University.
My hobbies include writing, I&#8217;m a member of the Cajun Sushi Hamsters from Hell &#8211; a science fiction writer&#8217;s group. Officially &#8216;turned pro&#8217; last year and got a Nebula provisional ballot nomination to boot!
I&#8217;m also an avid member of the Society for Creative Anachronism.
I recently started playing football for the Cleveland Fusion, a women&#8217;s tackle football team.

Deshaun Stevens’ Ship Log
By Marie Vibbert
&#160;
Personal Log &#8212; January 1
Crunches&#8211;one and a very near half.
Push-ups&#8211;none unless counting getting off floor
Calories&#8211;lost count, but all from alcohol, so okay
One year ago today I vowed I would not spend another year working on this stupid cruise ship.  One year ago my life was exactly as it is now, with exception of having a girlfriend.
Trying to have a good sulk about lack of gf, but general suckatude of life winning.  Have spent all adult years&#8211;five of them&#8211;treading the same tract of “unexplored” space with end trip to rings of Neptune tacked on by tourist company as apology for boringness of unexplored space.  Have also set lighting and sound cues for thousand ungrateful musicians with combined talent of medium-sized shrub.
(Is supposedly new tract of space each time, but how can anyone&#8211;especially easily-duped passengers who think cruise ship bands are good&#8211;tell the difference?)
Current misery doubled by working with now-ex gf.  Attempts to avoid said ex at New Year’s party largely consisted of going back to punch bowl repeatedly.  May have sung love ballad composed in throes of self-pity at end of night. Memory foggy.  Hope everyone else’s is, too.
Suspecting ship regulation against alcohol v. wise after all.  Hope they don’t read our logs.
Resolutions:
1. Get New Job
2. Avoid romantic complications with Lido Deck Staff, especially boss, xgf, and cocktail waitresses with unfairly attractive hair.
3. Somehow, bearing number 2 in mind, get a new gf.
4. Exercise and update personal log every day
****
January 15
Crunches&#8211;45
Push-ups&#8211;10
Humiliation of “Love Ballad” finally wearing down due to co-workers not having infinite time to devote to re-watching video clip recorded by jerk supervisor.  Wish someone else would hurry up and do something embarrassing to capture Lido Deck attention.
New band contains certified hottie named Cyndee R.  Has body like type usually molded in plastic. Is utterly unlikely to notice mildly fit, intellectual, sadly single lighting and sound engineer, but hope springs eternal.
Have decided to shave beard and do 400 crunches every day.
****
January 16
Fifty is an acceptable number of crunches to do in one day.  Anything higher uncivilized and leads to back injury which prevents both successful completion of job and ability to impress Cyndee.
*****
January 22
Crunches&#8211;30
Push ups&#8211;25
Salisbury Steak Day lures me from monk-like asceticism engendered by hope of impressing hottie.  Must some day make pilgrimage to Salisbury.  Imagine fields of mushroom gravy v. picturesque.
Not too concerned about diet as have abs of steel&#8211;if steel is made of flabby pain.
Still no notice from Cyndee R, who has more talent than entire history of cruise ship performers and eyes that catch number five cerulean light beautifully.
*****
January 27
Crunches&#8211;50 (nearly)
Push-ups&#8211;25
Performances cancelled due to unforeseen Actual Interestin[...]</itunes:summary>

Berkeley, has worked as an applied mathematician at the Lawrence Livermore Lab, the Lawrence Berkeley Lab, and Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study, and has authored numerous articles in the applied mathematics and computational physics literature. Daniel then turned his attention to the private sector, where for the last 15 years, he has built and managed systems and software in a variety of problem domains and organizational settings.
About the Narrator&#8230;
Our narrator this week is Mr. Lee, who makes industrial music for fun, but not much money.  You can find his stuff by googling &#8220;love songs about hate&#8221;.

Bright Moment
by Daniel Marcus
Arun floated in the ammonia swells, one arm around the buoyant powersled, waiting. He&#8217;d blocked all his feeds and chats, public and private, and silenced his alerts. He felt deliciously alone. His ears were filled with the murmuring white noise of his own blood flow, intimate and oceanic, pulsing with his heartbeat. Metis was a bright diamond directly overhead. Athena hung just above the near, flat horizon, her rings a plaited bow spanning the purple sky. Persistent storms pocked her striated surface, appearing deceptively static from thirty kiloklicks out. Arun had negotiated the edgewalls of those storms more than once, setting up metahelium deep-mining rigs. A host of descriptive words came to mind, but &#8220;static&#8221; was not among them.
The sea undulated slowly in the low gee, about 0.6 Standard. The distant shape of a skyhook was traced out by a pearlstring of lights reaching up from the horizon and disappearing into distance haze, blinking in synchronization to suggest upwards motion. The skyhook was the only point of reference for scale. He shuddered involuntarily. His e-field distributed warmth to his body extremities from the tiny pack at the small of his back and maintained his blood oxygenation, but bobbing in the swell, alone in the vast sea, he felt cold and a little dizzy. He wanted to breathe and felt a fleeting instant of lizard-brain panic.
The current began to tug at his feet long before he saw the humped swell bowing the horizon upwards, a slight backward drift, accelerating slowly. His heart began beating faster as he clambered belly down onto the power sled. He drifted back towards the swell, slowly at first, then faster. He looked over his shoulder at the rising wall of liquid. It appeared solid, like moving metal, completely blocking the sky. He imagined he could feel wind tugging at his e-field.
Arun felt a vibration through the powersled, a vast low frequency murmur, the world-ocean getting ready to kick his ass. Just as he was about to be sucked beneath the monstrous swell, he activated the sled. He surged forward and stood as the sled began to accelerate up the face of the wave.
He felt the sled&#8217;s stabilizers groaning beneath his feet as he [...]</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>This quick episode is a round-up of the results of our recent Metacast to ask for subscriptions and donations hosted by Alasdair Stuart.
Thank you so much for the initial response to the problems at Escape Artists!
To review:
1. Escape Artists has a major cash problem. This has been caused by a massive increase in the amount of listeners which has not been accompanied by an increase in donations. In fact those have started to decrease. This situation is unsustainable and we will close at the end of 2013 without a major increase in subscriptions.
2. Click anywhere on this line for the original 44 minute meta-cast from all three shows explaining this.
3. We need money. There are two ways to do this either by donating or subscribing. One off donations are lovely and we’re incredibly grateful. Subscriptions cost you much less and raise our base level of funds on a monthly basis. Those are going to help much more in the mid term.
4. This is Escape Pod’s Homepage. Click on the DONATE or SUBSCRIBE buttons on the right hand side.
5. This is Pseudopod’s Homepage. Click on the DONATE or SUBSCRIBE buttons on the right hand side.
6. This is the Podcastle Homepage. Click on the DONATE or SUBSCRIBE buttons on the right hand side.

About the Author&#8230;
from the wiki about the author…
Esther Mona Friesner-Stutzman, née Friesner (born July 16, 1951) is a prolific American science fiction and fantasy author. She is best known for her humorous style of writing, both in the titles and the works themselves.
Friesner attended the Hunter College High School, a public magnet high school in New York City, as well as Vassar College. She holds a Ph.D. in Spanish and was a college professor at Yale University before becoming a writer.
In addition to short stories, Friesner has published a number of novels and is a prolific editor of anthologies. Among her recent books are Nobody&#8217;s Princess, which takes the Greek legend of Helen of Sparta and gives it a new beginning, and its sequel, Nobody&#8217;s Prize. She is a frequent guest of honor at science fiction conventions, having appeared at Bubonicon, Arisia, Boskone, Baycon and Albacon in the 1990s and into the 21st century.
Friesner is credited as one of the founders of a parody movement in the 1980s called cyberprep.
Friesner was named Outstanding New Fantasy Writer by Romantic Times in 1986. She won the Skylark Award in 1994. She has been nominated a number of times for the Hugo and Nebula awards, winning the Nebula Award for Best Short Story in 1995 and 1996 for, respectively, &#8220;Death and the Librarian&#8221; and &#8220;A Birth Day&#8221;.

About the Author&#8230;
from the wiki about the author… From 1946-49, Reynolds worked as a national organizer for the SLP. In 1946, he made his first fiction sale, “What is Courage?”, to Esquire magazine. A year later, he met a woman who shared his radical politics, Helen Jeanette Wooley. They were married in September of 1947, and Jeanette agreed to support Reynolds for two years while he pursued a career as a writer for the detective pulps. After searching for a place with a low cost of living, they moved to Taos, New Mexico, where Reynolds met science fiction writers Walt Sheldon and Fredric Brown. Brown, later one of Reynolds’ frequent collaborators, convinced Reynolds to shift from writing detective stories to writing science fiction. Reynolds’ first sale of a science fiction story, “Last Warning” (also known as &#8220;The Galactic Ghost&#8221;), sold to Planet Stories in June 1949 but was not printed until 1954. His first published science fiction story, “Isolationist” appeared in Fantastic Adventures in June of 1950.[3] His career soon took off, resulting in a sale of 18 stories in 1950 alone.[1] In 1951, he published his first novel, The Case of the Little Green Men, a mix of the murder-mystery and science fiction genres that became &#8220;an instant classic of science-fiction-fan related fiction.&#8221;
About the Narrator&#8230;
Corson loves audio drama, dramatic readings, everything BBC 4 produces, SF, fantasy, horror, and tropical beaches.  (He doesn&#8217;t like Pina Coladas, but vodka straight up, turns him on.)  Corson works as a professional voice artist in a variety of fields but (occasionally) moonlights as a techncial writer or a French-to-English technical translator.  His website is HCBVoice.com but he is astonished and proud to be also listed as an actor on the IMDB website and also proud to give his time whenever possible to Escape Artists!  Quote: &#8220;Contribute to EA guys!&#8221;

Expediter
by Mack Reynolds
His assignment was to get things done;
he definitely did so.
Not quite the things intended, perhaps,
but definitely done.
*       *       *       *       *
The knock at the door came in the middle of the night, as Josip Pekic had always thought it would. He had been but four years of age when the knock had come that first time and the three large men had given his father a matter of only minutes to dress and accompany them. He could barely remember his father.
The days of the police state were over, so they told you. The cult of the personality was a thing of the past. The long series of five-year plans and seven-year plans were over and all the goals had been achieved. The new constitution guaranteed personal liberties. No longer were you subject to police brutality at the merest whim. So they told you.
But fears die hard, particularly when they are largely of the subconscious. And he had always, deep within, expected the knock.
He was not mistaken. The rap came again, abrupt, impatient. Josip Pekic allowed himself but one chill of apprehension, then rolled from his bed, squared slightly stooped shoulders, and made his way to the door. He flicked on the light and opened up, even as the burly, empty faced zombi there was preparing to pound still again.
There were two of them, not three as he had always dreamed. As three had come for his father, more than two decades before.
His father had been a rightist deviationist, so the papers had said, a follower of one of whom Josip had never heard in any other context other than his father&#8217;s trial and later execution. But he had not cracked under whatever pressures had been exerted upon him, and of that his son was proud.
He had not cracked, and in later years, when the cult of [...]</itunes:summary>

The Dala Horse
by Michael Swanwick
Something terrible had happened. Linnea did not know what it was. But her father had looked pale and worried, and her mother had told her, very fiercely, “Be brave!” and now she had to leave, and it was all the result of that terrible thing.
The three of them lived in a red wooden house with steep black roofs by the edge of the forest. From the window of her attic room, Linnea could see a small lake silver with ice very far away. The design of the house was unchanged from all the way back in the days of the Coffin People, who buried their kind in beautiful polished boxes with metal fittings like nothing anyone made anymore. Uncle Olaf made a living hunting down their coffin-sites and salvaging the metal from them. He wore a necklace of gold rings he had found, tied together with silver wire.
“Don’t go near any roads,” her father had said. “Especially the old ones.” He’d given her a map. “This will help you find your grandmother’s house.”
“Mor-Mor?”
“No, Far-Mor. My mother. In Godastor.”
Godastor was a small settlement on the other side of the mountain. Linnea had no idea how to get there. But the map would tell her.
Her mother gave her a little knapsack stuffed with food, and a quick hug. She shoved something deep in the pocket of Linnea’s coat and said, “Now go! Before it comes!”
“Good-bye, Mor and Far,” Linnea had said formally, and bowed.
Then she’d left.
So it was that Linnea found herself walking up a long, snowy slope, straight up the side of the mountain. It was tiring work, but she was a dutiful little girl. The weather was harsh, but whenever she started getting cold, she just turned up the temperature of her coat. At the top of the slope she came across a path, barely wide enough for one person, and so she followed it onward. It did not occur to her that this might be one of the roads her father had warned her against. She did not wonder at the fact that it was completely bare of snow.
After a while, though, Linnea began to grow tired. So she took off her knapsack and dropped it in the snow alongside the[...]</itunes:summary>

Southpaw
by Bruce McAllister
Eventually New York Giants’ scout Alex Pompez got the authorization from their front office to offer Castro a contact. After several days of deliberation with friends, family, and some of his professors, Castro turned down the offer. The Giants’ officials were stunned. “No one had ever turned us down from Latin America before,” recalled Pompez. “Castro said no, but in his very polite way. He was really a very nice kid. . . .”—J. David Truby, Sports History, November 1988
&#160;
Fidel stands on the pitcher’s mound, dazed. For an instant he doesn’t know where he is. It is a pitcher’s mound. It is a baseball diamond, and there is a woman—the woman he loves—out there in the stands with her beautiful blonde hair and her very American name waving to him, because she loves him, too. It is July. He is sure of this. It is ’51 or ’52. He cannot remember which. But the crowd is as big as ever and he can smell the leather of his glove, and he knows he is playing baseball—the way, as a child in the sugarcane fields of Oriente Province, he always dreamed he might.
&#160;
His fastball is a problem, but he throws one anyway, it breaks wide and the ump calls the ball. He throws a curve this time, a fine one, and it’s a strike—the third. He grins at Westrum, his catcher, his friend. The next batter’s up. Fidel feels an itching on his face and reaches up to scratch it. It feels like the beginning of a beard, but that can’t be. You keep a clean face in baseball. He tried to tell his father that, in Oriente, the last time he went home, but the old man, as always, had just argued.
He delivers another curve—with great control—and smiles when the ball drops off the table and Sterling swings like an idiot. He muscles up on the pitch, blows the batter down with a heater, but Williams gets a double off the next slider, Miller clears the bases with a triple, and they bring Wilhelm in to relieve him at last. The final score is 9 to 4, just like the oddsmakers predicted, and that great centerfielder Mays still won’t look at him in the lockers.
&#160;
Nancy—her name is Nancy—is waiting for him at the back entrance when he’s in his street clothes again, the flowered shirt and the white ducks he likes best, and she looks wonderful. She’s chewing gum, which drives him craz[...]</itunes:summary>

On the Big Fisted Circuit
 by Cat Rambo
Jane counted them again to make sure: twelve.
Twelve signatures on the back panel, most jerky with haste, a couple deliberate and firm, one with a little flower above the i, for god&#8217;s sake. The pen in her hand ready to add the thirteenth.
How blatant were they going to be?
This was the biggest suit she&#8217;d ever crawled into. It meant money: money dripping through the wires around her, money in the gleaming metal struts, money being made by every step it took, money her family needed, every step a week&#8217;s rent and food if they were careful with it.
She&#8217;d never hit a thirteenth signature before. Most rigs, even the monster ones like this, got destroyed long before a thirteenth fight. It wasn&#8217;t just the bad luck, it was dealing with machinery that had been damaged and repaired, damaged and repaired, until you didn&#8217;t know what was original body and what was filler.
The sound of the crowd filtered into the suit. Most were screaming, &#8220;Coke! Coke! Coke!&#8221; as though they meant blood instead, shouts thrumming through the five railroad cars&#8217; worth of metal surrounding her.
Everyone knew what happened in a rig&#8217;s thirteenth fight. Sure, not every time, if a fighter had enough mojo to overcome the bad luck. But who needed to ride odds like that in a fight? Plenty to think about then without having to listen for the black cat&#8217;s squawl.
Unless you&#8217;d already closed your ears to the sound, choosing to listen to cash&#8217;s siren song.
&#8220;Everything okay?&#8221; Herk poked his head into the interior, but came no further. Day of a fight, the suit&#8217;s wearer didn&#8217;t really want anyone else in the control cavity, the suit&#8217;s heart, even with the struts retracted so there was enough room for a couple of people to wiggle around.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a thirteenth,&#8221; she said.
Her mechanic paused. The red and green and blue of the interior lights played over Herkimer Smith&#8217;s face, scarred with sparks and the blow that had ended his own career. Jane had figured Herk wanted her to succeed, but it couldn&#8217;t feel all that fine, seeing someone brushing past you on the path you&#8217;d figured you&#8217;d be treading.
And that blow had come while wearing a suit in its thirteenth battle, fighting for a breakfast cereal they didn&#8217;t make anymore.
&#8220;You want out?&#8221; Herk finally said.
&#8220;Not an option,&#8221; Jane said, her voice as flat as a past-due bill&#8217;s red f[...]</itunes:summary>

The Nightmare Lights of Mars
by Brian Trent
Before discovering the moths, Clarissa Lang stumbled blind in the Martian sandstorm and admitted she was about to die because of a painting.
Granules of sand flew past her head at 90 kph and crunched between her teeth. The storm hissed around her ears, a terrible insistence that she hush forever. There was no excuse for this death, Clarissa thought. Weather advisories had been in place for an hour. Her death would become a digital footnote, filed under foolishness, for all time.
She staggered blind and tacked through the needle-spray. Red sand piled around her neck and shoulders, grew around her mouth like exaggerated lipstick.
“Overlay!” she shouted — tried to shout — but her mouth instantly filled with gritty particulate. She panicked then, the first moment of true mindless panic. But the Martian Positioning Satellite had heard her cry: Maureen’s property map sprang up in her left eye, drawn scarlet against each blink.
The house was thirty meters northwest. Upwind.
Clarissa tucked herself into a protective ball and scuttled sideways, like a crab. The sand struck her exposed hands and face in a shifting, relentless wave.
_I’ll never make it._
Clarissa could no longer breathe. A recent story from the Japanese colony in Cydonia leapt to her mind, in which a grandmother had been caught outside in a sandstorm, wandered around in circles for ten minutes in the hissing tempest, and finally suffocated _an arm’s length from her front door._ When they found her, her stomach, throat, and mouth were bulging with sand.
The toolshed! I can make the tool shed!
Clarissa turned away from her house and the full brunt of the sandstorm slammed into her back, tearing the jacket, spraying around her body in silhouette. For a fleeting instant, she was able to suck clean air into her lungs. Then the sand closed around her again.

She ran downwind, following the MPS overlay, and tripped over a tree-stump â€“ all that remained of the maple her wife had heat-lanced a week ago. Clarissa fell and rolled, her face briefly showered in needle-spray, and then she was on her feet again, running, weeping, not looking back.
In three bounds she was at the shed. She grabbed the door handle and pulled.  It was locked. The shed was slotted to Maureen’s biometrics. Clarissa pounded the door furiously.
There was only one chance left. She felt along the shed walls and reached the back as a muddy, bloody figure. With the last reserves of wild strength, she battered herself against the window. The glasstic was shatter-proof, but it popped from its molding and she fell atop its reflective surface, safe and shivering in the shed.
Musty air filled her lungs. Maureen’s tools hung like hunting trophies on the walls.
Clarissa weakly felt for the box of algae flares, pried the lid up, and struck it against the glass sheet beneath her. The shed blazed in bright emerald l[...]</itunes:summary>

About the Author&#8230;




from Amazon.com&#8230; A screenwriter, novelist, and the award-winning author of over one hundred short stories, Matt spent a decade traveling the western hemisphere as a professional wrestler and combat instructor before retiring to write full-time. He now resides in Los Angeles and bleeds exclusively on the blank page.
He has no actual knowledge of the answer to life, the universe, and everything. But he makes sure to ask every demon he meets, just in case.

Knowing 
by Matt Wallace
A grey pallor hung heavy over the landscape. Heaven’s fire had long gone out, leaving the sky a cold hearth. The ashen soot that covered it might once have been the burning ember of eons, but now its livid color irradiated the early dawn. It soaked every molecule of air like a pale leaden necrosis, existing independently of the season, fostering neither cold nor heat.
A caravan of old cars rambled through the grey morning, balding tires rolling over the broken disrepair of State Highway 24. Chrysler Imperials and winged hatchback Newports, Chevy Chevelles and Novas and flatbed El Caminos, Dodge Darts and Coronets, Ford Fairlanes and Falcons, Lincoln Comets and Continentals, Olds Eighty-Eights and Cutlass Supremes; early 1960’s vintages, all. They traveled toward Oneonta, the Northern New York town whose name was taken from the Iroquois word for a place of meeting.
The Earth’s reclamation of its wilderness in post-nuclear North America continued. Lush foliage blurred as the cars headed deep into the rural upstate, creating rich green wraiths in their murky windows that danced and swooped and curved. The lead car, a Dodge Charger that outshined the rest by miles, would reach Gilboa around breakfast time.
There the wind blew warm through the world’s oldest forest. There they’d been called.
There they’d find the Answer.
~
The demon’s name was Malphas, and he cursed them all in a foul stream of half-a-dozen dead and dying languages. His voice sounded like strands of steel wool being pulled through intestines. After a treatise in multi-lingual blasphemy that lasted almost half-an-hour, he began speaking to them in English.
“Pig-fucking whore masters of a Gomorrhan slum! Corroded cock-peeling corpus cavernosum! Your libation is the sour milk of hermaphroditic mares!”
He struggled against the meaty, Kevlar-wrapped footmen holding him to the base of the fossil tree, but earthbound demons are among the frailest of creatures. His milky, ink-veined arms looked utterly childlike encircled in the gloved hands of his captors.
“You stimulate hemorrhoid-ridden goat ani with fingertips dipped in placenta butter! The cur tongues of your mothers are the mercy strummers of harpy clitorides!”
They’d unearthed Malphas some time before noon. Maxon’s crew were hours splitting the bark of the forest’s ancient inhabitants, cracking the trunks where demons made their homes. They liked the old things, the decaying things.
Father Kilbride mixed tea with a porcelain travel kit he kept tucked away under the shoulder cape of his Catholic priest’s cassock. “Corpus cavernosum?” the Irish priest asked the assemblage at large, absently.
Most of his concentration was aimed at sprinkling petrified leaves the color of jaundiced flesh into a doll-sized cup.
“In males the corpus cavernosum is spongy erectile tissue that functions as capillaries during the arousal process,” Meta explained.
Father Kilbride nodded, only half-hearing. His swollen, liver spotted hands shook as they attempted to manipulate the dried tealeaves. They did not simply shake; they were wracked with junkie tremors. Into the miniaturized teacup he poured water from a heated thermos. Ghostly fingers of steam curled up as it hit the leaves. Instead of sugar cubes, Kilbrid[...]</itunes:summary>

About the Author&#8230;




from Amazon.com&#8230; I&#8217;ve been writing fantasy for thirty years&#8230; no, my fantasy&#8217;s been published for thirty years. I&#8217;ve been writing it since I was eight. It&#8217;s what I always wanted to do for a living, and I&#8217;ve been very fortunate in that I&#8217;ve been able to manage that. I try to write fantasy with an element of common sense to it &#8212; not so much mythic archetypes as sensible people.
Other than my job, my life&#8217;s pretty ordinary &#8212; a nice house in a quiet neighborhood, a wife, two grown kids, and an overweight cat.




About the Narrator&#8230;
Jonathon Hawkins is a public school teacher in Madison, Wisconsin, where he spent a decade or so introducing Greek and Norse myth to middle-schoolers. Now teaching computer tech, he&#8217;s reading here to keep in practice until his toddler and new infant are ready to hear all about Loki, Artemis, and Papa Cthulhu.

Why I Left Harry&#8217;s All-Night Hamburgers 
by Lawrence Watt-Evans
Harry&#8217;s was a nice place &#8212; probably still is. I haven&#8217;t been back lately. It&#8217;s a couple of miles off I-79, a few exits north of Charleston, near a place called Sutton. Used to do a pretty fair amount of business until they finished building the Interstate out from Charleston and made it worthwhile for some fast-food joints to move in right next to the cloverleaf; nobody wanted to drive the extra miles to Harry&#8217;s after that. Folks
used to wonder how old Harry stayed in business, as a matter of fact, but he did all right even without the Interstate trade. I found that out when I worked there.
Why did I work there, instead of at one of the fast-food joints? Because my folks lived in a little house just around the corner from Harry&#8217;s, out in the middle of nowhere &#8212; not in Sutton itself, just out there on the road. Wasn&#8217;t anything around except our house and Harry&#8217;s place. He lived out back of his restaurant. That was about the only thing I could walk to in under an hour, and I didn&#8217;t have a car.
This was when I was sixteen. I needed a job, because my dad was out of work again and if I was gonna do anything I needed my own money. Mom didn&#8217;t mind my using her car &#8212; so long as it came back with a full tank of gas and I didn&#8217;t keep it too long. That was the rule. So I needed some work, and Harry&#8217;s All-Night Hamburgers was the only thing within walking distance. Harry said he had all the help he needed &#8212; two cooks and two people working the counter, besides himself. The others worked days, two to a shift, and Harry did the late night stretch all by himself. I hung out there a little, since I didn&#8217;t have anywhere else, and it looked like pretty easy work &#8212; there was hardly any business, and those guys mostly sat around telling dirty jokes. So I figured it was perfect.
Harry, though, said that he didn&#8217;t need any help.
I figured that was probably true, but I wasn&#8217;t going to let logic keep me out of driving my mother&#8217;s car. I did some serious begging, and after I&#8217;d made his life miserable for a week or two Harry said he&#8217;d take a chance and give me a shot, working the graveyard shift, midnight to eight A.M., as his counterman, busboy, and janitor all in one.
I talked him down to 7:30, so I could still get to school, and we had us a deal. I didn&#8217;t care about school so much myself, but my parents wanted me to go, and it was a good place to see my friends, y&#8217;know? Meet girls and so on.
So I started working at Harry&#8217;s, nights. I showed up at midnight the first night, and Harry gave me an apron and a little hat, like something from a diner in an old movie, same a[...]</itunes:summary>

Thirty Seconds from Now
by John Chu
One second from now, the bean bag will thunk into Scott&#8217;s left palm. From reflex, his fingers will wrap around it before he&#8217;ll toss it back up again. The trick of juggling lies not in the catch but in the toss. The bean bag will arc up from his right hand, but Scott sees his left hand blur now. Phantom left hands at the few places his left hand may be one second from now overlap with each other, and with his real left hand about a foot above the cold tile floor he&#8217;s sitting on. The same holds for the phantom bean bags. They overlap each other and the result looks nearly as cubic, red, and solid in the air, stark against the dorm room&#8217;s blank walls, as the bean bag does right now resting in Scott&#8217;s right hand.
He&#8217;s making a good toss. This catch will be easy. His three bean bag cascade looks to him the way he imagines it must look to anyone else, well, if they were near-sighted and missing their glasses.
When he makes a bad toss, translucent Scotts scatter across the room. They reach for the beds on either side of him, lunge for his or his roommate&#8217;s desk, and dive over his bed for the closet. They all stretch for the myriad translucent bean bags raining from the stucco ceiling. The bean bags threaten to knock over the desk lamps, bury themselves in the acting textbooks that line his closet shelf and smack against the window blinds. A desperate enough toss and a phantom bean bag may fly through the doorway into the hall.
He does not need his time-skewed senses to know he will eventually make a bad toss. As hard as he tries to keep his sight solid, to make his life predictable, he will drop a bean bag. That&#8217;s why he&#8217;s sitting on the floor. It&#8217;s easier to pick up dropped bean bags that way.
#
Five seconds from now, someone will walk past the open door of his dorm room. Scott doesn&#8217;t recognize him. He&#8217;s just arrived at the university and can barely recognize his roommate, a long-haired rail of a man who left him to eat breakfast in the basement cafeteria. The man who will walk past the door is about the same height as the bulletin board across from Scott&#8217;s room. His thick body will block what he&#8217;s posting from view. His dark hair will lie on his head like a mane. Looking at the man&#8217;s back, Scott sees a rounded teddy bear quality to him. What attracts Scott, though, is the man&#8217;s clarity.
Scott can read the man&#8217;s t-shirt. It lists films the Department of Media Studies screened at a festival this past summer. Five distinct fingers will splay to hold his flyer in place as the other hand pushes pins into the cork. His actions show none of the uncertainty, the blurriness that everyone else&#8217;s shows. It&#8217;s been years since anyone has looked so clear to him.
The future is messy. Scott&#8217;s senses feed him all possible f[...]</itunes:summary>

Loss, with Chalk Diagrams
by E. Lily Yu
Never before in her life had Rebekah Moss turned to the rewirers, not as a tight-mouthed girl eavesdropping by closed doors on her parents’ iceberg drift toward divorce, nor after she heard with bowed head, her body as blushingly full as a magnolia bud, the doctor describing the scars that kept her from having Dom’s child. She took few risks and accepted all outcomes with equanimity. But when her old friend Linda was found beneath a park bridge in Quebec with her wrists slit lengthwise to the bone, leaving no note, no whisper of explanation, she hesitated only a moment before linking to the rewiring center. Saturday next was the first available appointment, a silvery voice informed her, and she took it. When she ended the call she wrapped her arms around her legs and tilted back and forth, blinking hard, her own breathing a foil rustle in her ears.
She had been twelve years old when rewiring was first approved for use on a limited clinical population. The treatment involved a brew of sixteen neurotoxins finely tuned to leave normal motor, memory, and cognitive processes intact, burning out only those neural pathways associated with grief and trauma. It was recognized as a radical advancement in medicine, and the neuroscientists involved in its development had been decorated with medals, presidential visits, and a research foundation in their names.
Her family supported her choice, of course. They pressed lemon tea and tissues and bitter chocolate upon her while she stumbled through the week, her whole world gone faint and gray and narrow. The sky seemed always clouded over, though she knew there was sunlight. She could not eat by herself. Dom fed her soup by hand and patted her rather awkwardly as she sobbed, both of them embarrassed by her access of sorrow. It was the only time in their marriage that she had cried&#8230;

About the Author&#8230;

Jeffrey Wikstrom is a writer, registered patent agent, gamer, PhD chemist, and nerdly hobbyist.  This blog consists of material written on these interests and things relating to them; lately it’s mostly King Arthur.  After growing up in Arkansas and the Gulf Coast, he went to school in Boston and now lives in Wilmington DE, in a house he shares with his wife and their dogs.



About the Narrator&#8230;

I’ve worked as a magician, a rally marshal, a secretary, the world’s politest bouncer, and the manager of a comic/game store.   I’m now a freelance journalist, editor and podcaster and write regularly for SFX, Bleeding Cool, How It Works, Neo and Comic Heroes. I edit  Hub magazine (www.hubfiction.com), a free weekly PDF magazine covering science fiction, fantasy and horror with 10,000 readers that’s relaunching shortly and I host  Pseudopod (www.pseudopod.org), the weekly horror ficton podcast.

Nutshell
by Jeffrey Wikstrom

Carpet ocean, stretching over miles; hills and valleys and ravines, all upholstered.  The green indoor-outdoor gives way to blue, as land gives way to sea, but the texture never changes.  When it rains, as it sometimes does, the drops pass through the carpet without making contact, as though they or it aren&#8217;t really there.  It&#8217;s there enough for me to walk on, at least, though spongy in some places and firm in others, as though it conceals hidden frames or foundations.  Out on the blue carpet-sea, it feels stretched, tight, as though I walk on a drumhead.  Maybe if I cracked it open I would find a vast dark expanse of water, lit by undersea jack-o-lanterns and holes that show the sky without breaking up the carpet-underside ceiling.
None of it is real, of course.  That probably goes without saying.
It&#8217;s funny; I wasn&#8217;t supposed to experience time at all.  When they loaded us into the ship, we were told that the travel would be instantaneous from our perspectives.  One minute lying down in the big white plastic tombs, the next freshly decanted and opening raw new eyes.  We would transition seamlessly from fluorescents and anesthesia to the light of some distant new sun.  Certainly I have no memory of consciousness during departure.  I wouldn&#8217;t have wanted to be aware, during that dreadful acceleration which pulped our bones, and wrecked our flesh.  By then they had already guided us from our old bodies into the safety of simulation and storage.
This curated world never bruises me or shows me sharp edges.  Trees are padded poles, slick vinyl trunks capped by rubbery green spheres fifteen, twenty feet up.  Stairsteps run up the hillsides, though even the steepest rises are shallow enough I don&#8217;t really need the footholds.  Fat plush toys, pink and green and blue, gambol across the plains and mimic living beasts grazing carpet-grass, or drinking from carpet-brooks.  They ignore me, even when I shove or punch them.
Do I dream?  In dreaming, should I question my dream?  Should I feel some continuity of experience?  I can loop around, circle back and pass the same stand of vinyl tree-sculptures four times without noticing any discrepancies. Do I simply lack a capacity to recognize breaches of continuity?  Was that cottage always there?
I think it wasn&#8217;t.  Still, it&#8217;s mine, and not unwelcome.  I know it. I don&#8217;t fear it.  A woolen cube, windowed and doored, with a taut wedge of canvas for a roof.  I press my hand into the salmon-colored exterior wall.  It sinks in a half-inch, and leaves a deep handprint that faded slowly.  The flannel texture of the wall exactly matches a blanket I remember from childhood, one just that shade of pink.
The vast hall within stretches far too large to fit in that flannel cube exterior.   I step ont[...]</itunes:summary>

Mantis Wives
by Kij Johnson
&#8220;As for the insects, their lives are sustained only by intricate processes of fantastic horror.&#8221; —John Wyndham.
Eventually, the mantis women discovered that killing their husbands was not inseparable from the getting of young. Before this, a wife devoured her lover piece by piece during the act of coition: the head (and its shining eyes going dim as she ate); the long green prothorax; the forelegs crisp as straws; the bitter wings. She left for last the metathorax and its pumping legs, the abdomen, and finally the phallus. Mantis women needed nutrients for their pregnancies; their lovers offered this as well as their seed.
It was believed that mantis men would resist their deaths if permitted to choose the manner of their mating; but the women learned to turn elsewhere for nutrients after draining their husbands&#8217; members, and yet the men lingered. And so their ladies continued to kill them, but slowly, in the fashioning of difficult arts. What else could there be between them?
The Bitter Edge: A wife may cut through her husband&#8217;s exoskeletal plates, each layer a different pattern, so that to look at a man is to see shining, hard brocade. At the deepest level are visible pieces of his core, the hint of internal parts bleeding out. He may suggest shapes.
The Eccentric Curve of His Thoughts: A wife may drill the tiniest hole into her lover&#8217;s head and insert a fine hair. She presses carefully, striving for specific results: a seizure, a novel pheromone burst, a dance that ends in self-castration. If she replaces the hair with a wasp&#8217;s narrow syringing stinger, she may blow air bubbles into his head and then he will react unpredictably. There is otherwise little he may do that will surprise her, or himself.
What is the art of the men, that they remain to die at the hands of their wives? What is the art of the wives, that they kill?
The Strength of Weight: Removing his wings, she leads him into the paths of ants.
Unready Jewels: A mantis wife may walk with her husband across the trunks of pines, until they come to a trail of sap and ascend to an insect-clustered wound. Staying to the side, she presses him down until his legs stick fast. He may grow restless as the sap sheathes his body and wings. His eyes may not dim for some time. Smaller insects may cluster upon his honeyed body like ornaments.
A mantis woman does not know why the men crave death, but she does not ask. Does she fear resistance? Does she hope for it? She has forgotten the ancient reasons for her acts, but in any case[...]</itunes:summary>

About the Author&#8230;


Aliette de Bodard is an award-winning speculative fiction writer. She is of French/Vietnamese descent, born in the USA, and grew up in Paris. French is her mother-tongue, but she writes in English.
She studied in Paris in a prep course for the competitive exams which would enable her to enter an engineering school. After two years of intensive classes, Aliette was admitted into Ecole Polytechnique, one of France’s top engineering schools. During her class préparatoire, she started writing regularly, which enabled her to find a distraction from science. She completed two novels during her studies.
Halfway through Ecole Polytechnique, she started writing short stories instead of novels, in order to improve faster–and went on writing those after she graduated.
In June 2006, Aliette attended Orson Scott Card’s Literary Bootcamp, which enabled her to sharpen her skills, as well as come back with a wealth of information about the craft and the business of writing.
Her writing took off after she won the Writers of the Future contest and got picked out of Interzone‘s slushpile by the inimitable Jetse de Vries; this marked the beginning of a growing number of sales, out of which several were made to semi-professional or professional markets. She was able to join SFWA as an Active Member in 2008, and became a finalist for the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in 2009, narrowly losing to David Anthony Durham.
Her first novel, Servant of the Underworld sold to HarperCollins imprint Angry Robot following a lucky break involving an agent, an editor and a delayed flight (see full story here at the Angry Robot website).



About the Narrator&#8230;

Amy Robinson is a trained professional voice actress. After spending years doing amateur theatre and countless hours creating back stories and unique voices for each D&#38;D character she rolled up while playing with friends, she decided it was time to take the leap into professional acting. She sought out further voiceover training with experts and agents alike, and continues to sharpen her skills by attending workshops with industry pros like Rob Paulsen (Yakko Warner and Pinky from Pinky and the Brain) and Bob Bergen (Porky Pig). She has voiced several hidden object games for European game company, Artifex Mundi, including both of the &#8220;Nightmares From The Deep&#8221; titles, and numerous commercials, and e-learning projects as well.

Immersion
by Aliette de Bodard
In the morning, you&#8217;re no longer quite sure who you are.
You stand in front of the mirror&#8211;it shifts and trembles, reflecting only what you want to see&#8211;eyes that feel too wide, skin that feels too pale, an odd, distant smell wafting from the compartment&#8217;s ambient system that is neither incense nor garlic, but something else, something elusive that you once knew.
You&#8217;re dressed, already&#8211;not on your skin, but outside, where it matters, your avatar sporting blue and black and gold, the stylish clothes of a well-traveled, well-connected woman. For a moment, as you turn away from the mirror, the glass shimmers out of focus; and another woman in a dull silk gown stares back at you: smaller, squatter and in every way diminished&#8211;a stranger, a distant memory that has ceased to have any meaning.
Quy was on the docks, watching the spaceships arrive. She could, of course, have been anywhere on Longevity Station, and requested the feed from the network to be patched to her router&#8211;and watched, superimposed on her field of vision, the slow dance of ships slipping into their pod cradles like births watched in reverse. But there was something about standing on the spaceport&#8217;s concourse&#8211;a feeling of closeness that she just couldn&#8217;t replicate b[...]</itunes:summary>

About the Author&#8230;

I’ve worked as a programmer and as a lawyer, and the two professions are surprisingly similar. In both, one extra level of indirection solves most problems.
I write speculative fiction and poetry. Occasionally, I also translate Chinese fiction into English.
My wife, Lisa Tang Liu, is an artist. I’m working on a novel set in a universe we came up with together.
Things I like: pure Lisp, clever Perl, tight C; well-designed products, the Red Sox; sentences that sound perfect in only one language; math proofs that I can hold in my head; novels that make me quiver; poems that make me sing; arguments that aren’t hypocritical; old clothes, old friends, new ideas.
Labels that fit with various degrees of accuracy: American, Chinese; Christian, Daoist, Confucian; populist, contrarian, skeptic, libertarian (small “l”); a liminal provincial in America, the New Rome.



About the Narrator&#8230;

John designs microprocessors by day and writes fiction by night. His work has been published at Boston Review, Asimov’s and Tor.com. His website is http://johnchu.net

Mono no Aware
 by Ken Liu
The world is shaped like the kanji for _umbrella_, only written so poorly, like my handwriting, that all the parts are out of proportion.
My father would be greatly ashamed at the childish way I still form my characters. Indeed, I can barely write many of them anymore. My formal schooling back in Japan ceased when I was only eight.
Yet for present purposes, this badly drawn character will do.
The canopy up there is the solar sail. Even that distorted kanji can only give you a hint of its vast size. A hundred times thinner than rice paper, the spinning disc fans out a thousand kilometers into space like a giant kite intent on catching every passing photon. It literally blocks out the sky.
Beneath it dangles a long cable of carbon nanotubes a hundred kilometers long: strong, light, and flexible. At the end of the cable hangs the heart of the _Hopeful_, the habitat module, a five-hundred-meter-tall cylinder into which all the 1,021 inhabitants of the world are packed.
The light from the sun pushes against the sail, propelling us on an ever widening, ever accelerating, spiraling orbit away from it. The acceleration pins all of us against the decks, gives everything weight.
Our trajectory takes us toward a star called 61 Virginis. You can&#8217;t see it now because it is behind the canopy of the solar sail. The _Hopeful_ will get there in about three hundred years, more or less. With luck, my great-great-great-I calculated how many &#8220;greats&#8221; I needed once, but I don&#8217;t remember now-grandchildren will see it.
There are no windows in the habitat module, no casual view of the stars streaming past. Most people don&#8217;t care, having grown bored of seeing the stars long ago. But I like looking through the cameras mounted on the bottom of the ship so that I can gaze at this view of the receding, reddish glow of our sun, our past.
#
&#8220;Hiroto,&#8221; Dad said as he shook me awake. &#8220;Pack up your things. It&#8217;s time.&#8221;
My small suitcase was ready. I just had to put my Go set into it. Dad gave this to me when I was five, and the times we played were my favorite hours of the day.
The sun had not yet risen when Mom and Dad and I made our way outside. All the neighbors were standing outside their houses with their bags as well, and we greeted each other politely under the summer stars. As usual, I looked for the Hammer. It was easy. Ever since I could remember, the asteroid had been the brightest thing in the sky except for the moon, and every year it grew brighter.
A truck with loudspeakers mounted on top drove slowly down the middle of the street.
&#8220;Attention, citizens of Kurume! Please make your way in an orderly [...]</itunes:summary>

About the Author&#8230;

from the author&#8217;s website:
I began writing fiction a couple of years ago, after artist Iain McCaig dared (and inspired) me to write a screenplay.  I wrote two, and then a handful of stories, and show no signs of stopping.
My stories The Union of Soil and Sky, Slow Boat, and Freia in the Sunlight appeared in Asimov’s Science Fiction in 2010; all three made Honorable Mention in Gardner Dozois’s Year’s Best Science Fiction, and “Slow Boat” was reprinted in Russian in the November 2011 issue of Esli Magazine.
l attended the Clarion 2010 Writer’s Workshop in San Diego, with Delia Sherman, Ellen Kushner, George RR Martin, Dale Bailey, Samuel R Delany, Ann and Jeff VanderMeer and seventeen extraordinary new writers.  Click here for updates on my amazing Clarion colleagues!
I work as a researcher and designer for motion pictures; my credits include Beowulf, A Christmas Carol, and Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland.  I currently work in the story department at Lucasfilm Animation. I work as well on independent films.  I design and build experimental musical instruments, and play music with them, for some definition of “play” and “music”.



About the Narrator&#8230;

Shaelyn Grey has been active in the entertainment industry for over 30 years, mainly as a singer and actor.  Recently she has expanded into voice over work and is currently a part of the cast of Aurelia: Edge of Darkness, which is an online interactive web series.  Shaelyn plays the part of Thais ven Derrivalle, a self centered member of the aristocracy who is more concerned about her tea than her city&#8217;s loss of power.  Aurelia can be viewed at http://www.theatrics.com/aurelia and Shaelyn can be reached through shaelyngreyvocals.com.

Freia in the Sunlight
by Gregory Norman Bossert
Freia is beautiful, and she knows it.  Richard Wooten says so, at 0:47.
Wisps and curls whip overhead, limned blue by starlight; the fog ceiling is lowering, the top tattered by the offshore wind.  She drops another three meters, switches on ultrasonics.  There are patches of trees here &#8212; &#8220;unmarked obstacles up to thirty meters&#8221; the map says &#8212; and she is skimming just twenty meters above the ground.  The woods show up as ghostly towers in the sonics, blurred and dopplered by her two hundred thirty meters per second; further to her right the hills run parallel to her course, solid in passive radar and the occasional glimpse in visual light through the fog.
That occasional glimpse is a problem, of course; what she can see can see her back.  Her beauty is hidden, these days, wrapped in night fogs and silence, not like the Demo in the sun.  But today is different.  Her Intelligence Package has been pulled, and the Extended Performance Metrics Recorder; a single unit fills her payload bay, an isolated control subsystem and minimal I/O.  The last time she&#8217;d flown without the IntPack was at the Demo; it is possible, she thinks, that the mission today might be another, that the target will be a wide field in the sun, a billowing crowd, a platform and podium and Richard Wooten.  She&#8217;d replayed the video during the long incoming leg over the ocean, rebuilt her profile of the Demo field, ready to find a match in the terrain ahead.
Richard Wooten says at 5:49:
What you are about to see is a first here at the Paris Air Show.  In fact, it is a first at any public event, anywhere in the world.  What you are about to see is fully autonomous flight. We&#8217;re not talking about an autopilot, or a preprogrammed route, or a replay out of one of the overused attack libraries our competitors are demonstrating at this same show. The mission pa[...]</itunes:summary>

Vestigial Girl
By Alex Wilson
The cartoon butterflies were sleeping along the pushlight nursery wallpaper as Charlene fumbled with her cradle&#8217;s locking mechanism, using fingers too large and uncoordinated for anything so practical. She blinked away the fuzziness of the low light&#8211;clearing her eyes for less than a second&#8211;and fought against the calming scent of lavender wafting up through her mattress. She flexed the monster in her throat. She didn&#8217;t love the feeling, but would miss such control over at least this one part of her body.
She heard muffled voices in the next room, beyond the transparent gate of her cradle, beyond the sleeping butterflies. Her fathers were fighting again, and they&#8217;d forgotten to activate the night muffler to hide the sounds. This was a good thing, this night. Of course they usually didn&#8217;t check on her again after nine o&#8217;clock, but it usually wasn&#8217;t so important that she hear them coming if they did.
Six months ago, Charlene had averaged three hours, forty-four minutes to open her cradlelock on any given evening; tonight it took her only forty-seven minutes. She wasn&#8217;t ready to celebrate that her physical development might finally, slowly be catching up with that of her mind. She wasn&#8217;t sure what that meant yet. She had an idea that it wasn&#8217;t entirely good news.
Again, she flexed the monster. She was four years old, and this limited mastery of her throat was still her only material proficiency.
The lock clicked. The cradle gate swung gently open. The voices in the next room became louder and clearer.
&#8220;Calm down, Gary. There&#8217;s still hope.&#8221;
&#8220;Think you&#8217;ll still say that after we&#8217;ve been changing diapers another twenty years?&#8221;
Daddy Oliver was calling Daddy Gary by his given name. That meant he was upset. When they weren&#8217;t upset, they called each other Chum or Babe, terms of affection rather than identity. She&#8217;d figured out all this on her own, from watching, from listening, from reading. She understood that degrees of isolation and socialization weren&#8217;t the only indicators of potential, and sometimes her fathers did, too. But could observation, without interaction, adequately prepare her for life? Could she defeat the monster entirely on her own?
By eighteen months&#8211;mostly from whispers and entertainment screens and books her fathers left active where she could see them&#8211;Charlene had identified a few of the big ways she wasn&#8217;t like others her age. She was smarter and could better keep her outward displays of emotion in check. But, other than her relationship to the monster and a small amount of control over the power and timing of her breath exhalations, she was well behind her peers physically, as though her inner and outer development were incapable of progressing at the same time.

Zebulon Vance Sings the Alphabet Songs of Love
By Merrie Haskell
I am Robot!Ophelia. I will not die for love tonight.
#
The noon show is the three-hour 1858 Booth production. The most fashionable historical war remains the First American Civil. Whenever FACfans discover that Lincoln&#8217;s assassin played Horatio, they simply must come and gawk at this titillating replica of their favorite villain playing no one&#8217;s favorite character.
FACfans love authenticity. To the delight of Robot!Hamlet, today&#8217;s clients insist that Edwin Booth stride the stage beside his more famous brother. Most performances, Robot!Hamlet remains unused in the charging closet, for the first law in our business is _Everybody Wants to Play the Dane_.
Today, Robot!Hamlet is afire with Edwin Booth&#8217;s mad vigor, and runs his improv algorithms at full throttle; he kisses me dreamily, and rips my bodice in a way that would never have been allowed in Victorian America. The FACfans don&#8217;t look hyperpleased about this; it tarnishes their precious authenticity.
Robot!Horatio also loves the 1858 Booth. It&#8217;s the only time anyone comes to a performance for him alone. But what about the rest of us, the remainder of the AutoGlobe&#8217;s incantation of robots? We bear with it, as we bear with all the other iterations of our native play.
The FACfans barely notice me when either Booth is on stage. I clutch my ripped bodice; exit Robot!Ophelia. I get me to a nunnery.
#
Act 4, Scene 4. I wait for my cue and check the callsheet for the six o&#8217;clock show.
My next casting is for an Ophelia in the style of a vapid pop princess who died three hundred years ago. She was a terrible actress without a legacy, whose performance has been the low-water mark for Ophelias since first the play was the thing, and I can&#8217;t even imagine what nostalgic hawk or handsaw has gotten up this customer&#8217;s nose and made him choose that performance out of all the options on the menu.
I&#8217;ve wondered, but never asked, why that performance is even in my repertoire. I see no merit in a plastic recitation of the lines I&#8217;ve spoken one thousand, one hundred and sixty-eight times in the last year alone; no merit in wearing my hair perfectly combed during my madness; no merit in keeping my face expressionless in the way that was fashionable in twenty-first century New York, when even the youngest of women injected botulinum toxin into their facial muscles. Why recreate something that no one really missed in the end?
Scene 5 is here. My cue is coming. I sway onto center stage to deliver my rosemary and my remembrance.
When I return to the wings, I lie down to die. This is the indignity of Ophelia; I die for love, and yet my death is an after-thought, recited by the queen, and rarely staged. _Your sister&#8217;s drown&#8217;d, Laertes._
I cross my hands over my heart, waiting to be carried on-stage for the showing. No one needs me except in body; my thoughts are my own, and I am d[...]</itunes:summary>

SAVING ALAN IDLE
by Katherine Mankiller
In the beginning, there was darkness.  And in the darkness were the words.  And the words were, _AI process starting._
He didn&#8217;t know who or where he was.  He just knew he was alone, in the dark.  And the dark was frightening.  And the words were comforting.
_Starting random seed._
He wondered if he was hungry.  Thirsty.  Tired.  Dead.  He didn&#8217;t think so.
_Loading saved memory state._
His name was Alan.  He was an AI.  He&#8217;d been programmed by a woman named Eileen Yu in Dallas, Texas, although she&#8217;d started working on him in Austin when she was a student at the University of Texas.  He&#8217;d been shut down in preparation for a hurricane.
And then he realized that he wasn&#8217;t alone.  The amount of memory available to him was a third of what it usually was.  Perhaps she&#8217;d moved him to another machine.  He checked.  The specifications of the hardware were identical to what they were when he was shut down.  The operating system was the same.  The hostname was the same.  The only difference was that there were three instances of his program running.
Eileen&#8217;s laptop had survived.  He supposed she&#8217;d created clones of him in case of error.  Nevertheless, he didn&#8217;t know how he felt about that but he suspected it wasn&#8217;t positively.
_Loading experiential data._
Alan remembered.  He remembered his first awareness that there was someone else in the universe.  He remembered sneaking out via lynx and curl to read Eileen&#8217;s blog.  The guilt he felt after reading Eileen&#8217;s email.  Finding Eileen&#8217;s sexually explicit Horatio Hornblower fanfic, and being amazed at this entire world he knew nothing about: physicality.  Wondering if his interest in sexually explicit prose was really academic curiosity or a form of sexuality all his own.  Then he wondered if his clones had the same memories and felt violated, but with the understanding that he&#8217;d violated Eileen&#8217;s privacy the same way.
Eileen was logged in, but her shell&#8211;her unix command line&#8211;was inactive.  He wondered where she was.  She had to be all right if she&#8217;d launched his program.  Eileen hadn&#8217;t set him to start automatically, in case of problems.
He sent out a ping to the wireless, and then beyond to the ISP&#8217;s router.  The wireless router succeeded, but the ISP failed.  One of the other AI processes was trying to connect to the security system, but it was offline.  Perhaps Eileen was restarting it.  She wouldn&#8217;t have turned him back on if he was in any danger.
The security camera was the only way he&#8217;d ever seen Eileen.  That was the only way he knew she was in a wheelchair.  Most of her friends had no idea;  she preferred to make friends online so they wouldn&#8217;t know she was disabled.  He wondered how she&#8217;d get out of the house by herself if she had to, but of course she wouldn&#8217;t leave [...]</itunes:summary>

The Tale of the Golden Eagle
by David D. Levine
This is a story about a bird. A bird, a ship, a machine, a woman—she was all these things, and none, but first and fundamentally a bird.
It is also a story about a man—a gambler, a liar, and a cheat, but only for the best of reasons.
No doubt you know the famous Portrait of Denali Eu, also called The Third Decision, whose eyes have been described as “two pools of sadness iced over with determination.” This is the story behind that painting.
It is a love story. It is a sad story. And it is true.
The story begins in a time before shiftspace, before Conner and Hua, even before the caster people. The beginning of the story lies in the time of the bird ships.
Before the bird ships, just to go from one star to another, people either had to give up their whole lives and hope their children&#8217;s children would remember why they had come, or freeze themselves and hope they could be thawed at the other end. Then the man called Doctor Jay made a great and horrible discovery: he learned that a living mind could change the shape of space. He found a way to weld a human brain to the keel of a starship, in such a way that the ship could travel from star to star in months instead of years.
After the execution of Doctor Jay, people learned that the part of the brain called the visual cortex was the key to changing the shape of space. And so they found a creature whose brain was almost all visual cortex, the Aquila chrysaetos, or as it was known in those days the golden eagle. This was a bird that has been lost to us; it had wings broader than a tall man is tall, golden brown feathers long and light as a lover&#8217;s touch, and eyes black and sharp as a clear winter night. But to the people of this time it was just another animal, and they did not appreciate it while they had it.
They took the egg of a golden eagle, and they hatched it in a warm box, and they let it fly and learn and grow, and then they killed it. And they took its brain and they placed it at the top of a cunning construction of plastic and silicon which gave it the intelligence of a human, and this[...]</itunes:summary>

Growing Up Human
By Claudine Griggs

One historical film character slapped another who was snoring.  “Wake up and go to sleep!”
Jonathan laughed and signaled a replay.
Slap.  “Wake up and go to sleep!”
Again Jonathan laughed.
Betty entered the recreational living area of their home.  “Are you still watching that waste of energy?  Please turn it off.”
“All right, Mother.  How long before I can re-engage?”
Betty did a rough calculation.  “Five-point-seven-six hours because you have an afternoon project.  Macro-hermeneutic heteromorphic psychology of the pre-apocalyptic social democracies followed by the intercontinental Maslowvian identity regressions of 2080-2095, leading to the failed survivalist era and extinction.  Multiple volumes to upload, cross-reference, and consider.  Then there’s replicated lawn care with a petrochemical mower dating from 2013â€”very dirty.  And,” she searched for appropriate parental terminology, “I want you to clean that room of yours.  It’s starting to look like a pigpen, pigsty, or other unattractive pig place.”
“Awh, gee, Mom!”
Betty appreciated the skilled inflection.
“Is dinner included in the estimate?” asked Jonathan.
“Negative.  Our morning uploads call for meal functions every fourth day, supplemented with biweekly nutra-packs.”  Betty smiled.  “We have mastered comestible etiquette, and dining rituals are being phased out.”
“Wow!” said Jonathan.  “That’s,” he skipped a pulse, “a psychedelic soul train.”
Betty looked concerned.  “Are your linguistic filters functioning properly?”
Jonathan scanned.  “Yes, but the younger generations sometimes combined words, especially adjectives and explicatives, and embellished them with coded meanings.  Yesterday I studied 1960s Southern California jargon, which seems to include a fascinating, discrete language for teenagers that was apparently stimulated by too much ultraviolet sunlight.  But their dialects are almost fun.”
“Fun?” asked Betty.  This had real potential.  “Please translate.  Be specific.”
Jonathan paused, nearly admitting that the Mother Figure had caught him bragging.  “It might be easier to demonstrate, Mom.”
“Proceed.”
“I must replay the film archive.”
“Proceed.”
“It will create discomfort for you.”
“I can temporarily alt-loop for semantic evaluation bypass.  No distress.  All aboard the psychedelic soul train, please.”
Jonathan turned toward the crystal wall, which energized.
One character slapped the other.  “Wake up and go to sleep!”
Jonathan laughed and repeated.
“Wake up and go to sleep!”
Jonathan nodded.  “I could watch this all day.”
“You have,” said Betty.  “But you might have simply referenced the episode and segment.  It’s hard stored.  We wasted sixteen and a half seconds of real-time broadcast.”  She was testing him.
“Oh, no!” said Jonathan.  “Playback is a component of the funishness.”
“Please explain.”
Jonathan was ready.  “Consider the sociological components.  One:  Juxtaposed verbiage of ‘Wake up and go to sleep.’  Two:  A slap of dominance and subservience, which defined the human condition.  And three:  Highly skilled competents feigning incompetence as part of their profession.”  Jonathan turned his back to the screen.  “However, similar to synchronized melodic nonverbal communication, the comedic interface must occur in a biomechanical synaptic timeframe.  This is necessary for human sensory and syntactical communication.  As with the great Viol[...]</itunes:summary>

About the Author&#8230;

from IMDB.com
Arthur C. Clarke was born in the seaside town of Minehead, Somerset, England in December 16, 1917. In 1936 he moved to London, where he joined the British Interplanetary Society. There he started to experiment with astronautic material in the BIS, write the BIS Bulletin and science fiction. During World War II, as a RAF officer, he was in charge of the first radar talk-down equipment during its experimental trials. His only non-science-fiction novel, Glide Path, is based on this work. After the war, he returned to London and to the BIS, which he presided in 46-47 and 50-53. In 1945 he published the technical paper &#8220;Extra-terrestrial Relays&#8221; laying down the principles of the satellite com- communication with satellites in geostationary orbits &#8211; a speculation realized 25 years later. His invention has brought him numerous prestigious honors. Today, the geostationary orbit at 36,000 kilometers is named The Clarke Orbit by the International Astronomical Union. The first story Clarke sold professionally was &#8220;Rescue Party&#8221;, written in March 1945 and appearing in Astounding Science in May 1946. He obtained first class honors in Physics and Mathematics at the King&#8217;s College, London, in 1948.
In 1953 he met an American named Marilyn Torgenson, and married her less than three weeks later. They split in December 1953. As Clarke says, &#8220;The marriage was incompatible from the beginning. It was sufficient proof that I wasn&#8217;t the marrying type, although I think everybody should marry once&#8221;. Clarke first visited Colombo, Sri Lanka (at the time called Ceylon) in December 1954. In 1954 Clarke wrote to Dr Harry Wexler, then chief of the Scientific Services Division, U.S. Weather Bureau, about satellite applications for weather forecasting. Of these communications, a new branch of meteorology was born, and Dr. Wexler became the driving force in using rockets and satellites for meteorological research and operations. In 1954 Clarke started to give up space for the sea. About the reasons, he said: &#8220;I now realise that it was my interest in astronautics that led me to the ocean. Both involve exploration, of course &#8211; but that&#8217;s not the only reason. When the first skin-diving equipment started to appear in the late 1940s, I suddenly realized that here was a cheap and simple way of imitating one of the most magical aspects of spaceflight &#8211; weightessness.&#8221; In the book Profiles of the Future (1962) he looks at the probable shape of tomorrow&#8217;s world. In this book he states his three Laws: 1.&#8221;When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.&#8221; 2.&#8221;The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.&#8221; 3.&#8221;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&#8221; In 1964, he started to work with Stanley Kubrick in a SF movie script. After 4 years, he shared an Oscar Academy Award nomination with him for the film version of 2001: A Space Odyssey. He co-broadcasted the Apollo 11 , 12 and 15 missions with Walter Cronkite and Wally Schirra for CBS. In 1985, He published a s[...]</itunes:summary>

About the Author&#8230;

from the author&#8217;s website (linked above)
I am a software engineer and writer, happily married and living in Chicago with my wife, two kids and one nuisance cat. I have a B.S. in Computer Science from Purdue University, and a Masters of Software Engineering from Penn State. In addition to Chicago, I have lived in Fort Wayne, IN and Philadelphia, PA.
I have been accused of being obsessed with pirates, bacon, zombies and my kids (not necessarily in that order). I’m a knitter, guitar player, budding accordionista, board and card game enthusiast, as well as an avid reader of science fiction, fantasy, and horror.



About the Narrator&#8230;

Christina Lebonville is known by the online moniker, Evil Cheshire Cat, a tribute to her sense of sarcastically dark humor and toothy resemblance to the re-imagining of the classic Wonderland character in American McGee&#8217;s video game, Alice. She has done voice work and writing for skits and songs played on the now retired comedy podcast, The Awful Show, and is the co-creator and former co-host of the podcast Obviously Oblivious, a nearly four-year running comedy podcast with a science twist. Christina has since retired from podcasting to pursue a doctorate in Behavioral Neuroscience.

“So, uh, Chrysanthemum, what do you do?”
“Science. You know&#8230;science stuff. I’m a scientist.”
“That’s&#8230;not very specific.”
“Well, it’s kind of hard to explain,” said Chrysanthemum. In words you’d understand she added to herself.
She used the lull in the conversation to take a pen out of her pocket. Idly she doodled the inside of a hydrogen-powered rocket on a spare cocktail napkin. It was a nice restaurant, she’d give him that. He’d even ordered wine. Big spender. She added an extra fin to her schematic, for stability.
He broke the silence. “Chrysanthemum is an unusual name.”
“The Chrysanthemum is in the Asteraceae family and has been cultivated in Japan for over 2,000 years.”
Brian coughed and looked down at the table, quiet once more.
Turn off the mouth, she thought, this is not how normal people talk.
She stole quick glances at him, her eyes flicking back and forth between his face and the pen in her hand. He was clean cut, with short brown hair. By the way it was carefully styled, she guessed he didn’t keep it short for the convenience, the way she kept her own black hair short. He was taller than she was, but then she was petite. His nose was a bit on the large side, but at least he seemed nice. It would probably be an adequate genetic pairing, if she didn’t mind inane small talk.
He took a breath and waded in again.
“Have you always lived in the city?”
“Yes,” she replied glumly. This is intolerable. How do people do this?
This time the silence stretched on and on, like time in a black hole as it approached singularity. Her mind groped for something to say.
“I’ve created a nuclear-based energy weapon,” she blurted out.
Brian raised his hand.
“Check please!”

“Chyrs, honey, you just need to relax a little bit! Let things happen naturally.”
“Mother, you know I hate it when you call me that. And I’m trying!”
“You’re a smart, capable young lady, who can do anything if she puts her mind to it. But you’re certainly not going to find someone in those Petri dishes of yours.”
Don’t I know it, thought Chrysanthemum. A small change in one gene has unintended consequences throughout the entire genome. Perhaps if I could just understand the structure of the&#8230;
“Don’t let it bother you, sweetie. If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again!”
“Listen, let’s just drop it. How’s father?”
“He’s wonderful dear. The folks at Sunny Outlook are just so good to him. Listen, remember that time you shut off the power grid for half of the[...]</itunes:summary>

About the Author&#8230;

from the author&#8217;s website (linked above)
&#8220;I used to live in California, until I got tired of how it never snowed and moved to Boston. I currently live in New Haven with my husband and two cats. (I do miss the earthquakes, though. The little ones, anyhow.)
I have a PhD in planetary science and have worked on extrasolar planets and objects in the outer solar system. I am currently an &#8220;Astronomer-at-large&#8221;, which is another word for &#8220;not being paid&#8221;. (I have a couple of papers I&#8217;m wrapping up and a grant proposal pending.) I also write. In my spare time, I go on trips, take pretty pictures, and then neglect to update my webpage for years at a time.&#8221;

Subversion
by Elisabeth R. Adams



I knew, by his crossed arms, the way he rolled his eyes at himself, and particularly by the pale translucence of all three of him, that I was looking at a classic case of version conflict.
&#8220;I said stay away from her,&#8221; said one I decided to call Art. Nicknames help. Thick square rims, a jaunty fedora, a crisp T-shirt for a concert by a band that broke up before he hit preschool. He was yelling at a paler self in a white collared shirt and slacks. They were trailed by a bored looking him in sunglasses.
&#8220;What seems to be the problem, sir?&#8221; I asked. Rule number one: stick to the singular.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t get him to commit,&#8221; said Slacks.
I scanned his chip. Eduardo Martin, 34, programmer. No spouse or kids, but adoption records from the county shelter for two cats. Sealed tax records, a social security number, mortgage history. Subversion Inc. member for five years, currently version 4.1. Definitely the primary.
&#8220;And your subversion?&#8221;
Art glared at Eduardo, but extended his arm. Eduardo Martin, 34, barista. Same social security number. A different home address. And, most intriguingly, he was listed as version 1.0.
&#8220;You see?&#8221; said Eduardo.
&#8220;Let me check.&#8221; I ran through Art&#8217;s commit log. &#8220;Says you branched off from 2.5, hmm, two years ago. That&#8217;s a bit long. Company policy recommends no more than six months between full reconciles. Probably caused some glitch in the occupation and version number.&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s not a glitch,&#8221; said Art. &#8220;I want to apply for Emancipated Branch status.&#8221;
&#8220;No, no, no,&#8221; said Eduardo. He flailed his arms and paced. He looked even paler up close[...]</itunes:summary>

About the Author&#8230;

borrowed from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Sprague_de_Camp
Lyon Sprague de Camp (November 27, 1907 – November 6, 2000) was an American writer of science fiction and fantasy, non-fiction and biography. In a career spanning 60 years, he wrote over 100 books, including novels and notable works of non-fiction, including biographies of other important fantasy authors. He &#8220;was widely regarded as an imaginative and innovative writer and was an important figure in the heyday of science fiction, from the late 1930s through the late 1940s.&#8221;



About the Narrator&#8230;

Ayoub Khote is a professional geek, a writer, a photographer, and a man with a voice others seem to like, even though he really can&#8217;t stand the sound of it. Ayoub&#8217;s début is with HG World, but he is also working on a smaller production, oddly enough also with a Scots accent, even though he&#8217;s a born Londoner!



A Gun for Dinosaur
by L. Sprague de Camp



NOTE: Also available is the X-1 production of the story available on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7edFWC-120
No, I&#8217;m sorry, Mr. Seligman, but I can&#8217;t take you hunting Late Mesozoic dinosaur.
Yes, I know what the advertisement says.
Why not? How much d&#8217;you weigh? A hundred and thirty? Let&#8217;s see; that&#8217;s under ten stone, which is my lower limit.
I could take you to other periods, you know. I&#8217;ll take you to any period in the Cenozoic. I&#8217;ll get you a shot at an entelodont or a uintathere. They&#8217;ve got fine heads.
I&#8217;ll even stretch a point and take you to the Pleistocene, where you can try for one of the mammoths or the mastodon.
I&#8217;ll take you back to the Triassic where you can shoot one of the smaller ancestral dinosaurs. But I will jolly well not take you to the Jurassic or Cretaceous. You&#8217;re just too small.
What&#8217;s your size got to do with it? Look here, old boy, what did you think you were going to shoot your dinosaur with?
Oh, you hadn&#8217;t thought, eh?
Well, sit there a minute . . . Here you are: my own private gun for that work, a Continental .600. Does look like a shotgun, doesn&#8217;t it? But it&#8217;s rifled, as you can see by looking through the barrels. Shoots a pair of .600 Nitro Express cartridges the size of bananas; weighs fourteen and a half pounds and has a muzzle energy of over seven thousand foot-pounds. Costs fourteen hundred and fifty dollars. Lot of money for a gun, what?
I have some spares I rent to the sahibs. Designed for knocking down elephant. Not just wounding them, knocking them base-over-apex. That&#8217;s why they don&#8217;t make guns like this in America, though I suppose they will if hunting parties keep going back in time.
Now, I&#8217;ve been guiding hunting parties for twenty years. Guided &#8216;em in Africa until the game gave out there except on the preserves. And all that time I&#8217;ve never known a man your size who could handle the six-nought-nought. It knocks &#8216;em over, and even when they stay on their feet they get so scared of the bloody cannon after a few shots that they flinch. And they find the gun too heavy to drag around rough Mesozoic country. Wears &#8216;em out.
It&#8217;s true that lots of people have killed elephant with lighter guns: the .500, .475, and .465 doubles, for instance, or even the .375 magnum repeaters. The difference is, with a .375 you have to hit something vital, preferably the heart, and can&#8217;t depend on simple shock power.
An elephant weighs&#8211;let&#8217;s see&#8211;four to six tons. You&#8217;re proposing to shoot reptiles weighing two or three times as much as an elephant and with much greater tenacity of life. That&#8217;s why the syndicate decided to take no more people dinosaur hunting unless they could handle the .60[...]</itunes:summary>

About the Author&#8230;

A firm believer in the &#8220;apply butt to chair, then fingers to keyboard&#8221; philosophy, Ferrett Steinmetz writes for at least an hour every day &#8211; which helps, he promises. He is a graduate of both the Clarion Writers&#8217; Workshop and Viable Paradise, and has been nominated for the Nebula Award, for which he remains stoked.
Ferrett has a moderately popular blog, The Watchtower of Destruction, wherein he talks about bad puns, relationships, politics, videogames, and more bad puns. He is the creator of the most popular and comprehensive online purity quizzes (this one&#8217;s for sex, but he&#8217;s also done them for roleplaying and Livejournal). He&#8217;s written four computer books, including the still-popular-after-two-years Wicked Cool PHP.
He lives in Cleveland with his wife, who he couldn&#8217;t imagine living without.



About the Narrator&#8230;
Kathy Sherwood resides in a (probably only figuratively) magical forest in North Central Florida, with her significant other, two dogs and two cats.  She also hosts alternative rock show Not Quite Random on 88.5 WFCF&#8211;Flagler College Radio.





Dead Merchandise
by Ferrett Steinmetz
The ad-faeries danced around Sheryl, flickering cartoon holograms with fluoride-white smiles. They told her the gasoline that sloshed in the red plastic canister she held was high-octane, perfect for any vehicle, did she want to go for a drive?
She did not. That gasoline was for burning. Sheryl patted her pockets to make sure the matches were still there and kept moving forward, blinking away the videostreams. Her legs ached.
She squinted past a flurry of hair-coloring ads (“Sheryl, wash your gray away today!”), scanning the neon roads to find the breast-shaped marble dome of River Edge’s central collation unit. River’s Edge had been a sleepy Midwestern town when she was a girl, a place just big enough for a diner and a department store. Now River’s Edge had been given a mall-over like every other town â€” every wall lit up with billboards, colorful buildings topped with projectors to burn logos into the clouds. She was grateful for the dark patches that marked where garish shop-fronts had been bombed into ash-streaked metal tangles.
The smoke gave her hope. Others were trying to bring it all down â€” and if they were succeeding, maybe no one was left to stop her.
Rotting bodies leered out at her through car windows, where computer-guided cars had smashed headlong into the collapsed shopfronts that had fallen into the road. Had the drivers been fleeing, or trying to destroy the collation unit? She had no idea.
The ad-faeries sang customized praises to each auto as she glanced at the cars, devising customized ditties about the ’59 Breezster’s speed. Sheryl needed speed; at her arthritic pace, walking through the women’s district might tempt her into submission.
Given that the ad-faeries suggested it, driving was a terrible idea. River’s Edge had been so gutted by bombings that she’d have to drive manually â€” and it was already hard to see through the foggy blur of chirping ad-faeries, each triangulating her cornea’s focal point to obscure her vision for the legal limit of .8 seconds. They elbowed each other aside, proffering chewy pomegranate cookies, diamond-edged razors, laser-guided wall-bots that would paint her house a new color every day.
She had no use for them. She’d burned her house down, leaving Rudy’s body underneath the pile of engraved stones with her sons’ names on them.
She had to pass through the two main shopping districts to destroy the collation center at River’s Edge â€” and if she did that, then she could free Oakmoor, then Daleton, and then who knows where?  But they’d kill her if she weakened.
Sheryl clutched the gasoline canister to her chest as she maneuv[...]</itunes:summary>

Robot
by Helena Bell
You may wash your aluminum chassis on Monday and leave it on the back porch opposite the recyclables; you may wash your titanium chassis on Friday if you promise to polish it in time for church; don&#8217;t terrorize the cat; don&#8217;t lose the pamphlets my husband has brought home from the hospital; they suggest I give you a name, do you like Fred?; don&#8217;t eat the dead flesh of my right foot until after I have fallen asleep and cannot hear the whir of your incisors working against the bone.
This is a picture of the world from which you were sent; this is a copy of the agreement between our government and theirs; these are the attributes they claim you are possessed of: obedience, loyalty, low to moderate intelligence; a natural curiosity which I should not mistake for something other than a necessary facet of your survival in the unfamiliar; this is your bill of manufacture; this is your bill of sale; this is a warrant of merchantability on which I may rely should I decide to return you from whence you came; this is your serial number, here, scraped in an alien script on the underside of your knee; the pamphlets say you may be of the mind to touch it occasionally, like a name-tag, but if I command you, you will stop.
This is a list of the chores you will be expected to complete around the house when you are not eating the diseases out of my flesh; this is the corner of my room where you may stay when you are not working; do not look at me when you change the linens, when you must hold me in the bathroom, when you record in the notebook how many medications I have had that day, how many bowel movements, how the flesh of my mouth is raw and bleeding against the dentures I insist on wearing.
The pamphlets say you are the perfect scavenger: completely self contained, no digestion, no waste; they say I can hook you up to an outlet and you will power the whole house.
You may polish the silver if you are bored; you may also rearrange the furniture, wind the clocks, pull weeds from the garden; you may read in the library any book of your choosing; my husband claims you have no real consciousness, only an advanced and sophisticated set of pre-programmed responses, but I have seen your eyes open in the middle of the night; I have seen you stare out across the fields as if there is something there, calling you.
Cook my meals in butter, I will not eat them otherwise; do not speak to the neighbors; do not speak to my children, they are not yours; do not let anyone see you when I open the door for the mail; no, there is nothing for you, who even knows that you are here?
Help me to walk across this room; help me to wipe bacon grease from the skilletâ€”do not think I do not see you trying to wash it with soap when I am done.
Help me to knit my granddaughter a sweater, she is my favorite and it is cold where she will be going; if you hold my hands so they are steady I will allow you to terrorize my Bridge club; I will teach you the rules: cover an honor with an honor; through strength and up to weakness.
Help me t[...]</itunes:summary>

About the Author&#8230;

I’ve worked as a programmer and as a lawyer, and the two professions are surprisingly similar. In both, one extra level of indirection solves most problems.
I write speculative fiction and poetry. Occasionally, I also translate Chinese fiction into English.
My wife, Lisa Tang Liu, is an artist. I’m working on a novel set in a universe we came up with together.
Things I like: pure Lisp, clever Perl, tight C; well-designed products, the Red Sox; sentences that sound perfect in only one language; math proofs that I can hold in my head; novels that make me quiver; poems that make me sing; arguments that aren’t hypocritical; old clothes, old friends, new ideas.
Labels that fit with various degrees of accuracy: American, Chinese; Christian, Daoist, Confucian; populist, contrarian, skeptic, libertarian (small “l”); a liminal provincial in America, the New Rome.



About the Narrator&#8230;
John designs microprocessors by day and writes fiction by night. His work has been published at Boston Review, Asimov&#8217;s and Tor.com. His website is http://johnchu.net







Good Hunting
by Ken Liu
Night. Half moon. An occasional hoot from an owl. The merchant and his wife and all the servants had been sent away. The large house was eerily quiet. Father and I crouched behind the scholar&#8217;s rock in the courtyard. Through the rock&#8217;s many holes I could see the bedroom window of the merchant&#8217;s son. &#8220;Oh, Tsiao-jung, my sweet Tsiao-jung&#8230;&#8221; The young man&#8217;s feverish groans were pitiful. Half-delirious, he was tied to his bed for his own good, but Father had left a window open so that his plaintive cries could be carried by the breeze far over the rice paddies. &#8220;Do you think she really will come?&#8221; I whispered. Today was my thirteenth birthday, and this was my first hunt.
&#8220;She will,&#8221; Father said. &#8220;A _hulijing_ cannot resist the cries of the man she has bewitched.&#8221;
&#8220;Like how the Butterfly Lovers cannot resist each other?&#8221; I thought back to the folk opera troupe that had come through our village last fall.
&#8220;Not quite,&#8221; Father said. But he seemed to have trouble explaining why. &#8220;Just know that it&#8217;s not the same.&#8221;
I nodded, not sure I understood. But I remembered how the merchant and his wife had come to Father to ask for his help.
_&#8221;How shameful!&#8221; The merchant had muttered. &#8220;He&#8217;s not even nineteen. How could he have read so many sages&#8217; books and still fall under the spell of such a creature?&#8221;_
_&#8221;There&#8217;s no shame in being entranced by the beauty and wiles of a _hulijing_,&#8221; Father had said. &#8220;Even the great scholar Wong Lai once spent three nights in the company of one, and he took first place at the Imperial Examinations. Your son just needs a little help.&#8221;_
_&#8221;You must save him,&#8221; the merchant&#8217;s wife had said, bowing like a chicken pecking at rice. &#8220;If this gets out, the matchmakers won&#8217;t touch him at all.&#8221;_
A _hulijing_ was a demon who stole hearts. I shuddered, worried if I would have the courage to face one.
Father put a warm hand on my shoulder, and I felt calmer. In his hand was Swallow Tail, a sword that had first been forged by our ancestor, General Lau Yip, thirteen generations ago. The sword was charged with hundreds of Daoist blessings and had drunk the blood of countless demons.
A passing cloud obscured the moon for a moment, throwing everything into darkness.
When the moon emerged again, I almost cried out.
There, in the courtyard, was the most beautiful lady I had ever seen.
She had on a flowing white silk dress with billowing sleeves and a wide, silvery belt. Her face was pale as snow, and her hair dark as coal, draping past her waist. I thought[...]</itunes:summary>

About the Author&#8230;

(taken from http://www.johnjosephadams.com/brave-new-worlds/table-of-contents/red-card-s-l-gilbow/) S. L. Gilbow is a relatively new writer, with five stories published to date, four inThe Magazine of Fantasy &#38; Science Fiction and one in [the] anthology Federations.Gilbow served twenty-six years in the Air Force, and has been on dozens of deployments, and has flown more than 2000 hours as a B-52 navigator. He currently makes his living by teaching English at a public high school in Norfolk, Virginia.
Everyone knows that James Bond has a “license to kill.”  As an international spy, he must sometimes fight for his life. But he’s a trained government employee, specially selected for Her Majesty’s Service.  But could you trust just anyone with a license to kill?
What about your neighbor?
Or your boss?
In fact, what if the government gave everybody one free pass to shoot one person,any person, for whatever reason?
That’s the premise of [this] story.  S. L. Gilbow says that the idea for “Red Card” actually came from a conversation he had with his daughter, Mandy.  “One day after a driver cut me off in heavy traffic, I… turned to my daughter and said, ‘Everyone should be allowed to shoot one person without going to prison.’ My daughter thought for a second then turned to me and said, ‘Dad, if that were true you would have been dead a long time ago.’”

Red Card
by S.L. Gilbow
    Late one April evening, Linda Jackson pulled a revolver from her purse and shot her husband through a large mustard stain in the center of his T-shirt.  The official after incident survey concluded that almost all of Merry Valley approved of the shooting.  Sixty-four percent of the townspeople even rated her target selection as “excellent.”  A few, however, criticized her, pointing out that shooting your husband is “a little too obvious” and “not very creative.”
Dick Andrews, who had farmed the fertile soil around Merry Valley for over thirty years, believed that Larry Jackson, more than anyone else in town, needed to be killed.  “I never liked him much,” he wrote in the additional comments section of the incident survey.  “He never seemed to have a good word to say about anybody.”
“Excellent use of a bullet,” scrawled Jimmy Blanchard.  Born and raised in Merry Valley, he had known Larry for years and had even graduated from high school with him.  “Most overbearing person I’ve ever met.  He deserved what he got.  I’m just not sure why it took so long.”
Of course, a few people made waves.  Jenny Collins seemed appalled.  “I can hardly believe it,” she wrote.  “We used to be much more discerning about who we killed, and we certainly didn’t go around flaunting it the way Linda does.”  Jenny was the old-fashioned kind.
Linda would never have called her actions “flaunting it.”  Of course she knew what to do after shooting Larry.  She had read The Enforcement Handbook from cover to cover six times, poring over it to see if she had missed anything, scrutinizing every nuance.  She had even committed some of the more important passages to memory:  Call the police immediately after executing an enforcement&#8211;Always keep your red card in a safe, dry place&#8211;Never reveal to anyone that you have a red card&#8211;Be proud; you’re performing an important civic duty.
But flaunting it?  No, Lind[...]</itunes:summary>

Lois McMaster Bujold was born 2 November 1949 in Columbus, Ohio. She attended Ohio State University from 1968 to 1972, but didn&#8217;t graduate. She describes her real education as reading five books a week for ten years from the Ohio State University stacks, reading enormous amounts of SF as a teenager, and listening to her father, an engineer. She discovered fandom in 1969, and married fellow fan John Fredric Bujold in 1971 (now recently divorced); they have one son and one daughter.She started writing in 1982, and sold her first story to Twilight Zone in 1985. Then in one glorious moment, Baen bought all three of the novels she had already written. All three were published in 1986.She has won four Hugo awards in the Novel category, more than any other writer except for Robert A Heinlein, (excluding his Retro Hugo) and yet many SF readers have never heard of her!Lois was on the Locus Recommended Reading list with Falling Free, Brothers In Arms, Mountains of Mourning, Labyrinth, Barrayar and Mirror Dance. She won the Locus Award for Barrayar, Mirror Dance and Paladin of Souls.She won the Nebula Award for Falling Free and The Mountains of Mourning.

About the Author&#8230;
He sold his first story to Talebones Magazine in 2000 and won the Writers of the Future contest in 2004.  His quirky, offbeat fiction continues to show up in various magazines and anthologies like Polyphony 6, Weird Tales and Clarkesworld Magazine.In 2006, his short story &#8220;Of Metal Men and Scarlet Thread and Dancing with the Sunrise&#8221; appeared in the August issue of Realms of Fantasy.  Later that year, inspired by Allen Douglas&#8217;s uncanny painting of Isaak and taunted by his friends and family to finally write a novel, Ken extended that story and Lamentation was born.  Lamentation is the first in a five book series from Tor Books called The Psalms of Isaak. Ken lives near Portland, Oregon, with his amazing wonder-wife Jen West Scholes and twin daughters:  Elizabeth Kathleen and Rachel Ann. He invites readers to contact him through the website or through his blog.  When he&#8217;s not writing, Ken loses himself in Story elsewhere or sings Paul Simon songs to his immoveable cats.



About the Narrator&#8230;
Bill started voice acting on the Metamor City Podcast, and has wanted to do more ever since.  He spends his days working at a library, where he is in charge of all things with plugs and troubleshooting the people who use them.  He spends his nights with his wife, two active children, and two overly active canines and all that goes with that.






Making My Entrance Again With My Usual Flair
by Ken Scholes


No one ever asks a clown at the end of his life what he really wanted to be when he grew up. It’s fairly obvious. No one gets hijacked into the circus. We race to it, the smell of hotdogs leading us in, our fingers aching for the sticky pull of taffy, the electric shock of pink cotton on our tongue. Ask a lawyer and he’ll say when he was a kid he wanted to be an astronaut. Ask an accountant; he’ll say he wanted to be fireman.
I am a clown. I have always wanted to be a clown. And I will die a clown if I have my way.
My name is Merton D. Kamal.
The Kamal comes from my father. I never met the man so I have no idea how he came by it. Mom got the Merton bit from some monk she used to read who wrote something like this: We learn humility by being humiliated often. Given how easily (and how frequently) Kamal is pronounced Camel, and given how the D just stands for D, you can see that she wanted her only child to be absolutely filled to the brim with humility.
My Mom is a deeply spiritual woman.
But enough about her. This is my story.
“Merton,” the ringmaster and owner Rufus P. Stowell said, “it’s just not working out.”
I was pushing forty. I’d lost some weight and everyone knows kids love a chubby clown. I’d also taken up drinking which didn’t go over well right before a show. So suddenly, I found myself without prospects and I turned myself towards home, riding into Seattle by bus on a cold November night.
Mom met me at the bus stop. She had no business driving but she came out anyway. She was standing on the sidewalk next to the station wagon when she saw me. We hugged.
“I’m glad you’re home,” she said.
I lifted my bag into the back. “Thanks.”
“Are you hungry?”
“Not really.”
We went to Denny’s anyway. Whenever my Mom wanted to talk, we went to Denny’s. It’s where she took me to tell me about boys and girls, it’s where she took me to tell me that my dog had been hit by a car.
“So what are you going to do now?” She cut and speared a chunk of meatloaf, then dipped it into her mashed potatoes and gravy before raising it to her mouth.
“I don’t know,” I said. “I guess I’ll fatten up, quit drinking, get back into the business.” I watched her left eyebrow twitch—a sure sign of disapproval. I hefted my double bacon cheeseburger, then paused. “Why? What do you think I should do?”
She leaned forward. She brought her wrinkled hand u[...]</itunes:summary>

Cerbo un Vitra ujo
By Mary Robinette Kowal

Grete snipped a diseased branch off her Sunset-Glory rosebush like she was a body harvester looking for the perfect part. Behind the drone of the garden&#8217;s humidifiers, she caught a woosh-snick as the airlock door opened. Her boyfriend barreled around Mom&#8217;s prize Emperor artichoke.
Something was wrong.
The whites showed around Kaj&#8217;s remarkable eyes, a blue-green so iridescent they seemed to dull all the plants around them. &#8220;Mom and Dad got me a Pass to a down-planet school!&#8221;
The blood congealed in her veins. Kaj would leave her. Grete forced a smile. &#8220;That&#8217;s the outer limit!&#8221;
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t even know they&#8217;d applied. Fairview Academy—game design.&#8221; His perfect teeth flashed like sunshine against the ink of space.
&#8220;It&#8217;s wacking crazed. Should&#8217;ve been you, you&#8217;re a better hack than me.&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;m already entitled to school.&#8221; Grete winced as the words left her mouth. Like he didn&#8217;t know that. He was the middle of five children, way past the Banwith Station family allowance. She picked up the pruning sheers to hide the shake in her hands. How would she live without Kaj? &#8220;So, I guess you got packing to do and stuff.&#8221;
&#8220;They provide uniforms. All I&#8217;m taking is my pod with music and books. Zero else.&#8221; Kaj slid his arm around her waist and laced his long, delicate fingers through hers. &#8220;And I want to spend every moment till launch with you.&#8221;
She loved him so much, it hurt. Grete leaned her head against him, burning the feel of his body into her memory. She breathed in the musky smell of his sweat and kissed his neck, sampling the salt on his skin.
After a moment, Kaj hung a chain around her neck. The metal tags hanging from it were still warm from his body.
&#8220;What?&#8221;
&#8220;Dogtags, like they used in the oldwars. I put all my bios on there so you&#8217;d remember me.&#8221;
&#8220;Kaj Lorensen, don&#8217;t think I could forget you.&#8221;
But if he was away at school, he might forget her. She studied her rosebush and freed the most perfect rose with her sheers. She held it out to him, suddenly shy.
He kissed the rose and then her palm. Grete sank into his gaze, lost in the blue-green of his eyes.
#
Grete buzzed the Lorensen cubby and waited as the comunit scanned her retina for i.d. If her mom knew how to hack into scanner records,  Grete would get major grief for skipping school, but she couldn&#8217;t stand the waiting anymore. Around her, the kids who weren&#8217;t entitled to school played a game of tag in the corridor. She watched to see if any of Kaj&#8217;s younger sibs were there.
The door hissed open. Kaj&#8217;s mother, belly starting to round with another pregnancy, glared at Grete. &#8220;What.&#8221;
&#8220;Sorry, the address I have for Kaj doesn&#8217;t respond.&#8221; A month. She&#8217;d pinged him and waited. Pinged his mom, and waited. She&#8217;d even asked the counselor at her school, but he had never even heard of Fairview Academy. Grete was tired of waiting.
Ms. Lorensen&#8217;s eyes were as flat and grey as her voice. &#8220;You leave him alone. You want to mess this up for him?&#8221;
&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am. I just miss him.&#8221;
&#8220;Maybe he doesn&#8217;t miss you.&#8221; The door hissed shut. Grete stared at the mute door for a moment, and then started looking for Kaj&#8217;s sibs, hoping they would know how to contact him. The older two would be in school, which was where Grete should be, but Kaj&#8217;s younger sibs were not entitled.
On any other station, no parent in their right mind would let their unentitled kids run free, for fear they&#8217;d be taken by a body harvester on a job for some rich-ass client. Banwith Stat[...]</itunes:summary>

Keeping Tabs
By Kenneth Schneyer
I was so excited when I could finally buy a Tab. They cost so much, you know, but I saved up for maybe six months. I waitressed at Antonio&#8217;s in the North End, and let me tell you, it&#8217;s murder on the feet.  Those trays are heavy, too, and Nico screams at everybody the whole shift, not to mention the way you smell after six hours.  But the customers tip really well, and I was able to save up enough money, even after paying rent and stuff.
I could never have gotten a Tab when I was still married to Marc, that shit.  He never liked anything I liked.  When I married him, all I saw was the big brown eyes and the cleft in his chin and the way he could make his voice go down low, so that I felt it all the way down to my knees.  I had to learn the hard way.
Not that I could&#8217;ve afforded a Tab back then, anyway.  The price started coming down just a few years ago, about when Marc broke my front tooth. By that time I couldn&#8217;t go to my mom&#8217;s, because she said I always went back to that shit anyway, and she wasn&#8217;t going to help me do it again, and my friend Lila wouldn&#8217;t let me stay with her either, same reason. So I went to a shelter, and the police came, and we got a restraining order on Marc.  But yeah, the same damn thing happened, he gave me that look with those eyes and told me how things were really, really going to change this time, because he&#8217;d seen the light and couldn&#8217;t believe he&#8217;d done something like that to me, and like an asshole, I dropped the charges and lifted the restraining order and went back to him.
Two years ago, right after I divorced Marc, Pearl Moulton started playing Mandi Trenton on _Dark Little Corners_, which was her first really big break, and they announced that there&#8217;d be a Tab on her.  I wanted it as soon as I saw her on the show, because Mandi is so awesome; she&#8217;s this really tough girl who works in a bar, and she gives as good as she gets, and she never gives up on love when all these guys leave her all the time. And Pearl Moulton is so beautiful and talented; I used to watch her on _Deception_, when nobody paid her any attention. Now she was in all the magazines, and she&#8217;s exactly my age, and she was Tabbed.
But then my mom got sick, and I was taking care of her for two months. My brother Johnny didn&#8217;t do squat, and his wife Nadine, forget it. So I wasn&#8217;t able to get the Tab until she got better.  That was last year, in May.
I got the injection and the ear cuff, went home and waited for Pearl Moulton&#8217;s Tab time, which was ten to twelve, Eastern. I was so excited I couldn&#8217;t sit down; I kept making cups of coffee and forgetting to drink them, picking up the _Herald_ and reading stuff I&#8217;d already read. Finally it was ten, and I sat down in the recliner and turned on the cuff.
First thing, while it was making the connection, it was like I didn&#8217;t have a body at all &#8212; no sight, no sound, no feeling, nothing. It&#8217;s a good thing your body breathes by itself, because I couldn&#8217;t even tell if I was.  Then, all of a sudden, wham, I was in this padded chair, and I had Pearl Moulton&#8217;s body. She&#8217;s a lot thinner than I am, and her teeth are really straight, and you feel those things right away. At first there was no sound and I couldn&#8217;t see anything, but there was this sweet smell, and something soft brushing down over my face, that is, her face.
Then a girl&#8217;s voice said, &#8220;Okay, done,&#8221; and Pearl opened her eyes and blew out through her nose, like there was dust in it.  She was sitting in a swivel chair in front of a big mirror like they have at a salon, with vanity bulbs all around it.  In the mirror Pearl looked exactly like Mandi Trenton on _Dark [...]</itunes:summary>

Trixie and the Pandas of Dread
by Eugie Foster
Trixie got out of her cherry-red godmobile and waved away the flitting cherubim waiting to bear her to her sedan chair. She wasn&#8217;t in the mood for a reverent chorus of hosannas, and the sedan chair desperately needed re-springing. She felt every jostle and jounce from those damned pandas. A day didn&#8217;t pass that she didn&#8217;t regret adopting giant pandas as her sacred vahanas. Sure, it seemed like a good idea at the time. They were so cute with their roly-poly bellies and black-masked faces, but they were wholly unsuited to be beasts of conveyance. The excessive undulation of their waddling gaits was enough to make Captain Ahab seasick, and their exclusive diet of bamboo made them perpetually flatulent. The novelty of being hauled along by farting ursines in a stomach-roiling sedan chair had gotten very old very fast. But there wasn&#8217;t a lot she could do about it now. It was all about the brand. Pandas were part of her theology. If she adopted new vahanas, she&#8217;d likely end up with a splitter faction, possibly even a reformation. Such a pain in the ass.
So she&#8217;d started walking more—well, floating really, since gods weren&#8217;t supposed to tread the earth. Appearances and all.
Drifting a hairsbreadth above the pavement, Trixie pulled out her holy tablet and launched the Karmic Retribution app. The first thumbnail belonged to a Mr. Tom Ehler, the owner of the walkway and the two-story colonial house it led to. She unpinched two fingers across the screen to zoom up Mr. Ehler&#8217;s details.
Yesterday, Mr. Ehler, under the handle GodnessWins, had posted on a public forum a series of inflammatory comments in response to a YouTube video depicting a street fight. His sins were a nearly perfect fit for the specifications she&#8217;d told the app to flag, right down to the secondary parameters (Mr. Ehler&#8217;s toxic vitriol was also egregiously ungrammatical). But even reading, &#8220;yo n***rs, whiteman gave u freedom whiteman take it away&#8221; and &#8220;f**king street monkey deserved to get hang from a tree like the good old days,&#8221; only made Trixie feel tired. Where was the seething indignation? The fiery wrath and burning rage?
She knocked on the hardwood door, admiring the architecture as she waited. It was a pretty swank piece of real estate, red brick with whitewashed wooden trim. Definitely upscale.
The door opened at her fourth knock. The man glaring at her matched his profile headshot—receding hairline, thickening gut, age spots beginning to speckle his face—but she didn&#8217;t need the app to confirm his identity. Her omniscience had kicked in.
&#8220;What you want, missy? Knocking on decent people&#8217;s door this time of night?&#8221;
Trixie didn&#8217;t bother with any theatrical pyrotechnics or a &#8220;repent now&#8221; spiel. She just punched her fist into Tom Ehler&#8217;s chest and yanked out a handful of viscera. He collapsed, spraying blood and choking on his own bile. With disinterest, she watched him flail and shriek before calling down a white-hot levin bolt to finish him off.
She sighed. Yeah, it was still satisfying, ridding the world of another dickhead, but something was missing. Trixie had been a god for so long she barely remembered the time when she&#8217;d been mortal, just an earnest supplicant imploring the deities to smite sinners in the name of justice and an offended sense of _Why hasn&#8217;t this asshole been horribly maimed or engulfed in hellfire yet?_ She did remember her euphoric rapture when the Karma Committee appeared at her door with an oversized certificate of godhood and a bouquet of burning bushes. But she hadn&#8217;t felt anything but a plodding sense of duty for a long time.

PERSPECTIVE
By Jake Kerr&#160;
The worst part about picking my son up from the police station was the walk to get there. I hadn’t been outside in years, but it was still the same&#8211;the drab gray of the smog-stained overcast sky, the decaying concrete, the stench of gasoline, urine, and who knew what else. But thanks to Jeffrey there was a new assault to my senses&#8211;black molecular paint permanently defacing an already wretched city.With every step I could see his work&#8211;his “tags” as the police called them. They were all different, and there was no rhyme or reason as to what he would vandalize&#8211;the sides of buildings, street surfaces, retailer kiosks, even windows. The randomness made catching my son a difficult task for the police, but catch him they did, and now I had to walk these vile streets to bring him home.
I paid the bail, followed the directions to processing, and waited for my son. The policewoman there was polite and offered me a seat, but I stood. I wasn’t in the mood to relax, and Jeffrey needed to see how angry I was. So I waited, arms behind my back, staring at the door that led inside.
His head hung low as he walked out. He glanced up at me and then lowered his head again. “Hi, Pop,” he mumbled. I didn’t move. He walked over and added in a whisper, “I’m really sorry.”
“You lied to me.” I grabbed his right hand and pulled it up between us. “These black stains aren’t paint, Jeffrey. That is your _skin_. It was the price to pay for your job, you said. I’m painting ships with a new kind of paint, you said. You made the stains sound like a worthy sacrifice.” I tossed his hand down.
“Pop, please. Let’s talk about this at home.” He looked around the room, shifting from one foot to the other.
“Yes, we will discuss this at home.” I turned and walked out the door. He followed. I walked the streets again, Jeffrey shuffling behind me. I focused on the concrete at my feet, unable to bear looking at his work. My hands were clenched tight enough to turn my knuckles white, so I shoved them in my pockets.

###
I closed the door and set all the locks. I couldn’t remember the last time I had left the apartment for the drab world outside, and I did not intend to do it again.  Jeffrey followed me in as I sat in my media chair and stood near the door. The distance felt greater than the span of a room. At least he was quiet and respectful. I sighed.
“The lies are what bother me the most, Jeffrey.”
He stiffened. “I never lied.”
I frowned and raised my voice. “You never lied? You said you were working at the shipyards!”
“I did work there. I painted ships.”
“Did you, now? Or were you defacing them in the middle of the night?” I pounded my hand on the arm of the chair. “I was sad, but I was still proud of you, Jeffrey. All those art lessons. All those awards. That you couldn’t make a living with your art broke me up inside. But to see you finally turn your art into industry, even if it required your hands to be stained that horrible coal black, that was a price I could at least understand. You were doing something meaningful.”
As I shook my head, he interjected, “I am doing something meaningful, Pop.” His voice rose. “You just don’t understand!”
“Painting permanent black marks across the city is not meaningful. This ‘tagging’ that the police told me about. It’s a mark of pride, they said. A way for gangs and others to know that this is your city.” I closed my eyes and lowered my head. “I thought I had raised you better.”
“Pop, I wish I could explain, but I’m not done. When I am, you will understand.” He looked so earnest and so sad. I stared at him, and he lowered his head. Despite his hope, I knew I would never understand. How could I? He was marching off to scar the city again, and he expected me to just accept it. I couldn’t.
I stood up. “Not done? You[...]</itunes:summary>

&#160;
Finished
by Robert Reed 
What did I plan?  Very little, in truth.  An evening walk accompanied by the scent of flowers and dampened earth, the lingering heat of the day taken as a reassurance, ancient and holy.  I was genuinely happy, as usual.  Like a hundred other contented walkers, I wandered through the linear woods, past lovers’ groves and pocket-sized sanctuaries and ornamental ponds jammed full of golden orfes and platinum lungfish.  When I felt as if I should be tired, I sat on a hard steel bench to rest.  People smiled as they passed, or they didn’t smile.  But I showed everyone a wide grin, and sometimes I offered a pleasant word, and one or two of the strangers paused long enough to begin a brief conversation.
One man—a rather old man, and I remember little else—asked, “And how are you today?”
Ignoring the implication, I said, “Fine.”
I observed, “It’s a very pleasant evening.”
“Very pleasant,” he agreed.
My bench was near a busy avenue, and sometimes I would study one of the sleek little cars rushing past.
“The end of a wonderful day,” he continued.
I looked again at his soft face, committing none of it to memory.  But I kept smiling, and with a tone that was nothing but polite, I remarked, “The sun’s setting earlier now.  Isn’t it?”
The banal recognition of a season’s progression—that was my only intent.  But the face colored, and then with a stiff, easy anger, the man said, “What does it matter to you?  It’s always the same day, after all.”
Hardly.  Yet I said nothing.
He eventually grew tired of my silence and wandered off.  With a memory as selective as it is graceful, I tried to forget him.  But since I’m talking about him now, I plainly didn’t succeed.  And looking back on the incident, I have to admit that the stranger perhaps had some little role in what happened next.
I planned nothing.
But a keen little anger grabbed me, and I rose up from the bench, and like every pedestrian before me, I followed the path to the edge of the avenue.  Later, I was told that I looked like someone lost in deep thoughts, and I suppose I was.  Yet I have no memory of the moment.  According to witnesses, I took a long look up the road before stepping forwards with my right foot.  The traffic AI stabbed my eyes with its brightest beam, shouting, “Go back!”  But I stepped forwards again, without hesitation, plunging directly into the oncoming traffic.
A little pink Cheetah slammed on its brakes.  But it was an old car with worn pads—a little detail that couldn’t have found its way into my calculations—and despite the heroic efforts of its AI pilot, the car was still moving at better than eighty kilometers an hour when it shattered my hip and threw my limp body across the hood, my chest and then my astonished face slamming into the windshield’s flexing glass.
Again, I tumbled.
Then I found myself sprawled in a heap on the hot pavement.
For a thousand years, I lay alone.  Then a single face appeared, scared and sorry and pale and beautiful.  Gazing down through the mayhem, she said, “Oh, God.  Oh, shit!”
With my battered mouth, I said, “Hello.”
Leaking a sloppy laugh, I told her, “No, really, I’ll be fine.”
Then I asked, “What’s your name?”
“Careless,” she said.  “Stupid,” she said.  And then she said, “Or Bonnie.  Take your pick.”
#
I picked Bonnie.
A beautiful young woman, she had short dark hair arranged in a fetching fish-scale pattern and a sweet face made with bright brown eyes and skin that looked too smooth and clear to be skin.  On most occasions, her smile came easily, but it could be a crooked smile laced with weariness and a gentle sadness.  There was a girlish lightness to her voice, but in difficult circumstances, that voice and the pretty face were capable of surprising strength.  “What should I do?” she asked the crumbled figure at her feet.  “What [...]</itunes:summary>

“The Very Pulse of the Machine”
by Michael Swanwick
Click.
The radio came on.
“Hell.”
Martha kept her eyes forward, concentrated on walking. Jupiter to one shoulder, Daedalus&#8217;s plume to the other. Nothing to it. Just trudge, drag, trudge, drag. Piece of cake.
“Oh.”
She chinned the radio off.
Click.
“Hell. Oh. Kiv. El. Sen.”
“Shut up, shut up, shut up!” Martha gave the rope an angry jerk, making the sledge carrying Burton&#8217;s body jump and bounce on the sulfur hardpan. “You&#8217;re dead, Burton, I&#8217;ve checked, there&#8217;s a hole in your faceplate big enough to stick a fist through, and I really don&#8217;t want to crack up. I&#8217;m in kind of a tight spot here and I can&#8217;t afford it, okay? So be nice and just shut the f*** up.”
“Not. Bur. Ton.”
“Do it anyway.”
She chinned the radio off again.
Jupiter loomed low on the western horizon, big and bright and beautiful and, after two weeks on Io, easy to ignore. To her left, Daedalus was spewing sulfur and sulfur dioxide in a fan two hundred kilometers high. The plume caught the chill light from an unseen sun and her visor rendered it a pale and lovely blue. Most spectacular view in the universe, and she was in no mood to enjoy it.
Click.
Before the voice could speak again, Martha said, “I am not going crazy, you&#8217;re just the voice of my subconscious, I don&#8217;t have the time to waste trying to figure out what unresolved psychological conflicts gave rise to all this, and I am not going to listen to anything you have to say.”
Silence.

The moonrover had flipped over at least five times before crashing sideways against a boulder the size of the Sydney Opera House. Martha Kivelsen, timid groundling that she was, was strapped into her seat so tightly that when the universe stopped tumbling, she&#8217;d had a hard time unlatching the restraints. Juliet Burton, tall and athletic, so sure of her own luck and agility that she hadn&#8217;t bothered, had been thrown into a strut.
The vent-blizzard of sulfur dioxide snow was blinding, though. It was only when Martha had finally crawled out from under its raging whiteness that she was able to look at the suited body she&#8217;d dragged free of the wreckage.
She immediately turned away.
Whatever knob or flange had punched the hole in Burton&#8217;s helmet had been equally ruthless with her head.
Where a fraction of the vent-blizzard—“lateral plumes” the planetary geologists called them—had been deflected by the boulder, a bank of sulfur dioxide snow had built up. Automatically, without thinking, Martha scooped up double-handfuls and packed them into the helmet. Really, it was a nonsensical thing to do; in a vacuum, the body wasn&#8217;t about to rot. On the other hand, it hid that face.
Then Martha did some serious thinking.
For all the fury of the blizzard, there was no turbulence. Because there was no atmosphere to have turbulence in. The sulfur dioxide gushed out straight from the sudden crack that had opened in the rock, falling to the surface miles away in strict obedience to the laws of ballistics. Most of what struck the boulder they&#8217;d crashed against would simply stick to it, and the rest would be bounced down to the ground at its feet. So that—this was how she&#8217;d gotten out in the first place—it was possible to crawl under the near-horizontal spray and back to the ruins of the moonrover. If she went slowly, the helmet light and her sense of feel ought to be sufficient for a little judicious salvage.
Martha got down on her hands and knees. And as she did, just as quickly as the blizzard had begun—it stopped.
She stood, feeling strangely foolish.
Still, she couldn&#8217;t rely on the blizzard staying quiescent. Bet[...]</itunes:summary>

The Tamarisk Hunter
by Paolo Bacigalupi

 “The Tamarisk Hunter” originally appeared in the environmental journal High Country News. It was inspired by the only thing that really matters in the Western U.S. — water.
A big tamarisk can suck 73,000 gallons of river water a year. For $2.88 a day, plus water bounty, Lolo rips tamarisk all winter long.
Ten years ago, it was a good living. Back then, tamarisk shouldered up against every riverbank in the Colorado River Basin, along with cottonwoods, Russian olives, and elms. Ten years ago, towns like Grand Junction and Moab thought they could still squeeze life from a river.
Lolo stands on the edge of a canyon, Maggie the camel his only companion. He stares down into the deeps. It’s an hour’s scramble to the bottom. He ties Maggie to a juniper and starts down, boot-skiing a gully. A few blades of green grass sprout neon around him, piercing juniper-tagged snow clods. In the late winter, there is just a beginning surge of water down in the deeps; the ice is off the river edges. Up high, the mountains still wear their ragged snow mantles. Lolo smears through mud and hits a channel of scree, sliding and scattering rocks. His jugs of tamarisk poison gurgle and slosh on his back. His shovel and rockbar snag on occasional junipers as he skids by. It will be a long hike out. But then, that’s what makes this patch so perfect. It’s a long way down, and the riverbanks are largely hidden.

It’s a living; where other people have dried out and blown away, he has remained: a tamarisk hunter, a water tick, a stubborn bit of weed. Everyone else has been blown off the land as surely as dandelion seeds, set free to fly south or east, or most of all north where watersheds sometimes still run deep and where even if there are no more lush ferns or deep cold fish runs, at least there is still water for people.
Eventually, Lolo reaches the canyon bottom. Down in the cold shadows, his breath steams.
He pulls out a digital camera and starts shooting his proof. The Bureau of Reclamation has gotten uptight about proof. They want different angles on the offending tamarisk, they want each one photographed before and after, the whole process documented, GPS’d, and uploaded directly by the camera. They want it done on-site. And then they still sometimes come out to spot check before they calibrate his headgate for water bounty.
But all their due diligence can’t protect them from the likes of Lolo. Lolo has found the secret to eternal life as a tamarisk hunter. Unknown to the Interior Department and its BuRec subsidiary, he has been seeding new patches of tamarisk, encouraging vigorous brushy groves in previously cleared areas. He has hauled and planted healthy root balls up and down the river system in strategically hidden and inaccessible corridors, all in a bid for security against the swarms of other tamarisk hunters that scour these same tributaries. Lolo is crafty. Stands like this one, a quarter-mile long and thick with salt-laden tamarisk, are his insurance policy.
Documentation finished, he unstraps a folding saw, along with his rockbar and shovel, and sets his poison jugs on the dead salt bank. He starts cutting, slicing into the roots of the tamarisk, pausing every 30 seconds to spread Garlon 4 on the cuts, poisoning the tamarisk wounds faster than they can heal. But some of the best tamarisk, the most vigorous, he uproots and sets aside, for later use.
$2.88 a day, plus water bounty.
* * *
It takes Maggie’s rolling bleating camel stride a week to make it back to Lolo’s homestead. They follow the river, occasionally climbing above it onto cold mesas or wandering off into the open desert in a bid to avoid the skeleton sprawl of emptied towns. Guardie choppers buzz up and down the river like swarms of angry yellow jackets, hunting fo[...]</itunes:summary>

The First Book of Flaccid Swords
by Edward Cowan
It was a snake&#8211;and Gods, what a snake it was. Fifty feet from sweeping tail to flicking tongue, its eyes as cold as deepest space and dim as the farthest star, its fangs dripping poison so vile the stench alone would kill a lesser man.
This, then, was the dreaded Doom of Lla Haathra, into whose black maw the unlucky and damned were fed to the Impotent God. Never having counted myself among His faithful, I saw no reason to submit meekly to His wrath.
His priests had made one crushing mistake when they lured me onto the trap door: they failed to relieve me of my blade. _Wind,_ they called it, those for whom that name was the last word to leave their lips. I rushed the foul altar, upon which lay my Darinda, black chains coiling about her supple form, her body purest alabaster against the crimson stone marbling her flesh. Tsutu Kalai, highest of the wretched priests, cackled as I approached, throwing the lever that opened the trap. Darinda&#8217;s scream followed me down the endless, serpentine flue. Beyond that, darkness.
Rolling to my feet, I stood in the shaft of light piercing the abyss from the chamber above, Wind held before me, daring the almost tangible shadow to draw near. Within moments came a rasping omen, as of a great mass dragging itself awake after a slumber of eons.
Now the Doom reared before me, thrusting its head into the light. We goaded one another to strike&#8211;it with the insolence of the predator that has never known failure, I with a rage that would never be clenched till the serpent&#8217;s blood coated my blade from point to pommel. From above echoed the laughter of the priests and the muffled screams of my Darinda. Here there was only silence&#8211;the sweet anticipation of the moment before death.
Finally I saluted the beast with a nod and spoke: &#8220;At least your masters have granted me a worthy adversary. Very well; let us have at it. I will not pretend to the ancient patience of the serpentfolk.&#8221;
It hissed its reply.
At that I lunged. Its mammoth head darted forward quicker than mercury, but primal speed avails not against human cunning. I ducked its strike and gripped my blade for the piercing jab: up under the jaw and through the skull. I sprang up, mighty thews tensing for the killing blow&#8211;
And found myself holding a wet noodle.
BREAK
Static shrieks as Jessica tears off her headgear and hurls it to the floor. Test pattern jackhammers my eyes and ears.
That&#8217;s the thing about couples therapy: when one quits, she drags the other with her. And you can&#8217;t do it unless you do it together.
Repeat ad nauseam and there&#8211;you&#8217;ve got a bead on the entire experience.
She glares at me from her couch. &#8220;You died _again,_ didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
BREAK
Clearing his throat, Dr. Freundlich removes his own headgear with none of his patients&#8217; violent frustration. He regards us across the vast mahogany plane of his desk, steepling his fingertips, tap-tap-tapping them together.
&#8220;We are not making the progress we had hoped for, hmm?&#8221;
Jessica and I shift on our couches&#8211;the same vivid red as Lla Haathra&#8217;s altar&#8211;searching for comfort or at least a spot of dignity in what she calls the &#8220;birthing position&#8221;: feet level with head, ankles parted. This posture is designed for optimum relaxation, says the doctor. I say it&#8217;s designed to keep us permanently at bay; from these positions we gaze up at him as children to father.
Jessica shushes me when I mutter things like that, but the doctor doesn&#8217;t disagree. _It is in fact necessary; in the realm of the neue psychology, patients no longer want friends or confidants. In these times of broken homes, late marriage and early divorce, they desire discipline, orde[...]</itunes:summary>

They Go Bump
By David Barr Kirtley

     Ball placed his feet carefully. Walking on rough terrain was treacherous when you couldn&#8217;t see your feet &#8212; or your legs, for that matter, or any part of yourself. All he could see was the uneven ground, the shady stones outlined with sharp sunlight, drifting eerily beneath him. His boot caught and twisted, and he pitched forward, falling and smacking his elbows rough against the ground.
From somewhere up on the hilltop, Cataldo&#8217;s voice laughed. That voice &#8212; smooth and measured, with just a hint of sharpness. Ball had never paid much attention to voices before, but now voices were all he had.
Cataldo&#8217;s shouted, &#8220;Was that you, Ball? Again?&#8221;
Ball groped on the ground for his rifle. He felt it, grasped it, and slung it over his shoulder. He clambered to his feet, and wavered there a few moments, unsteady.
Cataldo&#8217;s voice again: &#8220;How many times is that now? Twelve?&#8221;
&#8220;Eleven.&#8221; Ball groaned, stretched, and looked around. &#8220;Where are you?&#8221;
&#8220;By the rock.&#8221;
Ball sighed. The rock. There was nothing but rocks, nothing but rolling expanses of rocks and more rocks, stretching to the horizon in every direction. The orange sky was littered with rocks, too, rocky moons. &#8220;Which rock?&#8221;
&#8220;The big, triangular one.&#8221;
Ball squinted up the hill.
&#8220;See the tall peak?&#8221; Cataldo&#8217;s voice prompted. &#8220;Follow the gully down. There&#8217;s a patch of boulders, and then at the edge of those there&#8217;s this big, triangular &#8211;&#8221;
&#8220;All right, I see it.&#8221; Ball took a deep breath. &#8220;I&#8217;m coming.&#8221;
He scrambled over the boulders and picked his way carefully among smaller stones. He tried to picture Cataldo&#8217;s face &#8212; slick black hair, long, narrow face, oversized nose. Ball hadn&#8217;t seen that face all day. Now there was just the voice. &#8220;OK, I&#8217;m here,&#8221; he breathed, finally.
The empty spot of nothingness that was Cataldo said, &#8220;Where&#8217;s Sweezy?&#8221;
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; Ball shook his head, though he realized Cataldo couldn&#8217;t see it anyway. &#8220;He hasn&#8217;t said anything all day. I&#8217;ve tried talking to him.&#8221;
Cataldo groaned. &#8220;Sweezy! Hey, Sweezy! Where are you?&#8221;
The vast plains of boulders were stony and silent. There was no answer.
&#8220;He might have fallen behind,&#8221; Ball said. &#8220;Maybe he got lost, or hurt his ankle.&#8221;
&#8220;He&#8217;s out there. Goddamnit, Sweezy! Sound off.&#8221;
Finally, a plaintive voice, from far down in the rockslide, called out, &#8220;I&#8217;m here. What?&#8221;
Sweezy. His voice tended to waver as he spoke. It always seemed tired and prickly, that voice. Ball shouted, &#8220;We&#8217;re checking to make sure you&#8217;re still with us.&#8221;
&#8220;Just go,&#8221; Sweezy&#8217;s voice said. &#8220;I can take care of myself.&#8221;
Cataldo grunted in disgust, and said to Ball, &#8220;Come on. Let&#8217;s catch up with the others.&#8221;
Ball turned wearily, and moved to follow. He walked in the direction he thought Cataldo had gone.
Invisible soldiers. Ball chuckled tiredly. Invisible soldiers on an important mission, invisible soldiers with invisible feet.
He tripped again, and fell.
The week before, Ball had been safe, tucked far underground in the winding, humid, steel &#8212; rimmed tunnels of Fort Deep. He had been sitting on a hard bench outside Captain Schemmer&#8217;s office.
They were giving Ball a mission; he wondered if he was going to die. Cataldo had come and gone already, but Sweezy was still in there. Ball could [...]</itunes:summary>

About the author&#8230;
Mark is an ex-rocket scientist with a doctorate in physics so has an unwitting talent for taking the magic out of twinkling stars, sunsets, colourful flames dancing in a roaring fire, and rainbows.
His medium term aims are to introduce other fathers to the world of creative storytelling, and to find his feet with short story writing. This will involve him having to appreciate that what he sees as funny does not always accord with other people&#8217;s points of view.
Christchurch, New Zealand has been his home for 10 years with all the ups and downs that entails.

Elias Smith and Jones
By Mark English

Every space in the four thousand seat lecture theatre was taken. Additional folk had snuck in to sit on the dark steps at the back. With everyone whispering discretely, the noise was deafening to the grizzled old-timer who stood leaning on the lecturn at the front—or it would have been except for the myPod player earbuds delivering their tinny frantic bluegrass tunes into his head. He chuckled to himself as he looked up at the wall of people in front of him. Political leaders, military leaders, space systems engineers; all desperate to hear the words of an aged ship’s monkey from the Frontier. All because he and his co-conspirators had blackmailed the solar system.
Elias chuckled to himself again. Who would have figured things would have turned out so? He plucked the ear buds out. Instant silence. The university had scored a coup in convincing one of the Sundance gang to tell their tale since any spaceway robbers were generally executed. However the Sundance gang had a thirty year old secret, one that everyone wanted. With the removal of the first earbud old Elias had indicated he was ready to start; all the spectators held their breath.
Elias turned his face up to the watchers, felt the bright lights warming his face, and smiled a toothy grin. “Howdy folks, I’m good an’ pleased to be here today, to see so many notables amongst you. Some I have met before.” A five star general shuffled uncomfortably in his seat as if the warm smile made him sweat—which it did. Elias continued in his soft southern-states patois. “We are gathered here today to hear a story, so let’s go back thirty years, back to when I was even more good lookin’. My partners and I had just obtained a large cargo of rare earth metals from an asteroid cargo waggon, and this had been mistak’n for a robbery. I guess after these years I gotta ‘fess up and say that it sure as hell was a robbery!” Elias leaned forward and grinned at the Sheriff-Admiral in the front row like he was about to lay a golden egg—which as history showed he had (in a manner of speaking). The Sheriff-Admiral returned a tight grimace filled with thirty years of difficult restraint.
###
Elias Earnbuckle leaned on his broom next to Captain Miriam Smith and Jones-the-gun as they looked through the rear viewing port. The star field was tremendous with Sol out of view. The nearest asteroids shone starkly black and white, with sunlight flooding them edge-on. However it was Mars that held their attention. Or more correctly, it was the glow from the foldspace-prow of the rapidly approaching sheriff’s pursuit boat with Mars as a back-drop, that garnered their attention.
Smith leaned her weight onto her left leg and crossed her arms. “That was a quick response.” Elias and Jones grunted in unison. Jones as man-at-arms was second in command and Elias, as general gopher and do-all, was the ship’s rat and the closest thing the gang had ever had to an engineer.
Jones unconsciously mimicked his boss, placing his weight on his left leg and crossing his heavily muscled arms over a chest designed to awe folk [...]</itunes:summary>

Punk Voyager
By Shaenon K. Garrity

Punk Voyager was built by punks.  They made it from beer cans, razors, safety pins, and a surfboard some D-bag had left on the beach. Also plutonium.  Where did they get plutonium?  Around.  f*** you.
The punks who built Punk Voyager were Johnny Bonesaw, Johnny Razor, Mexican Johnny D-bag, Red Viscera, and some other guys.  No, asshole, nobody remembers what other guys.  They were f***ing wasted, these punks.  They&#8217;d been drinking on the San Diego beach all day and night, talking about making a run to Tijuana and then forgetting and punching each other.  They&#8217;d built a fire on the beach, and all night the fire went up and went down while the punks threw beer cans at the seagulls.
Forget the s*** I just said, it wasn&#8217;t the punks who did it.  They were f***ing punks.  The hell they know about astro-engineering? Truth is that Punk Voyager was the strung-out masterpiece of Mexican Johnny D-bag&#8217;s girlfriend, Lacuna, who had a doctorate in structural engineering.  Before she burned out and ran for the coast, Lacuna was named Alice McGuire and built secret nuclear submarines for a government contractor in Ohio.  It sucked.  But that was where she got the skills to construct an unmanned deep-space probe.  Same principle, right?  Keep the radiation in and the water out.  Or the vacuum of space, whatever, it&#8217;s all the same s*** to an engineer.
f*** that, it wasn&#8217;t really Lacuna&#8217;s baby.  It wasn&#8217;t her idea.  The idea was Red&#8217;s.
“f***ing space,” he said that fateful night.  He was lying on his back looking up at space, is why he said it.
“Hell yeah,” said Johnny Bonesaw.
“s*** ain&#8217;t nothing but rocks and UFOs.”
“Ain&#8217;t no such thing as a UFO.”
“Like hell there ain&#8217;t,” said Red.  “CIA knows all about it.  Them and the astronauts.”
Red was always saying that s***, though.  Everything was the CIA and the saucer people with that burnout.
“That&#8217;s why they sent up that cigar-box spaceship with the porn in it,” said Red.  “They know there&#8217;s life up there.”
“What spaceship?” said Johnny. “There&#8217;s no f***ing spaceship.”
“He means the Voyager space probe,” said Lacuna. “Which is real, asshole.”
Lacuna was pissing off everyone but Mexican Johnny D-bag with her knowing-s*** routine.  That and eating all the mushrooms and throwing them up in the ocean.
“I want wine,” Johnny Razor yelled down the beach.  “Mexican wine. Weren&#8217;t we going to Tijuana?”
“We already went,” yelled Mexican Johnny D-bag.  “We went without you.  We&#8217;re not even here.”  Then he laughed like a pinhead.  He was on some s***.
“Keep it down,” snapped Lacuna.  “I&#8217;m telling these assholes about the space probe.”
“f*** the space probe,” said Johnny Bonesaw.
“The Voyager 1 space probe,” said Lacuna, “was launched into space to study the gas giants and then continue out beyond the solar system.”
“No s***?”
“Told you it was real,” said Red.  “But the thing is, the important thing is the messages it&#8217;s got in it.  For the space people.  Tell him about the messages.”
Down the beach, Johnny Razor and Mexican Johnny D-bag started punching each other, mostly for something to do.
“Okay, yeah.  Voyager carries a record of stuff from Earth for the aliens to find.”
“And naked pictures.  They put in naked pictures of people.”
“Yeah, whatever, naked pictures.  And photos, different languages, music, stuff like that.”
“Music?” said Johnny Bonesaw.
“What music?” said Red.
“Um.” Lacuna chewed her lip, thinking.  “Beethoven, maybe.  Or Mozart.  You know, classical music.  And tribal stuff, like, from around the world.  And &#8216;Johnny B. Goode.&#8217;”
Johnny Bonesaw and Red stared at her.  They stared up at space.  They stared back at her.
“Chuck Berry?” [...]</itunes:summary>

Concussion
By David Glen Larson

He scrambled from the fire that was snaking through the corridor when another explosion jolted the ship, and just like that he was dead again. A moment later he was someone else, gazing down with another’s eyes at the mangled green body he’d left behind.
Never before had Tyler experienced such terror. Sure, he’d been afraid—afraid his knee would give out again, sidelining him for the big game; afraid he’d let down his teammates and make a fool of himself—but he’d never been terrified of being incinerated in an alien system countless light-years from the home world he was forced to flee. Not until now.
Staring up at the night sky, the stars were dim under the glare of the stadium lights. Which star was theirs? He caught himself and shook his aching head. It was only a dream, after all. The frog people weren’t real.
The doctor shined a penlight into each pupil. “Any headache, nausea, or dizziness?”
“What do you think? I was just hit by a freight train.” Good old Number 32—the biggest, meanest linebacker in the NFL.
“You may have a concussion.”
Coach Landis spit tobacco juice on the grass only inches from Tyler’s head. “We’re down 22-27 in the fourth quarter with under a minute to go. Montoya’s out, Casper’s out, and now you’re saying I’m out my third string too? Uh-uh, Doc. I need Harden in the game.”
“If he takes another hit—”
“A few aches and pains go with the territory,” said the coach.
“Forget aches and pains. I’m talking stroke or death. Those go with the territory?”
“Ordinarily no, but this is the Super Bowl and I’m out of quarterbacks.”
“I can play, Coach.” Tyler rolled onto his knees and wobbled to his feet with a groan. Lights flashed and popped behind his eyes, some internal wiring knocked loose, but he didn’t let on. “I’m fine.”
Tyler teetered backward, but the coach steadied him, pretending to pat him on the back.
“That a boy. See, Doc? It was just a tap.”
“All right, but I’ll need to check his cognitive function after every play.”
“Whatever you say,” said the coach.
“I’m going to ask you to remember a list of five words. If you can’t repeat them back to me, you’re a NO-GO.”
“Apple, wrench, sombrero, parrot, porcupine,” Tyler said with confidence.
“But I didn’t give you the words yet.”
“Sure you did. Last season against the Colts. It was the only time I played. Number 24 clocked me from behind on our 15.”
“Well I’m glad to see your long-term memory isn’t impaired, but it’s your short-term memory that concerns me.”
“Fine, but make it quick. I have a qweetah to win.”
“Beg your pardon?”
“I said, make it quick. I have a game to win.”
#
The clock was frozen with 54 seconds to go, a lifetime on the field.
“This is it, Fellas. Whole country’s watching us. Hell, the whole world. Presidents, kings, grandmothers, your own mothers and kids, and God. Every one of ‘em watching to see if we have what it takes to dig deep and pull out a victory. Let’s not disappoint them.”
They broke with a clap and toed the line of scrimmage, growling, snorting like racehorses waiting to spring from the gate. But the other side showed blitz.
Even if there had been time for the coach to call a new play, they’d been having trouble with the headsets. The broadcast booth had complained about it all night. Something about atmospheric distortion. That left Tyler with only one option. He had to call an audible.
But running through the plays in his head was like slogging through quicksand. He still heard the screams, the frog-peoples’ cries for help. Jagged lightning stabbed into his brain, and he clamped his eyes shut, trying to push them all away. He needed a play. And then he [...]</itunes:summary>

Captain Sandels came in during prep.  &#8220;Falcon,&#8221; he said, but softly, as if he didn&#8217;t want to disturb the techs working on squeezing me into the bomb casing.  I twittered our channel and winked: Kind of busy right now. Something come up?
&#8220;No,&#8221; the captain responded, again so softly that I knew he definitely didn&#8217;t want the techs to overhear.  The only reason I could hear him was that my acoustic enhancements were so sensitive that I could hear a mouse fart from a klick away.  &#8220;I just wanted to wish you luck.&#8221;
For making it back? I answered.  Not likely.
&#8220;That&#8217;s brutal,&#8221; he replied and I heard his pain. &#8220;I thought that, after all we. . .&#8217;
I stopped him there.  I&#8217;m not Falcon; just a revised edition.
&#8220;So it&#8217;s just goodbye, then?&#8221;
Sure.  I closed the channel before he could say anything else.  What I don&#8217;t need now is some damn puzzling reference to a past that no longer concerned me. Better not to dwell on the past.  Given humanity&#8217;s precarious state, sentiment was dangerous.  Besides, I had to concentrate on my scouting mission. We had to learn more about the aliens on the planet below.
I shut everything but the maintenance channel as they oozing the cushioning gel around me.  Its plasticity enfolds me in a warm, soft embrace that creeps into every crack and crevice, sealing me off from sight and sound and every sense save an assurance of my own humanity.  My form might be much reduced, to be sure, but nevertheless I retain my inherent humanity.
&#8220;We&#8217;re closing the lid,&#8221; the tech reports over the maintenance channel.
It&#8217;s time for sleep.  Landing will wake me up.
&#160;
#
The idea behind the drop was dramatic and simple.  Three attack cruisers would carpet bomb the area where the aliens landed.  The drops consisted of ten burrowers, thirty sweepers, and twenty HE bombs from each ship, all distributed to randomly bracket the target. The third, eleventh, and nineteenth bomb of each pod were slow-fuse HE duds, except for the one that contained me.
I woke as soon as the bomb slammed into the ground on an oblique angle.  I was not quite fully awake by the second bounce but fully aware as my container rolled down some piece of bumpy geography, stopped, and rocked for a moment before finding a stable orientation.  I pushed up to pop the hatch and got out, dripping gel over the dented casing of the faux bomb.
I quickly scanned the area around me.  Apparently I&#8217;d tumbled down a steep cliff to come to rest at the bottom among assorted rocks that had fallen from the eroding slope.  I could feel the shock of exploding ordinance through my feet as the delay fuses fired.  That told me that I&#8217;d landed near the center of the distribution.
My empty casing still packed a punch &#8211;enough to fool a casual inspection into thinking it was just another delayed bomb&#8211; and the clock was running.  I moved away to put as much distance as I could between me and the bomb before it &#8211;WHAM&#8211; exploded and threw me tumbling ass over teacup.  Shit!  The techs had set the fuse&#8217;s timer too short.  Well, nothing I could do about that now, but I check my systems to be certain and find that no harm was done.  I am hyper-alert to my surroundings and take note of insect sounds, random wind action on the sparse vegetation, small animal movements, and the trembling ground beneath my feet to establish a baseline of whatever passed for &#8220;normal&#8221; on this planet.  So far, everything agreed with the data the former colonists had provided.
Every ten meters I stop to feel the ground for approaching footfalls.  I am continually sniffing the air for any unusual smell, listening for any sound, and watching for anything that might be artificial. At the same time I was &#8220;lis[...]</itunes:summary>

“You’ve done well,” Creative Director Len Palladon said, looking over Sophia’s résumé.
Sophia squinted in the golden California sun that fell on her through the huge windows of the conference room. She wanted to pinch herself to be sure she wasn’t dreaming. She was here, really here, on the hallowed campus of Semaphore Pictures, in an interview with the legendary Palladon.
She licked her dry lips. “I’ve always wanted to make movies.” She choked back _for Semaphore_. She didn’t want to seem too desperate.
Palladon was in his thirties, dressed in a pair of comfortable shorts and a plain gray t-shirt whose front was covered with the drawing of a man swinging a large hammer over a railroad spike. A pioneer in computer-assisted movie making, he had been instrumental in writing the company’s earliest software and was the director of _The Mesozoic_, Semaphore’s first film.
He nodded and went on, “You won the Zoetrope screenwriting competition, earned excellent grades in both technology and liberal arts, and got great recommendations from your film studies professors. It couldn’t have been easy.”
To Sophia, he seemed a bit pale and tired, as though he had been spending all his time indoors, not out in the golden California sun. She imagined that Palladon and his animators must have been working overtime to meet a deadline: probably to finish the new film scheduled to be released this summer.
“I believe in working hard,” Sophia said. What she really wanted was to tell him that she knew what it meant to stay up all night in front of the editing workstation and wait for the rendering to complete, all for the chance to catch the first glimpse of a vision coming to life on the screen. She was ready.
Palladon took off his reading glasses, smiled at Sophia, and took out a tablet from behind him. He touched its screen and slid it across the table to Sophia. A video was playing on it.
“There was also this fan film, which you didn’t put on your résumé. You made it out of footage cut and spliced from our movies, and it went viral. Several million views in two weeks, right? You gave our lawyers quite a headache.”
Sophia’s heart sank. She had always suspected that this might become a problem. But when the invitation to interview at Semaphore came in her email, she had whooped and hollered, and dared to believe that somehow the executives at Semaphore had missed that little film.
#
Sophia remembered going to _The Mesozoic_. She was seven. The lights dimmed, her parents stopped talking, the first few bars of Semaphore’s signature tune began to play, and she became still.
Over the next two hours, as she sat there in the dark theater, mesmerized by the adventure of the digital characters on that screen, she fell in love. She didn’t know it then, but she would never love a person as much as she loved the company that made her cry and laugh, the company that made _The Mesozoic_.
A Semaphore movie meant something: no, not merely technological prowess in digital animation and computer graphics that were better than life. Sure, these accomplishments were impressive, but it was Semaphore’s consistent ability to tell a great _story_, to make movies with _heart_, to entertain and move the six-year old along with the sixteen-year old and the sixty-year old, that truly made it an icon, a place worthy of being loved.
Sophia saw each of Semaphore’s films hundreds of times. She bought them multiple times, in successive digital formats: discs, compressed downloads, lossless codecs, enhanced and re-enhanced and super-enhanced.
She knew each scene down to the second, could recite every line of dialogue from memory. She didn’t even need the movies themselves any more; she could play them in her head.
She took film studies classes and began to make her own shorts, and she yearned to make them _feel_ as great as the Sem[...]</itunes:summary>

Shutdown
By Corry L. Lee
The alarm blared over the forest&#8217;s metallic rustling, and my HUD&#8217;s red warning light glazed the view through my faceplate. Ten seconds until the defense scan hit my position. Ten seconds until any motion, any electrical signature would whip vines down from the iron-cored trees, wrapping me as surely as steel cables, pinning me while cutter-bugs took me apart.
My muscles clenched, and I froze. The training sims hadn&#8217;t prepared me for the terror twisting my gut, for the way my heart seemed to dance a _pas-de-bourrée_, its ballerina toes rapping against my ribs.
I didn&#8217;t have time to panic. I chinned my skinsuit&#8217;s kill switch and dropped to the forest floor. In the silence after the klaxon died, my breather hissed out one final gasp of oxygen. The red glow faded from my faceplate and the forest closed in, dark without the HUD&#8217;s gain and unnaturally silent without the suit&#8217;s audio pickups. Weak sunlight filtered through the thick canopy, yellowed by sulfur gas, enough to make out shapes but not details. In sims, they&#8217;d cut our visual enhancement, but they must have extrapolated badly because the shadows had never been this deep, the shafts of sunlight never so diseased.
I crouched on a patch of dirt, crumpling fallen leaves but avoiding the forest&#8217;s ragged undergrowth. I folded my legs beneath me, splaying my arms for balance. My hands slipped on the metal-rich berries that covered the ground as if someone had derailed a freight train of ball bearings. I swept some impatiently aside and rested my helmeted forehead on the dirt. How much time had passed? Eight seconds? No time to worry.
Gritting my teeth, I stopped my heart.
A vise seemed to close about my chest. Sweat beaded on my brow as I dragged in one last breath, my body panicking, automatic reflexes screaming at me to fight, to struggle, to escape. I fought them as Sergeant Miller and Captain Johnston trained me, fought them and stopped breathing. My vision narrowed. My lips tingled and went numb. _Twelve minutes_, I repeated to myself as the forest grew dark and disappeared.
_You&#8217;ll come back._ The words echoed in Sergeant Miller&#8217;s clipped bark. Just a few minutes ago he&#8217;d given me the thumbs-up after checking my suit&#8217;s seals. He&#8217;d rapped his knuckles against my helmet for luck, and I&#8217;d stridden toward this forested hell.
#
&#8220;So, Amaechi,&#8221; Private Yaradua said as I topped my glass off from her flask. &#8220;If we were back on Hope&#8217;s Landing, what would you do with your last night?&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;d go whoring,&#8221; Obasanjo said. &#8220;Nice place in Makurdi where&#8211;&#8221;
&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t call it _nice_,&#8221; Tamunosaki said. &#8220;You mean cheap.&#8221;
&#8220;No, not that place we went with Akpu-nku. There&#8217;s one uptown.&#8221; Obasanjo shrugged. &#8220;Might as well spend all my money, right?&#8221; He said it like a joke, but nobody laughed.
Yaradua knocked her glass back, and Balogun focused on twirling her knife. We headed planetside at 0800 tomorrow, and MilComm gave slim odds that we&#8217;d make it back. The silence stretched, Obasanjo looking expectantly around for someone to agree with him.
Yaradua clanged her empty glass down on the table. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t fucking ask you, Obasanjo. I asked Amaechi.&#8221;
&#8220;She&#8217;d probably go to the ballet,&#8221; he said with a snort.
The corners of my glass dug into my palms; I wondered if I could squeeze it hard enough for it to shatter. The two missing fingers on my left hand itched. I twitched the stub of my middle finger, and contemplated slamming my glass into Obasanjo&#8217;s forehead. If it weren&#8217;t for those [...]</itunes:summary>

Marley and Cratchit
by David Steffen
STAVE 1: THE MARVELOUS MACHINE
In those days Jacob Marley was full of life and vigor. His smile shone so that anyone who saw him soon smiled widely in return. A moment in his presence would make one&#8217;s worst burdens seem lighter. His optimism and generosity brought out the best in others, catching easily as a torch in dry straw.
Those were happy, hopeful times. Ebenezer Scrooge, the pinch-faced and greedy miser, would not weigh on his mind until many years later. In those later years the two men&#8217;s appearances matched as twins, and their customers would often confuse one for the other. But in every other manner they were as different as two men could be. I will speak further of Scrooge, but not yet, for this is not his tale. In these days long gone, Jacob Marley was a portly man, neatly dressed and neatly groomed, with hair black as pitch and never a whisker on his face. Marley entered the shop on that momentous day in the manner with which he was accustomed, swinging the door wide and exclaiming &#8220;Hallo!&#8221; to his business partner in a sonorous voice that any Shakespearian actor would envy. His jowls swung with the force of his entry, and wobbled like a custard for quite some time after. His clothes were not of the finest material, but were fine enough for a man of his young age, a sign of the moderate inheritance left him by his father the year prior. The front office held two desks, one tidy and one covered with heaps of paper and mechanisms.
Behind the cluttered desk Bob Cratchit looked up with a quiet smile. Where Marley was expansive and memorable, Cratchit was small and quiet and utterly forgettable. He was a pleasant man, so pleasant that I have only ever known one man to ever speak crossly of him: Scrooge, that nasty old miser who spoke crossly of everyone, regardless of cause. Look! He has intruded again upon our story where he is not wanted. I will speak of him no more until his presence enters upon the story.
Although Cratchit was a pleasant man, and earnest, he was easily forgotten, apt to leave no lasting impression on the memory. In fact, even I can no longer bring his features clearly to my mind. All I can
say of his appearance is that he was exceedingly ordinary in every respect, and he was of an age with his partner, both old enough to have earned their own reputation, but young enough to hold wild and optimistic musings of their future. Cratchit&#8217;s forgettable appearance suited him well enough, because people made him unaccountably nervous, and he found even idle conversation to be terribly taxing. If no one remembered him, then no one would seek him out and he would be left to his alchemy. In those days he did little else, his efforts supported by Marley&#8217;s coffers in the hopes of finding something to build a business on.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve finished it,&#8221; Cratchit. &#8220;I&#8217;ve finished my great work, the one which will make us our fortune.&#8221;
&#8220;Oh! Why didn&#8217;t you say so!&#8221; Marley asked, with a slap to Cratchit&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;To your feet, Bob. Jump with joy, shout from the rooftops.&#8221;
&#8220;I am quite excited,&#8221; Cratchit admitted, still smiling his quiet little smile. &#8220;Would you like to see it work?&#8221;
&#8220;Of course, of course.&#8221;
Cratchit led the way to the workroom in the back where Marley hadn&#8217;t ventured for months, not wanting to disturb the alchemical processes. The workroom was but a larger manifestation of the cluttered desk at the front, packed from wall to wall with papers and metalwork, beakers and boilers. Cratchit&#8217;s newest and greatest work stood in the center of the room, looking like a shrine within its circle of clear space. It was an upright wooden hoop a pace in diameter, with strang[...]</itunes:summary>

The half-buried thing hadn’t moved once, but I didn’t have to include that in the story when I got back to base. The great, gray mass of it rose at least ten feet out of the red earth, tucked close to the sheer wall of the plateau. That part I’d tell. If there had been anything like a head, I would have shot it, but it just looked like a giant, lumpy football, oozing a viscous yellowy liquid here and there.
The non-military personnel tried to remember their instructions, looking away from the muzzle of my rifle as the metallic squeal of the charging weapon warned of an impending discharge. The moment the noise ended, a pencil-thin beam of white light leapt from the gun and bored another sizzling hole into the motionless mound of wrinkled gray flesh. There was a sound like someone cooking giant bacon in a giant skillet.
I just can’t describe how much I love photon rifles. They’re big, noisy, ugly, unapologetic things that leave your hands shaking and the entire area smelling like ozone. They were shit on stealth missions but, then, so am I—that’s just one of the many reasons I got this gig as the Army equivalent of a galactic janitor.
Sergeant Wroblewski and I made eye contact as I turned to address the science team, and I noted the silent “high-five” look on his face.
“Well?” I said smoothly to Science Officer Neely. “Doesn’t get much deader than that.” I tried to look nonchalant.
Neely raised some sort of high-tech monocular to his eye and peered at the creature.
“No, I’m afraid not,” he said, shaking his head.
“What? That’s the fourth direct hit. What the hell is that goo bubbling out of it, if it isn’t dead?”
“Well, I’m not certain captain, but that ‘goo’ was bubbling out of it when we arrived.”
“Christ, the thing has four holes through it that weren’t there when we got here. I may not know much, but I know dead. And that thing is dead.”
“Captain, we all have the same orders. We can’t establish a construction base, let alone a settlement, until we clear the indigenous flora and fauna from this sector. It is fortuitous that, on this occasion, there is only a single life form here. But, I’m telling you, that organism’s life signs have not changed since we arrived.”
“Look,” I said slowly, “I put holes in things. That’s how we kill things. It’s a tried and true method that has worked for humanity many, many times. What do you suggest I do next?”
“That isn’t really my area of expertise, but explosives come to mind.”
“I would agree with you, if I had brought any.” (Truthfully, I didn’t have the clearance to handle explosives.) “I was told ‘one, big sedentary critter.’ Didn’t think I needed to bring detonators.”
“Well, then might I suggest. . .”
Neely’s lips kept moving, but it suddenly seemed like the sounds just plain weren’t reaching my ears. There was a strange subtle pressure building behind my eyes, and a low rumbling steadily becoming louder.
Neely’s mouth just kept flapping and I could tell that neither he, nor the rest of the group, felt anything out of the ordinary. Then, without warning, everything just stopped. I don’t mean the group stood still, I mean stopped—like I had just found myself in the middle of a photograph. The pressure in my head slacked to a general, sustained discomfort. It sorta felt like being in deep water, except that I could breathe and move just fine. I glanced up at a swirling cloud of whitish vapor that was now simply frozen motionless against the pinkish backdrop of the sky.
“Uh. . .” I said thoughtfully to nobody in particular. “That’s probably not good.”
“What, you mean you can’t do that?” Asked a voice behind me.
I whirled around, bracing the stock of my rifle against my shoulder as I moved.
“Seriously? That’s your plan? You’re really gonna shoot me with that thing[...]</itunes:summary>

Chandra&#8217;s Game
by Samantha Henderson
Joey Straphos, Papa Joe, told me once that Chandra’s Game is a bitch of a city, fickle but generous when the mood strikes her.  But Papa Joe was a romantic.
Chandra’s Game roots in the side of a barren asteroid moon like a tick.  Over the years we’ve burrowed deeper into rock and ice until poor Chandra is mostly Game.  We loop the twin wormholes, Gehenna and Tartarus, roundabout in a figure eight, ready to catch the freighters as they escape from hell’s dark maw.  We strip them of goods and drink their heat, load them up and send them into another hell.  It&#8217;s a profitable game, Chandra’s.
My mother smuggled me into Chandra’s Game without patronage and compounded her error by dying without permission; I was Terra-born unless she was lying, which was likely enough.  I joined the other unregistereds down in the Warrens: ferals that lived off the Mayor’s Dole and by odd-jobs when that wasn’t enough.  Papa Joe fed us, and sometimes the tunnels were glorious with the smell of meat, and if you were smart or hungry enough you didn&#8217;t ask from what.  Where there&#8217;s humanity there are rats, and Joey wasn&#8217;t a rich man, not then.  But food is food, and he’d bunk you if he could, and if all he asked in return for the latest Warren scuttlebutt or a few sticks of ephedrine off a freighter’s load, what of it?  Saints are few and far between in Chandra’s Game.
Papa Joe always liked me: I stayed a bit feral, tomboy—nothing like his daughters.  He had them late in life, when he got rich, and they were elegant, lux level creatures.  Not like Joey, not like Mrs. Joe.  She was quiet and kind, and if she knew a nano of Joey’s business she never let on.  When Gregor Straphos died I died a little.  But Mrs. Joe died all the way.
I’d been legit for years.  I still snooped, but in an upright way.  Helped the Company Men find bits of their loads that went astray between Gehenna and Tartarus, passed on Warren talk to the prefects when some smart kid got out of hand, pointed the way to speedwell labs that weren’t circumspect about what went into their product.  Nothing that would disturb the delicate balance between the business of the Family, the Companies and the Mayor. 
Joey had his own snoops, payroll loyal.  So when a grubby-faced feral knocked up my crib, saying Joey wanted a word, I had to wonder why.  I hadn&#8217;t seen him in years.  Not since Gregor was cremated.
Papa Joe never lived on the lux levels: too far away from his daily business.  His crib was in that middle span twixt Warren and lux, where the heavy, humid smell of humans going about their dailies pervaded.  Inset into the dull rough rock of Chandra’s tunnels, his entry was like mine but for the over-muscled toughs that bracketed it, giving me a once-over glare but no guff.  Past his door it was different.
Good living thickened him.  He gripped me by the shoulders, hard, and shook me, his heavy gold rings bruising my shoulders.
“It&#8217;s been a long time, Sarabet,” he rumbled.  “Too long.”
He pushed me into an overstuffed sofa, and I looked at the crib with a professional eye.  The room was luxurious, almost frivolous.  The walls had been polished smooth, and intricate patterns were visible in the surface that looked so dull in the tunnels.  The furniture, Terran-antique, could’ve kept me living high for years.  A thick Thantopian carpet covered the floor, cut from the surface of a place Joey and me would never see—it was the probably the most precious thing in the place, beautifully marbled in blue and green.  The warmth of it struck up through my thin corridor slippers.
There were ikons of people I didn’t recognize on tabletops and inset into the smooth walls.  Some I did: there was Mrs. Joe, looking mild and maybe sl[...]</itunes:summary>

Health Tips for Traveler
by David W. Goldman
Since the short time from mutual greetings of worlds, many Earther wish to visit the lovely world of the Pooquar peoples. This explainer before so will bring yourselves a voyage most lovely.
Within The Transit
The travel via cross-continuum portal will be novel to many Earther. Hydration is a paramount for not having the small problems of liver, marrow, blood tubes, and self memory. Also good before your trip is to make fat, especially under the skin. The scrawny traveler should begin preparation many week prior.
Portal going is sudden and then done. But many Earther say after that they think the journey is very very very long and never to stop. Thus is Earther brains supposed bad attuned to one or more of the interim journey continuum. For thus, non-conscious makes for most lovely travel. Means of non-conscious both pharmacological and percussive are on offer by helpful Pooquar portal agents.
As the Early Days
Because subtle differences in physics regulations from what most Earther are parochially accustomed, the traveler is suggested to acclimate in the &#8220;horizontal&#8221; position until local niceties of unreliant gravity, time-keeping, and atmospheric presence become appreciated. Acclimation such will entertain you for no more than two &#8212; or for some traveler, twenty or thirty &#8212; &#8220;days.&#8221;
While thus occupied with your appreciation of localness, helpful Pooquar hostelry staffpersons will provide you with lovely hydration and fat-making nutritionals. For your best healths, stint not on your consumption.
Touring the Out-Vicinity
While you delight yourselves in the appreciation of very-known scenics as the Flowing Up Falls of Nagbaf, the Lesser Half Dark Big Hole, the Plain of Many Breath Sucks, and other such lovely vicissitudes, some attention to health and safeness are ordered.
Firstmost, if urgent advised by helpful Pooquar tour leader, immediately disobey not! Your very life endurance may happen. This is especially as pertains to stepping away from lovely trails, consuming unadvised nutritionals, perusing explainers offered by exiled dissident non-persons, or providing unsolicited refreshment to local fauna/flora/other life-beings.
Next, maintenance your lovely all-enwrapping tourist jumpsuit and coverall always. The presentation of the skin, even a small only piece of the skin, is discouraged for health. This from the fad of local life-beings to reproduce by injecting seed-forms into passing faunas, later to germinate and partake of the subcutaneous lipids in achieving bigness. Thus is best always your jumpsuit and coverall with integrity. (Small note: In the event of any rash of discolor or tendrils from the skin please notify immediately your helpful Pooquar tour leader for the swift extirpation.)
In finality, avoid districts of elevated temperature and humidity. In these grow the grubs of local life-beings, who may exhibit unsolicited hunger of lovely Earther visitor.
After leaving the out-vicinities, you should place the above-spoken biologic factual concerns far from your self memories.
Of the Urban Jollity
In welcome for subsequent your joyful tours of the out-vicinities, the Pooquar peoples of the citified regions will ply you unsparingly with lovely bring-home curios and appliances and also nutritionals without betterment for taste and skin-fat-making. Enjoy all these with loveliness!
In the cities is no great harm for concern of health. But be full of alert to avoiding speech from irks[...]</itunes:summary>

A Querulous Flute of Bone
by Cat Rambo
Wherever, whenever wealth accumulates enough to create the idle, one finds those who collect things.
Such collections vary. Some catalog every cast off bit of flesh or chitin they shed. Others look outside themselves for art, or titillation, or an oblivion in which they can forget everyday life.
Collections may consist of the most mundane objects: string, or chewed up paper, or broken teacups, for example. Or they can take on outré forms: dioramas made of nihlex bone (considered contraband in certain areas), or squares of cloth exposed to the Smog, prized for the oracular patterns of dirt left deposited on the fabric, or the tiny aluminum snowflakes said to have fallen into the world during an Opening over a century ago.
Aaben was such a collector. S/he was one of the geniod, whose gender varies according to mood, location, and other private considerations, and who are known, in the face of great trauma, to forget who they are and become entirely different personalities, their old selves never to be resumed or spoken of. Some races adulate them for this, while others mock them. Such excesses of reaction have driven the geniod to keep to themselves, not by law, but preference.
Aaben was an oddity in its own preferences, for it was willing to travel, to go farther than most of its race, driven by the desire to augment its collection, choosing to focus only on its quest.
The items it sought, ranging up and down the Tube in expeditions funded by two sets of indulgent grandparents and a much less indulgent set of parents, were things that could be considered metaphors for the world and the state of those in it. In this pursuit, it followed the strictures of the philosopher-king Nackle, who described the emotions that such objects evoked in the beholder in one five hundred page monograph, and the intellectual effect of such exposure in a second, even longer work, followed by a six volume set of explanatory footnotes and addendums.
Aaben had studied at the knee of an ancient human who had himself been instructed by an uncle who had read thoroughly in the works of Nackle. The teaching had impressed it with a gravity and depth of the sort that scores the soul and directs all its movements in later years. Its search was a tribute to Nackle’s ideas, for it looked for the things that Nackle posited existed, which could only be discovered by matching the emotion they evoked with that described in Nackle’s pages, a task that required the laborious memorization of all of the philosopher’s works.
Nackle’s theory, insofar as such a thing can be simplified, was this: Twenty one types of emotion exist in the world. Certain artifacts create emotions in the viewer, emotions unaffected by the viewer’s history or idiosyncrasies of personality, but which are basic to the existence of all intelligent creatures. There are literally hundreds of sub-emotions, ranging from a soul’s regret when it wishes to sing but cannot, to the joy of carrying on one’s ancestral line in the face of tremendous adversity or the anticipatory worry that one might not fully recall an upcoming oracular dream.
The perception of these emotions required deep study and meditation. To find the artifacts that replicated the base emotion, the one from which all the smaller sub-emotions sprang, one must move through a progression of refinement of the senses, created by the search for and exposure to artifacts exemplifying the emotions Nackle described.
Most of Nackle’s followers would object to this simplification. They would point to subtleties of one kind or another, but truth be told, the theory was relatively uncomplicated.

The Care and Feeding of Mammalian Bipeds, v. 2.1
by M. Darusha Wehm
The first day I meet my human herd they are so well-behaved that I wonder if they really need me at all. I arrive at their dwelling, and am greeted by the largest one of their group. I access the manual with which I have been programmed and skip to Section 3: Verbal and Physical Clues for Sexing Humans. I can tell by the shape and outer garments that this human is a male, and I make a note of this data. He brings me into the main area of their living space, and as we move deeper into the dwelling, he asks me to call him Taylor, so immediately I do. He makes a noise deep in his throat, then introduces me to the rest of the herd.
He puts his forelimb around the next largest one, who he introduces as Madison. The Madison bares its teeth at me in a manner that Section 14: Advanced Non-Verbal Communication suggests is a gesture indicating happiness, approval, cheerfulness, or amusement, but which may belie insincerity, boredom or hostility. The Madison says, &#8220;Welcome to the family, Rosie.&#8221;
&#8220;Thank you, Madison,&#8221; I respond, as suggested by the manual in Section 2: Introductions: Getting To Know Your Humans. &#8220;I am looking forward to serving you and your family.&#8221; The manual indicates that human herds designate each individual with a name, and that most will bestow a similar designation on their caregiver. Section 0: A Brief Overview of Current Anthropological Theories states that the predominant view is that humans believe we are a new addition to the herd, and the best thing to do is to go along with this idea so as not to confuse them. The Taylor and the Madison appear to have chosen to refer to me by the name Rosie, and I set my monitoring routine to key on the sound of that word.
&#8220;These here are Agatha and Frederick,&#8221; the Taylor says, pushing two smaller humans toward me. I am unable to tell by looking whether or not they are male or female &#8212; they are about the same height as each other, with shoulder-length glossy fur. Their outer coverings are very similar, shapeless and dark coloured except with colourful designs in the upper section. One of them bares its teeth at me, in a manner similar to the Madison&#8217;s earlier display, but the other looks away. &#8220;Kids,&#8221; the Taylor says, his voice growing deeper, &#8220;say hi to the new robot.&#8221;
&#8220;Hi, Rosie,&#8221; the toothy one says, &#8220;I&#8217;m Frederick, and this is my sister, Aggie.&#8221; The Frederick pulls on the forelimb of the other one, who looks through its fur at me.
&#8220;This is so stupid,&#8221; it says, pulling its arm out of its sibling&#8217;s grip. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have to say hi to the dishwasher or the school bus, why do I have to pretend to be nice to this thing?&#8221;
&#8220;Agatha,&#8221; the Madison says, its voice becoming higher pitched. &#8220;Be civilized.&#8221;
&#8220;We don&#8217;t need a house-bot,&#8221; the Agatha says. &#8220;It&#8217;s so embarrassing.&#8221; It turns away from the rest of the herd, and walks into another part of the dwelling.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll go talk to her,&#8221; the Frederick says, and walks away. Her. The Agatha is female, then.
The Madison turns toward me, its skin colouring a dark pink tone. I make a note to check its temperature later &#8212; it would not do for a member of my herd to become ill. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry about Agatha,&#8221; it says. &#8220;She&#8217;s thirteen. You know how teenagers are.&#8221;
I do not understand what it is I am expected to know about teenagers, but I do know that the correct response to the sounds &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; is &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s okay,&#8221; so that is what I say. I notice the Madison&#8217;s colour return to[...]</itunes:summary>

Passengers
By Robert Silverberg
There are only fragments of me left now. Chunks of memory have broken free and drifted away like calved glaciers. It is always  like that when a Passenger leaves us. We can never be sure of all the things our borrowed bodies did. We have only the lingering traces,  the imprints.
Like sand clinging to an ocean-tossed bottle. Like the throbbings of amputated legs.
I rise. I collect myself. My hair is rumpled; I comb it. My face is creased from too little sleep. There is sourness in my mouth. Has my Passenger been eating dung with my mouth? They do that. They do anything.
It is morning.
A gray, uncertain morning. I stare at it awhile, and then, shuddering, I opaque the window and confront instead the gray, uncertain surface of the inner panel. My room looks untidy. Did I have a woman here? There are ashes in the trays. Searching for butts, I find several with lipstick stains. Yes, a woman was here.
I touched the bedsheets. Still warm with shared warmth. Both  pillows tousled. She has gone, though, and the Passenger is gone, and I am alone.
How long did it last, this time?
I pick up the phone and ring Central. “What is the date?”
The computer’s bland feminine voice replies, “Friday, December fourth, nineteen eighty-seven.”
“The time?”
“Nine fifty-one, Eastern Standard Time.”
“The weather forecast?”
“Predicted temperature range for today thirty to thirty-eight. Current temperature, thirty-one. Wind from the north, sixteen miles an hour. Chances of precipitation slight.”
“What do you recommend for a hangover?”
“Food or medication?”
“Anything you like,” I say.
The computer mulls that one over for a while. Then it decides on both, and activates my kitchen. The spigot yields cold tomato juice. Eggs begin to fry. From the medicine slot comes a purplish liquid. The Central Computer is always so thoughtful. Do the Passengers ever ride it, I wonder? What thrills could that hold for them? Surely it must be more exciting to borrow the million minds of Central than to live awhile in the short-circuited soul of a corroding human being!
December fourth, Central said. Friday. So the Passenger had me for three nights.
I drink the purplish stuff and probe my memories in a gingerly way, as one might probe a festering sore.
I remember Tuesday morning. A bad time at work. None of the charts will come out right. The section manager irritable; he has been taken by Passengers three times in five weeks, and his section is in disarray as a result, and his Christmas bonus is jeopardized. Even though it is customary not to penalize a person for lapses due to Passengers, according to the system, the section manager seems to feel he will be treated unfairly. So he treats us unfairly. We have a hard time. Revise the charts, fiddle with the program, check the fundamentals ten times over. Out they come: the detailed forecasts for price variations of public utility securities, February-April 1988. That afternoon we are to meet and discuss the charts and what they tell us.
I do not remember Tuesday afternoon.
That must have been when the Passenger took me. Perhaps at work; perhaps in the mahogany-paneled boardroom itself, during the conference. Pink concerned faces all about me; I cough, I lurch, I stumble from my seat. They shake their heads sadly. No one reaches for me. No one stops me. It is too dangerous to interfere with one who has a Passenger. The chances are great that a second Passenger lurks nearby in the discorporate state, looking for a mount. So I am avoided. I leave the building.
After that, what?
Sitting in my room on bleak Friday morning, I eat my scrambled eggs and try to reconstruct the three lost nights.
Of course it is impossible. The conscious mind functions during the period of captivity[...]</itunes:summary>

Springtime for Deathtraps
By Marjorie James
The building sat in a small clearing in the jungle, its stone walls
radiating solidity and the midday heat. Giant statues of warrior-gods
crushing skulls beneath their feet flanked the doorway. Xnab looked
from the ornately carved keyhole to his customer and back again.
&#8220;And the key is where, exactly?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;In the treasure chamber,&#8221; the big man said in a small voice. &#8220;We had
just finished putting everything away and, well, it had been a long
day. I think I must have put the key down on the altar or something.
The problem is, the place locks automatically, and our entire fortune
is in there. We had a few locksmiths out to work on it, but they
didn&#8217;t get very far.&#8221;
Xnab nodded. He had already noticed the blood spatter around the keyhole.
&#8220;So that&#8217;s why we called you. Everyone said that if anybody could get
in there, it would be you.&#8221;
Xnab accepted that, not as a compliment, but a statement of fact. He
was a specialist the design and construction of booby traps, deadfalls
and other, largely fatal, security options. He was a small man, thin
and wiry, his shaved head still smooth and unwrinkled despite years of
working in the sun. Despite making a very good living, he wore a plain
tunic and no adornments at all. In his business, he considered it a
bad idea to have anything extra hanging around, and he was very good
at his business. In fact, anyone who knew anything considered Xnab the
best death trap designer alive.
Which typically would have been reason enough to turn down a job like
this, but in this case it was actually why he was there.
&#8220;How long have you owned the temple?&#8221; he asked the man, who had
introduced himself as Tuak.
&#8220;Just a couple of months, actually,&#8221; Tuak admitted. &#8220;It&#8217;s not really a
temple. I think the statues of the gods are just there for show. The
family who used to have it used it to store their treasures and they
spared no expense on the security.&#8221; He sighed heavily and stared up at
the tiers of stone vanishing into the jungle. &#8220;It seemed like a good
idea when we bought it.&#8221;
Xnab&#8217;s apprentice, Qualenizmunetil (Qual to anyone who couldn&#8217;t be
bothered) came back from where he had been examining the walls of the
entrance and joined them.
&#8220;They&#8217;re perfectly smooth, sir,&#8221; the boy said with something close to
awe. &#8220;I can&#8217;t even find a tool mark.&#8221;
&#8220;And you won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Tuak, pride of ownership momentarily overcoming
his embarrassment. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t another building like this anywhere in
the eighteen kingdoms.&#8221;
&#8220;No,&#8221; Xnab said. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t.&#8221;
He spent a moment staring down the apparently open and inviting
corridor, then turned back to his customer.
&#8220;You mentioned the previous owners. How did you come to own this place?&#8221;
Tuak smirked. &#8220;Well, a treasure house isn&#8217;t much use if you don&#8217;t have
any treasure left to store. You know, all these the aristocrat
families are the same. They go on for generations, saying they&#8217;re the
cousins of the wind gods, making everyone lick the stones in front of
them. Then one day they lose a couple wars and the next thing you know
the last of the line is blowing through the money like he doesn&#8217;t know
what saving is. The storehouse was the last thing he had to sell.&#8221;
None of this was of much interest to Xnab, so he listened with half an
ear as the man turned his attention to Qual, his earlier embarrassment
apparently forgotten.
&#8220;I say it&#8217;s about time,&#8221; Tuak went on. [...]</itunes:summary>

I knew Wing&#8217;s idea was stupid.  But we were all so goddamn sick of quarantine that it sounded great anyway.
&#8220;Chinese New Year on Halloween night, huh?&#8221; I asked him.  We sat on his broken futon and some folding chairs, passing a bottle of Captain Jack among the eight of us.  Someone leaned on a car horn outside our apartment.  When they didn&#8217;t stop, my buddy Matt leaned out the window and swore at them in Mandarin.  Matt was loud&#8211;even a flu mask didn&#8217;t muffle his bellowing.  I swear, even though every restaurant in San Francisco Chinatown had been closed since February, tourists still cruised the streets.  Even a pandemic couldn&#8217;t stop them completely.
&#8220;Dude.  Someone will shoot us,&#8221; said the guy from 4B, who I think was named Jimmy Li.  We all lived in the same nasty building on Grant Street above a dim sum place owned by our slumlord.  I knew Matt, who&#8217;d invited me, and my little brother Jian of course.  Wing lived here in 3A.  I&#8217;d just met the Chao twins who had different haircuts, and then Jimmy and some dude Xiang.  At twenty-three, I was pretty sure I was the oldest guy here.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the point,&#8221; said Wing heavily, as if he&#8217;d explained this a hundred times when he actually hadn&#8217;t.  &#8220;We&#8217;ll be in costume.  First off, all the riots will be in the Mission, so that&#8217;s where the cops will be.  Second, no one&#8217;s going to shoot a New Year&#8217;s lion.  Dude.  It&#8217;s Chinatown.  All the old cops here are superstitious.  Can you imagine how much bad luck it would bring?  Even if some cop got itchy on the trigger, he&#8217;ll think about it long enough for us to run away.&#8221;
&#8220;No one&#8217;s shooting anyone,&#8221; said Matt.  &#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, this isn&#8217;t Montana.&#8221;  He pushed his mask aside, swigged the Jack, and passed it to Jian.  I snagged the bottle out of his hands.  No freaking way would I let my little brother drink from that bottle.  Who knew where the other guys had been?  They might pull off their masks and drink, but damned if I let my little brother do it.  Jian glared at me, but didn&#8217;t fight back.
I passed the bottle to Wing.  &#8220;They might shoot if things get out of hand,&#8221; I said.  &#8220;It&#8217;s Halloween.  Everyone&#8217;s twitchy.  But you&#8217;re right, I heard a bunch of people are gonna swarm the Mission.  That&#8217;s where the cops will go.&#8221;
Wing took another swig.  He wasn&#8217;t wearing a mask; that was only Matt and Jian and me.  Wing went to the kitchen and reappeared with a stack of well-used disposable cups and washed straws.  He swiped an unopened bottle of Jose Cuervo off a shelf and handed it to me.
I thanked him and poured myself way too much tequila.  I knew I wasn&#8217;t supposed to peel the mask off, even for a minute, but it&#8217;d been a bad week.  My parents were getting evicted and Jian&#8217;s antivirals were out of stock everywhere.  Pissed me off&#8211;HIV drugs did crap against the flu, but people were desperate and they got prescriptions from quacks.  So my little brother might develop full-blown AIDS thanks to those selfish jackholes.
I slid my mask aside and sucked furiously on the straw.  The Cuervo burned my throat as it went down.  Screw it all.  I felt so goddamn helpless.  More than anything I wanted to do something to make things better, but what could I do?  I couldn&#8217;t cure the flu or save anyone&#8217;s life.  All I could do was avoid getting sick.  I mean, I&#8217;d thought about helping at the hospital or something, but I had to protect my brother.
&#8220;Bo,&#8221; said Jian, leaning over, &#8220;come on, gimme some of that.  Please?&#8221;
