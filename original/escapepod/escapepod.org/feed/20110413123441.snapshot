A Taste of Time
by Abby Goldsmith

1.

On the night she turned twenty-nine, Jane sat on her narrow bed, watching TV and drinking alone.  She'd gone through a bottle of wine and was mostly through a second bottle.  Tomorrow morning would be painful.

Or she could stop worrying about tomorrow.  The ibuprofen in her cabinet kept popping into her mind.  Jane wasn't sure if all those pills chased by alcohol would be enough to end her life, but the idea of looking up how to commit suicide online seemed just too pathetic.

The front door of her tiny apartment creaked open.

Jane leaned forward, peering through her bedroom doorway.  A black wine bottle stood on the floor, with a placard dangling from its silver ribbon.

Her gaze immediately went to the deadbolt.  It was in place, as she'd left it.

Jane shut the TV off and listened for noises from the hallway.  All she heard were the sounds of Boston traffic outside.  Several weeks ago, after she'd come home to find her boyfriend screwing a fat chick on her couch, shersquo;d had the locks changed.  No one could have gotten in.

Yet the bottle sat mysteriously on the wooden floor.

At last, Jane crossed her apartment, checking every shadow for an intruder.

She picked up the bottle.  The placard had gilded letters, making it a potentially expensive gift.

Tabula Rasa
Warning: There Is No Return

Jane flipped the placard over twice, but nothing else was written on it.

She listened, alert for any noise.  Mystery had never been much a part of her adult life, and it gave her a strangely excited feeling.  If the warning label meant something like _poison_, it seemed like a more dignified way to go than pills and alcohol.

Her reflection on the black surface of the bottle was disturbingly clear.  There she was: Plain Jane, a frumpy woman with a double-chin and acne scars.

She unscrewed the cap and popped the foil underneath.  A stringent smell wafted up, making her wrinkle her nose and salivate at the same time.

"Happy birthday, Jane," she told herself, and swallowed a mouthful.

2.

Jane gagged on the sour taste in her mouth.  She was so dizzy, she'd fallen . . . but she was sitting in an office chair, with no memory whatsoever of leaving her dark and quiet apartment.

Florescent lights beat down on her, and the familiar voices of a call center surrounded her.  None of this was possible.  She was back at her old workplace.  It was a workday, late afternoon, judging by the angle of light.  Ultimata Insurance had laid her off months ago, yet here she was.

A man rapped his knuckles against Jane's desk.  "I gave you the files you needed, right?"  Her old boss, Moore, didn't bother to wait for a reply.  He was always in a hurry.  Jane barely started to nod before he rushed away.

The walls of her cubicle looked exactly the way she remembered.  There was the photograph of herself and mom.  There was the generic Ultimata calendar, flipped to October 2009 . . . Jane double-checked the year. 2009 was a full two years before the company downsized.  If this was October 2009, then she was still employed.

And still dating the jerk, Aaron.

Her fists tightened, and she realized that her hand was clamped around the black wine bottle.  She might lose her job more quickly this time, if they saw that.  She hid it beneath her desk.

"Jane!"

Jane swiveled to face Stephanie, who worked in the cubicle across from hers.  Stephanie was slim with bouncy golden hair, and never deigned to speak to plain Jane.

Stephanie hurried across into Jane's cubicle, giving a sneaky look both ways before crossing.  She beamed at Jane.  "...</itunes:summary>

Welcome to April! mdash;

March was a sad month worldwide, and I, frankly, am looking forward to leaving winter behind. (Yeah, I know March starts spring in the Northern Hemisphere, but the damp and dank weather wersquo;ve been having the US South makes me feel more like winter than January did.)

First, the world was shocked by the disasters in Japan, earthquake, tsunami, and the continuing threat of radiation from their nuclear plant.

Then fantasy lost one of its masters with the death of Diana Wynne Jones. Any fan or writer of fantasy needs to read her Tough Guide to Fantasyland, and, well, any of her other books. Thirdlyhellip;

Well, hell, isnrsquo;t that enough?

Many people find themselves feeling lost and useless when it comes to disasters, especially if theyrsquo;re happening far away. Luckily, some very quick and innovative SFF fans and professionals (including Pseudopodrsquo;s own Alasdair Stuart) got together to create Genre for Japan ( http://genreforjapan.wordpress.com/ ), an auction featuring signed books from authors, collections of books from publishers (like Tor and Angry Robot), and editing or critique services from agents and editors. All proceeds go to the Japan Tsunami Appeal run by the British Red Cross. (They know what theyrsquo;re doing.) Give generously and you can get some awesome prizes.

We hope yoursquo;re enjoying the monthly Soundproof PDFs.

We have had gotten a couple of questions asking why some of our audio stories donrsquo;t get printed on the site or in the Soundproof. The answer is simple: we donrsquo;t have the rights.

We buy the audio and ebook rights to all stories we are able to, but sometimes we are only able to get the audio rights, so those stories are in our audio feed. As we move forward we will do everything we can to get both ebook and audio rights.

Herersquo;s to a better month.

The rsquo;76 Goldwater Dime
By John Medaille

I started in 1962, thatrsquo;s when I became a numismatist. You know what that is? Itrsquo;s the study ofhellip;.well, itrsquo;s not the study of anything. Itrsquo;s coin collecting, is what it is.

I was ten in 1962, and Christmas I got my first coin album. I didnrsquo;t actually get it. My father gave it to my brother. It was, you know, yoursquo;ve seen them, a sturdy cardboard folder with slots punched out that you put the coins in. Behind the slots, the empties, it had a backing of blue felt, I remember that. My dad gave it to my brother, I guess maybe thinking it would straighten him out. But coins, you know, they donrsquo;t really have that power. He wasnrsquo;t interested. He gave it to me. Me, I was interested.

The album was for Lincoln pennies, 1909 to 1959. I had five cents in the world then and each of the five fit in the slot. It only took me five more days to get the other forty-five. I would do anything for those pennies and slot it in its slot. Anything, anything. When I got my last penny, wow. It was a 1943 steel mint penny, a lsquo;steelie.rsquo; They had to use steel instead of copper that year cause they needed the copper for all the bombs. I was so proud.

From then on it was just coins for me. My life was coins. I was hooked. They had their hooks in me, boy.

When I was just seventeen I moved by myself down to Washington, DC, cause I got a job there in a coin shop. That was my education. I lived in a one room dungeon in a crumby neighborhood, I loved coins that much.

You know, and I do alright. I made my living. I own my own house. I donrsquo;t live in debt like everybody else does. Thatrsquo;s what coins did for me. Coins and specie and spec. I donrsquo;t care for paper money, it holds nothing for me.

Me, Irsquo;m a specialist. I know generalists, I do business with them, I have to. And speculators, sure. You do what you need to do to survive in the world. But me, Irsquo;m a specialist and my friends are specialists. Irsquo;ll give an example, I have a friend, he died. But before he died, his specialty was pay toilet tokens. I mean, have you ever seen a pay toilet? In your life? I saw some once in Europe but I donrsquo;t even know if they have them there anymore. Anyway, this friend of mine, he spends his life collecting these tokens, these coins, for pay toilets, from around the world and every age. He finds the obscurest pay toilet tokens there are and theyrsquo;re his. And then he dies alone in his apartment with these thousands of toilet tokens around him. I mean, thatrsquo;s the way to go. I mean that. To have these objects of joy around you. To you and me, they are not objects of joy, but to him they are. You know, not everybody gets to have that, itrsquo;s not something that everyone receives. To have such pleasure from these things, these old things. But he does and I do because, see, wersquo;re specialists. Not everybody understands that.

Other people I know, you know, have their special collections. Any thing you can think of, any given thing and therersquo;s some guy like me out there obsessed with it. I know people, you meet a lot of interesting people in this business, whose specialties are Depression era wooden nickels or peep show tokens, or misprint coins, error coins, or brockage, thatrsquo;s coins with mirror image stamps on both sides, or obverses or lsquo;Godless Dollars.rsquo; You ever heard of lsquo;Godless Dollars?rsquo; Those are dollar coins where the ldquo;In God we trustrdquo; part got left off. Now, you see, I respect that. Those are people with specialties. They are connoisseurs, like me. Not any old crap will do.

	Next week... Coin collecting SF. I'm serious.

Jaiden's Weaver
by Mary Robinette Kowal

I was never one of those girls who fell in love with horses. For one thing, on our part of New Oregon they were largely impractical animals. Most of the countryside consisted of forests attached to sheer hills and you wanted to ride something with a little more clinging ability. So from the time I was, well, from the time I can remember I wanted a teddy bear spider more than I wanted to breathe.

The problem is that teddy bear spiders were not cheap, especially not for a pioneer family trying to make a go of it.

Mom and Dad had moved us out of Landington in the first wave of expansion, to take advantage of the homesteading act. Our new place was way out on the eastern side of the Olson mountains where Dad had found this natural level patch about halfway up a forested ridge, so we got sunshine all year round, except for the weeks in spring and autumn when the shadow of our planet's rings passed over us. Our simple extruded concrete house had nothing going for it except a view of the valley, which faced due south to where the rings were like a giant arch in the sky. Even as a twelve-year-old, angry at being taken away from our livewalls in town to this dead structure, I fell in love with the wild beauty of the trees clinging to the sheer faces of the valley walls.

The only thing that would have made it better was a teddy bear spider so I could go exploring on my own. I felt trapped by the walls of the house and the valley. I had this dream that, if I had a spider, that I'd be able to sell its weavings for enough to install livewalls in my room. That's not as crazy as it sounds; teddy-bear spider weavings are collected all over the colonies and sell for insane amounts of money.

I had a search setup so anytime there was news of a teddy bear spider or a new tube surfaced, I'd be right there, watching those adorable long-legged beasts. I loved their plump furry faces and wanted to run my fingers through their silky russet fur.

I wonder what goes through a survey team's mind when they name things. I mean a teddy bear spider isn't a bear and it isn't a spider, but it looks like both those things. On the other hand, a fartycat looks nothing like a cat. They do stink, though.

Not quite a year after we'd moved, one of my city friends had forwarded an ad from a local board which set my heart to racing.

Teddy bear spider eggs: 75NOD shipped direct.

Read More...

See, I'd been looking at adult or adolescent teddies which cost more than my folks had set aside for me to go to university. It hadn't even occurred to me that I could raise one up myself. My mindless yearning changed into purpose.

I slapped that ad onto a piece of epaper and ran into the kitchen. "Dad! Mom! Look at this."

Dad glanced up from the eggs he was cracking into a bowl and pursed his lips the way he always did right before saying _no._ "Jaiden, that's a lot of money."

I waved the ad again as if it were a token to get me on a ride at the fair. "We'd make back the money when the teddy started to weave. Please? I've seen their weavings in stores for hundreds of NOD."
Mom ganged up on me. "That's how much the store sells a weaving for, it's not how much they pay for them. Even if it were, you're not just talking the cost of the eggs. It's the cost of feeding it, housing it, vet bills..."

I knew better than to keep arguing. Sometimes if I waited and tried again later, I could get them to change their minds. Still holding the ad, I went outside and plopped on the log bench Dad had made for the front of the house. The broad silver band of the ring spanned the sky, blocked by only a few clouds.</itunes:summary>

On a Clear Day You can See All the Way to Conspiracy
by Desmond Warzel

You're listening to the Mike Colavito Show on Cleveland's home for straight talk, WCUY 1200. The opinions expressed on this program do not reflect those of WCUY, its management, or its sponsors.

Fair warning; I'm in a mood today, folks.

We've got a mayor whose only talent seems to be showing up at luncheons and waving at the cameras.

Eighty bucks I had to pay yesterday for not wearing my seatbelt. Show me the seatbelts on a school bus.

I saw a Cleveland athlete on national TV last night wearing a Yankees cap.

And every day I get at least a dozen calls from schmucks who think that people like me are the problem in this city.

Tell me America's not falling apart.

[pause]

And some of you people--including our programming director, by the way--seem to think I'm running my mouth too much and not taking enough phone calls. I've only been number one in radio in this city for ten straight years; what would I know?

You want calls? You got 'em. Steven in Mayfield Heights, you're on the air.

"Hey, what's up, Mike?"

The rent. Art in Seven Hills, you're on WCUY.

"How you doing, Mike. Just wondering if you caught that ball game last night?"

No. Andrea in Rocky River, go ahead.

"Hi, Mike, first-time caller."

Well, call back tomorrow and you'll be a second-time caller. Carol in Cleveland, what's on your mind?

"Mike, what do you think of waterboarding?"

My wife and I waterboard all the time, and it's improved our sex life dramatically. Chuck in Parma, you're on the air.

"Hey, Mike, I heard your show yesterday, and I was just wondering, if you know so much about football, why you don't take over as head coach of the Browns?"

I wouldn't want to take the pay cut. Mina in Lakewood, you're on the air.

"Does your wife think that waterboarding crack was funny?"

Play your cards right some night and you could find out for yourself, Mina. Tommy in Beachwood, you're on WCUY.

"Hi, Mike, just wondering who you think the Indians should try and trade for next year."

Your mother. Jane in Euclid, go ahead.

[pause]

Read More...


Looks like we lost Jane in Euclid. Must have answered her question already. That's all right; we got in seven callers in under a minute. Everyone happy now? Hey, Jake, I have to take a breather; do the traffic.

What?

Oh, yeah. This traffic is brought to you by West Side Hardware.

Thanks, Mike. Not much happening right now; 480, 271, and 77 are all clear, but traffic on the Shoreway is backed up in both directions, so our listeners might want to allow a few extra minutes if they're headed that way. For West Side Hardware, this has been your WCUY traffic report on Cleveland's home for straight talk.

Hey, Jake, don't go yet. You still there? I gotta take the Shoreway home after the show. Any idea what the holdup is?

Can't say, Mike; no accidents, just a general slowdown all along the lakeshore.

Wonderful.

And people wonder why I'm always giving the mayor grief. Straightest stretch of highway in America, and traffic still won't move. Somebody on the Shoreway, call in and tell me what the hell's going on over there. Franklin in Cleveland, you're on the air.

"What's up, Mike? You gonna let me talk?"

Don't worry, it's all out of my system. The floor's yours.

"Well, you're entitled to your opinion about the mayor, but come on, man, how you gonna blame him for slow traffic?"

The traffic's just a symptom. I'm talking about neglect. Name me one thing the mayor's accomplished since he took office.

"Well--"

You can't, Franklin, beca</itunes:summary>

Grandfather Paradox
by Katherine Mankiller

JUNE 23, 1994

Ann stuffed her blood-spattered clothes into the next door apartment complex's dumpster.  He wasn't dead, but it was harder to get a knife through someone's chest than she'd expected.  Maybe he'd bleed to death before someone found him.  She didn't care either way.  She was a juvenile, so it wasn't like she was going to fry.

She walked.  The YMCA was open.  She locked herself in the men's room, curled up on the floor, and fell asleep.

The next morning, she stopped at an IHOP and told a grey-haired waitress, "I don't have any money, but can I have a cup of coffee?" The waitress must have felt sorry for her:  she bought her breakfast. Afterwards, she went to Safeway and hid a steak and a bottle of beer under her coat and walked out.  And kept walking.  Someone had a barbecue grill in their back yard.  She took it, and the charcoal, too.

What she could really go for now was some mushrooms.  She should swipe some Kool-Aid and find a cow pasture.  Or maybe she could rob a veterinary clinic.  Anything to get the thought of him touching her out of her head, and that beer wasn't going to cut it.

Steak and beer.  Almost luxurious.

The sign read "Open House."  Yes, that sounded about perfect.  She spent the night there, on the carpet smelling faintly of shampoo.

It had happened to him, too.  What her father had done to her, his father had done to him.  Which, in her opinion, just made it worse. He knew what it was like.

When the police arrived and told her she was under arrest for murder, she couldn't stop laughing.

JANUARY 4, 2014

The crane lifted the sealed concrete container out of the hole in the ground.  Ann lay down in the snow next to the hole and reached inside.  "My arms are too short," she said.

Martin lay down next to her.

"Excuse me?" Dr. Chandler, the president of the university, said.

"I'm sorry," Martin said.  "I thought my department chair had spoken to you.  Martin Robbins, physics.  My head programmer, Ann O'Connell. Please, continue."

Dr. Chandler gave them a dirty look, then walked over to the microphone.  "This time capsule was sealed in 1914.  The items inside represent what they wanted us to know about the past.  I'm sure our history department is hoping I'll cut the speech short and let them get at it..."

There was a chuckle from the crowd.

"Got it," Martin said.  He pulled out a grimy Tyvek envelope, and opened it.  Inside, there was a penny dated 2013.  Martin smiled at her.  "Looks like our own time capsule arrived intact."

"How are you feeling today, Ann?"  Dr. Katz asked.  Her glasses were perched precariously on her nose, and her bun was in danger of falling down.

Screw her.  "Is my hour up yet?"

"No."

Fine.  Be that way.

"How are things going with Martin?"

"I stopped dating Martin."

"Why?"

"Because he wanted to sleep with me.  It was awful.  Ugh."

Dr. Katz was giving Ann that psychiatrist look.  Well, Ann had felt like she had to.  Saying no would be rude.  Well, not rude, but... Anyway, no more Martin.  She'd had her phone number changed, and if he came around again?  Restraining order.  Work the system, or the system works you.

"How does that affect your job?" Dr. Katz asked.

"I have vacation time," Ann said.  "I took it."

Yoursquo;re Almost Here
by Melinda Thielbar
 
ldquo;Can I share your table?rdquo;

You look up to see your dream girl. Red hair, cream-colored skin, face just a little round, breasts just a little small. Not movie-star beautiful, not perfect just--nice. She smiles, and her cheeks dimple, and yoursquo;re in love. You gesture to the empty chair across from you with a grin of your own.

ldquo;Be my guest,rdquo; you say.

ldquo;Thanks.rdquo; She takes the chair and sets her coffee cup down. You close the notebook in front of you and open your mouth to say somethingmdash;anythingmdash;to impress this girl.
 
Without looking at you, she turns in her chair, pulls a phone out of her pocket and bends over it. You watch her face in profile as she slips a pair of earbuds into her ears. Your mouth is still open, so you close it and look away. Thatrsquo;s when you see that every table is occupied. Men in suits, women in suits, a few people your age in khakis or jeans. Theyrsquo;re all looking down at their phones, laptops, or handheld game consoles. Sunlight streams in through the floor-to-ceiling windows, and you watch people passing by on the street for a minute. Theyrsquo;re all looking straight ahead, faces set the way they have to be in a city this size. When itrsquo;s this crowded, the only privacy you can give a stranger is not to notice them. That idea interests you, and so you open your notebook to jot it down at the bottom of the second-to-last page. As yoursquo;re writing, a chair scrapes behind you, and a guy in a navy three-piece moves past. He flips his phone open and then closed again, checking the time, and hurries out.
 
The girl across from you moves almost as fast as he does. ldquo;Thanks,rdquo; she says and flashes that amazing smile again before she grabs her drink and hops to the newly-open table. You write FUCK across the top of the second-to-last page of your notebook, tuck it into your pocket, and go get another coffee.

The barristomatic (you call it this; no one else does), takes your thumbprint and opens a menu with your recent drink selections. Theyrsquo;re supposed to be sorted so the one you drink most is at the top. For you, it might as well be random. You do something different every time. This onersquo;s a half-pump vanilla, half-pump strawberry, soy milk latte with a lousy espresso bean that still costs more than all the other ingredients put together because itrsquo;s fair-trade and organic. You once enumerated every combination, ranked them from most to least expensive an...</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Quick note: Sorry it's late folks, minor illness-related delays.

The ePub version can be foundnbsp;here.

To our readersmdash;

Irsquo;ve always been of two minds about that proverb (well, curse) that has been attributed to the ancient Chi- nese of ldquo;May you live in interesting times.rdquo;

Because letrsquo;s face it, boring times are getting further apart and fewer. The era of the noble farmer living a quiet life on the plains is long dead in much of the developed world, and while we always dream of re- turning home to a quiet Ithaca, I think a lot of us prefer the torrents of the seas and not knowing what the next isle will bring.

Which is bit of a long way of saying that it was a bit of a crazy month last month, wasnrsquo;t it?

Thousands of much better words than these have been etched in the cyber on the wave of popular revolu- tions in North Africa and the Middle East, so Irsquo;m going talk about the impending end of the Space Shuttle program.

Space shuttles were always a bit of science fiction that existed in the real world for those of us who grew up after the space race. They were the oddly shaped white space ships in the toy box with the X and Y- Wings and variants of the Enterprise.

They mixed the aspiration of escape from the bonds of gravity with the weight of tragedy that such aspira- tion can lead to. They were something between a pickup truck and the first real wave of space colonizers. Not that the two are mutually exclusive

The third to last shuttle mission is skimming the stratosphere as I write this, and the last one is due to launch in June. And then the US civilian space program will be reliant on private sector for space vehicles until at least 2015. Which, in a way, is progress.

But progress that doesnrsquo;t quite sit right. You want commercial haulers out there making space civilized, useful, and cheap enough that you might be able to hop out there for less than a decadersquo;s salary. But therersquo;s a need for ships of the line, and those come from the public masses.

Last month, Escape Pod brought you four stories, two of which will be republished here. Unfortunately we bought EP279: Conditional Love just before we started asking for ePub rights, as it was just nominated for the Nebula. Escape Pod knows all, but not always at the right time.

But we are bringing you the excellent David D. Levinersquo;s Written On The Wind and the quite interesting Alex Dally MacFarlanersquo;s The Notebook of My Favorite Skin-Trees. Onersquo;s about a bunch of aliens living together, mostly in peace, and the otherrsquo;s about advertising in the near future.

We also did something a little special with the Written On The Wind episode, and you can read about it in the back of this monthrsquo;s Soundproof.
Yours,
mdash;Bill</itunes:summary>

The Notebook of my Favourite Skin-Trees
By Alex Dally MacFarlane

BANANA

The best part of these are the fruits, growing on their fat stem, dangling down the personrsquo;s back or from their arm. I always bow and smile, asking, ldquo;Can I taste one of your fruits? Bananas from a skin-tree are so sweet.rdquo;

So sweet and so small, a single mouthful.

I also enjoy the place where banana tree meets flesh, roots curving over and into the personrsquo;s limb -- pressing my lips there, my tongue -- and the small shade cast by the leaves.

Kim Cuc saw advertisements everywhere she looked in the walking street market, but only on the leaves of the skin-trees: names of shops and cafeacute;s and restaurants spelled out, Thai or English or other languages, in the bright white veins. Aside from the occasional cry from stall owners or vendors -- ldquo;I have the finest grilled bananas in Chiang Mai! Come and taste!rdquo; -- no other form of promotion cluttered the senses.

That had always been the intent of the skin-treesrsquo; engineers and earliest supporters. Kim Cuc smiled often, seeing the remains of once-garishly lit billboards, or walls that several years earlier would have been covered in paper.

No smiles on this night.

She stopped every person with a skin-tree in the walking street market, to ask if theyrsquo;d noticed strange discolourations on their leaves. ldquo;There is a sickness,rdquo; she said, putting urgency into the phrase she now knew in many languages, not just her native Vietnamese and second tongue English, ldquo;and itrsquo;s important to collect samples and data.rdquo; Into one of the notebooks carried under her arm, she noted the age and ethnicity of the person, the age and species of their tree, the company its leaves advertised -- this for those whose trees remained healthy. In a second notebook, with frowning lizards on the spine, she noted the same information for those whose trees were not. There she added information about the duration of the discolourations, their colour and spread. Samples went into a third notebook, with little clips to fasten two pages together, and special paper to protect and preserve the leaves.

The lizard-spined notebook was not as full as the first, yet.

Late in the night, when vendors began packing away their wares, Kim Cuc followed the shoppers returning to their homes. She drank from the large bottle of nutrient-full water she always carried around. The durian tree growing on her left shoulder needed it.

She passed a stall selling Buddha-shaped lanterns, a popular tourist item. Some still glowed, yellowly and redly, and in their light she glanced at her durian. A brown circle, no greater in circumference than a joss stick, lay on the edge of one leaf.

ldquo;No!rdquo; she cried out.

The bright screen of her wrist-computer did not contradict the Buddha lights.

#

BANYAN

The banyanrsquo;s thick roots suggest a secret fluidity, like wax, uncommon to plants: frozen over Pitsamairsquo;s shoulder, beginning where bone used to jut from her thin flesh, sliding down her shoulder blades, curling around her upper arm (carefully trained not to restrict movement), stretching across her collarbone and down her breastbone, down the neat lines of her ribs. They frame her right breast. I always think they will flow when Pitsamai is alone, even though she tells me this isnrsquo;t the case.

The thick leaves advertise Chiang Mai University. Veins curl in the letters in Thai and English, artificially white against dark green. Pitsamai loves her university.

The tangled trunks rise from her shoulder, a...</itunes:summary>

ldquo;Do you know what day it is? What year?rdquo;

ldquo;Itrsquo;s like mid August, 2017?rdquo; her voice squeaked. Jesus, had she really lost her mind?

ldquo;Thatrsquo;s right.rdquo; She smiled. ldquo;Donrsquo;t be scared. I just wanted to be sure.rdquo;

ldquo;What do you mean donrsquo;t be scared?rdquo; she blurted. ldquo;Sure about what? Jesus! How long have I been here? How many times have you seen me before?rdquo;

Jani held up her hand. ldquo;Slow down; itrsquo;s okay...Irsquo;m not an oncologist, but Irsquo;m following your case. The cancer responded well to the treatment. And our research suggests that the side effects are temporary.rdquo;

Stephanie started to protest but then stopped. A terrifying memory flashed through her mind. ldquo;Mom said they might take me to a hospital for the dead.rdquo; She didnrsquo;t know what that meant but the memory was clear. ldquo;She said yoursquo;d keep me here to fool me into thinking Irsquo;m still alive.rdquo;

Jani was holding up both hands now. ldquo;Slow down. The survival rates are scary but theyrsquo;re far bettermdash;rdquo;

ldquo;Yoursquo;re not listening. She said theyrsquo;d take me to a hospital for people whorsquo;ve _already_ died. I have to escape beforemdash;rdquo;

Stephanie started to stand but Jani put a heavy hand on her shoulder and said ldquo;Lullaby.rdquo;

The word opened a bloom of orange light across Stephaniersquo;s vision. A static hiss exploded into her ears, and she felt herself falling. There was a firecracker yellow flash and then...nothing.</itunes:summary>

	Serious apologies - circumstances this week had me recording later than usual.
	Feedback for Episode 271
	Next week... A longer piece by Blake Charlton

The new patient was five or six years old, male, Caucasian, John Doe as  usual.nbsp; Grace checked the vitals his bed sensors were feeding her board  and concluded he was asleep.nbsp; She eased the door of 408 open and stepped in.

The boyrsquo;s head was tilted on his pillow, brown curls cluttering his  forehead.nbsp; Sleep had flushed his cheeks so he looked younger than the  estimate.nbsp; He seemed healthy, with no visible deformities, and if he had  been opted for looks, it had workedmdash;Grace would have described him as  lsquo;cherubicrsquo;.nbsp; He wouldnrsquo;t have been dumped if nothing was wrong, so Grace  found herself stepping softly, unwilling to disturb him and discover  psychological conditions.  

ldquo;Donrsquo;t worry about waking him, he sleeps pretty deep.rdquo;  

Grace started and turned to the other bed.nbsp; ldquo;Hi, Minnie.rdquo;  

The girl grimaced.nbsp; ldquo;I go by my full name now, Dr. Steller.rdquo;nbsp; Grace  brought up her board to refresh her memory, but the girl said, ldquo;Minerva.  nbsp;Had you forgotten theyrsquo;re doubling up rooms?rdquo;  

ldquo;Yep, you caught me.rdquo;  

ldquo;Is the rise in numbers caused by a rise in opting?nbsp; Or is it a rise in  surrenders, or arrests of parents?rdquo;  

ldquo;Lord, Minnmdash;Minerva, I donrsquo;t know.nbsp; Planning to be a reporter when you  grow up?rdquo;  

ldquo;No, a scientist,rdquo; Minerva said and smiled, pleased to be asked.  

ldquo;Why the scalpel-edged questions then?rdquo;  

ldquo;Just curious if my campaign had had any effect,rdquo; Minerva said, nodding  toward the window.nbsp; The billboard across from the Gene-Engineered  Pediatric Inpatient Center flashed a smog warning, then a PSA about eye  strain from computer visors, but Grace remembered when it had borne a  static image:nbsp; Minnie, one year old, a pink sundress exposing the stubs  of her arms and legs.nbsp; _Babies should be born, not made._nbsp; The ad had  stayed up until Minnie was eight, three years after her parents turned  her over to GEPIC, and apparently she had seen it.nbsp; She was twelve now,  with serious eyes and a loose ponytail, dark blonde. </itunes:summary>

Written on the Wind
by David D. Levine

Thuren Nektopk peered down at Luulianni from above his massive desk.  "I suspect you know why I've called you to speak with me in person."  He spoke in his native language, Ptopku Dominant, using the form of address for a subordinate or a child.  It was a constant reminder that the Ptopku had built and largely staffed this station, and was one of the most powerful species in the Consortium.

"Yes, Supervisor," Luulianni replied in the same language, knotting her tentacles.  

"And that would be...?"

"Because of my side project."

"Yes."  Nektopk suddenly released the bar from which he hung, caught himself on another handhold, and with two swift strokes of his arms swung down to where his six slitted eyes were level with Luulianni's.  "Your little side project."  

Luulianni cringed.  "I don't understand why it's so much of a problem."  She straightened and tried to meet his gaze.  "I put in my full quota of time every day."

"Yes, you do, and not one moment more.  But I know you are capable of so much more than that.  Any work you do on this pointless little side project of yours constitutes theft of resources from the Section -- from the whole Project!"

"Theft?" she squeaked.  Angry at herself for the loss of control, she brought her voice down.  "Theft of resources?  But I don't use any data storage space, or any other Section resources!  I write my notes on the backs of old printouts."  She did not mention how much more natural it felt to work on paper.

"You are stealing the most valuable resource of all!"  Nektopk pointed at her with one limber foot.  "Your own time and attention!"

"But it's my time!"

"You have been sent here by your people -- at considerable expense, I might add -- to assist in the Project, to learn the ways of the Consortium, and to demonstrate your species' unique skills."  He leaned closer to her.  His smell was bitter.  "And if I find that your species, as represented by yourself, does not demonstrate any unique skills, your application for Consortium membership could very well be denied."  He swung himself up to the edge of his desk, the better to glare down at her.  "Therefore, your time is not your own.  You owe it to the Section, to the Project, and to your own people to put every bit of available time into your assigned task."

Luulianni hung her head.  "Yes, Supervisor."

"You may return to your work."

"Thank you, Supervisor."

Read More...

#

Luulianni's scales prickled with anger as she made her way back to her workspace.  If she was to demonstrate her unique skills, why did he not listen to her ideas?  And if her time was so valuable, why did Nektopk insist that she come to his office, halfway across the station, rather than using the screen?  

She straightened her shoulders and forced herself to walk down the middle of the corridor.  The Muuli were a burrowing species; her instinct was to cling to the wall, to hide from the harsh, bluish light and the Ptopku swinging from handhold to handhold far above.  Luulianni consoled herself that some day her people would build their own stations in space, with low ceilings and narrow corridors.  They would be dark, and warm, and smell of dirt and of many long-nosed Muuli.

But that day was a long time away.  And if she didn't prove herself here, it might never come.

She knew she was one of the best linguists of her species.  Her work had been invaluable in establishing communication with the many races of the Consortium when they had arrived on her world.  Jun Dal-Nieri, the highly respected head of the Contact Team, had insisted she join the Eight Degrees Projec</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>To our lovely readersmdash;

Itrsquo;s awards season, and yes, we will be talking about it on the blog, and in future podcasts. Even as SF authors all over are posting on their blogs about their 2010 award-eligible work, others are discussing whether this is blatantly trolling for votes.

I can see how a constant barrage of VOTE FOR ME OMG could be irritating and tacky. I certainly find it so when itrsquo;s podcast award season, and one award allows listeners to vote daily, so the constant vote requests tend to be cacophonous. However, Irsquo;m spreading out the awards information for one main reason: donrsquo;t forget the podcasts.

Until recently, people didnrsquo;t even think about nominating a podcast (or any web content) for a Hugo. Heck, it was ground-breaking when webzines started to win. But last year, Catherine Valente self-published a book on her site, and it went on to win the Andre Norton award for best YA novel. Clarkesworld, an online magazine, won the Hugo for best semi-pro zine. And as wersquo;ve mentioned several times (because itrsquo;s still SO FREAKING COOL) Starship Sofa won the Hugo for best fanzine.

I had an uncomfortable panel discussion at last yearrsquo;s NASFiC (North American Science Fiction Convention). We had a panel on podcasting and a very bitter fanzine author showed up (Irsquo;d politely say they shall remain nameless, but honestly I never did catch their name), This person expressed anger that these new methods of reaching fans were getting all their friends to vote for them, as if new fans, or listeners to SF instead of readers, were less worthy to vote for the Hugos.

What gets me is that the new is considered unworthy, not paying its dues, and the fans are similarly unworthy, and their votes just donrsquo;t mean as much. I find that incredibly offensive, as our fans are worldwide, and many have been dedicated to us since we launched five years ago. Others are new to the genre, just trying it out, and loving it, and I sure as hell donrsquo;t want to take a new fan of the genre and tell them they arenrsquo;t worthy.

You, the readers and listeners, donrsquo;t give a crap about this infighting in SF. You want a good story. We try to deliver it to you. As does LightSpeed and Clarkesworld and Starship Sofa and Pseudopod and Podcastle and Drabblecast and Asimovrsquo;s and Analog and F#38;SF and Weird Tales... and so on. You want SF content. We give it to you. And thatrsquo;s the end of story. (Until next week, anyway.)

I had not planned on going on such an impassioned rant. I just want to say that a new fan is worth just as much as an old fan, and a new way to experience shot stories is not a reason to discount it. And whether the Internet-wary veterans like it or not, if yoursquo;re eligible to vote for these awards (WorldCon member for Hugos, SFWA member for Nebulas, and HWA member for Stokers) then your vote counts just as much as theirs does.

I wanted to use this letter to remind you that many, many podcasts are now eligible for the major awards. Starship Sofa broke it open last year, and now we just need to let the listeners know. When you make your Hugo or Nebula or World Fantasy or Stoker ballots, consider Escape Pod, Pseudopod, and Podcastle. Donrsquo;t forget Starship Sofa and Drabblecast. Remember also your favorite podcast novels, novellas, and short stories that were released last year. Irsquo;m not telling you who to vote for, in any of the categories, just wanting to remind you that we mdash; the online content providers mdash; are here are here, delivering weekly content, and if you enjoy it, consider us when you make your nominations.

Yours,

mdash;Mur

Rejiggering the Thingamajig
by Eric James Stone

The teleport terminal had not been built with tyrannosaurus sapiens in mind.

Resisting the urge to knock human-sized chairs about with her tail, Bokeerk squatted on the tile floor, folded the claws of her forelimbs together, and concentrated on her breathing.  Meditation would calm her nerves.  What should have been a two-minute waystop as she switched to a different teleport line had stretched to three hours, and being the only passenger in the terminal creeped her out.

The cheerful voice of the customer service AI roused Bokeerk from her trance.  "It is my pleasure to inform you that the cause of the technical difficulties in the galactic teleport network has been found."

Bokeerk perked up and rose on her hind legs, remembering just in time to duck her head so it wouldn't bang the ceiling lamps.  "Please send me to Krawlak," she said.  It was unlikely that any of her eggs would hatch for another few days yet, but she was anxious to get home.

"It is with the utmost regret that I must tell you that will not be possible at this time," said the AI, with a tone of such abysmal sorrow that Bokeerk's eyes could not help but moisten with sympathetic tears.  "I require assistance in repairing the problem."

Bokeerk lowered herself into a squat again.  "When will help get here?"  She looked at the time display on the digital assistant strapped to her left forelimb.  She had now been stranded for three hours and fifty-two minutes.

"I estimate a spaceship carrying a repair crew could be here within twelve years," said the AI.  Its voice seemed to have lost the customer service aspect.

"Twelve years?"  Bokeerk's voice made the ceiling lamps tremble.

"Without the teleport network, repair crews are limited to slower-than-light travel.  However, I believe we can avoid such a long wait if you will assist me."

"I don't know anything about repairing teleports," said Bokeerk.  "Iillustrate children's books.  I'm on my way home from the Galactic Children's Book Fair."

"You do not need to repair anything," said the AI.  "You merely need to obtain the . . . there's no word for it in English because it is a concept so far beyond the understanding of biological intelligences that there has never been a need for one until now.  Let's call it the thingamajig.  Once you have the thingamajig, you need to do something to it that is completely incomprehensible to your puny mind."

"Hey," said Bokeerk.  She had encountered this kind of prejudice too often.  "My brain may be as small as that of an original tyrannosaurus, but it's the product of genetic tinkering such that my intelligence is at least human standard."

"No slur was intended.  By my standards, any biological intelligence is puny."

"So I just need to do something incomprehensible to the thingamajig, and the teleport network will be fixed?"

"Yes."

"Show me where it is," Bokeerk said.

A holographic projection of a world appeared.  It zoomed in toward a green area on one of the continents until it showed a gray dome in the middle of a jungle.  "This is the teleport station where you are currently located," said the AI.

The image zoomed out until the dome was merely a gray dot.  A crimson line traced a route toward a lone mountain, where it stopped with a large dot.  "You must travel to the top of this extinct volcano, where you will find the thingamajig."

"How far is that?" asked Bokeerk.

"Forty-four miles."

"You don't have a vehicle that would fit me, do you?"

"There are no vehicles of any size."

Bokeerk rose.  "I guess I'd better get started."

"You'll need a gun...</itunes:summary>

On a Blade of Grass
By Tim Pratt

"Interstellar war is about as exciting as playing chess by mail." The guy who said that had been leaning into the bar for so long I thought his chest might fuse with the wood. I drifted over, because he wasn't a regular, and I was bored with all my regulars and their regular bullshit.

"Who plays chess by mail anymore?" I said. "With the 'net and all."

"Nobody. Guys in jail maybe, I don't know. Because it's boring. My point. Inefficient and slow. Just like this war." He tapped his glass meaningfully. He was rumpled and sleep-creased and middle-aged and smelly, but a better class of smelly than my usual crowd -- like working-all-night-sweaty smelly, not sitting-around-all-day smelly. Long enough tending bar and you can tell the difference.

I refilled his glass. He was a pretty good drinker, but the little guys often are. "They say by the time our warships get out there, to their homeworld, the Phages might even be extinct. Like, just from natural processes, long timescales, like that. Or they might've evolved into something new, something that doesn't... you know..."

"Want to eat us?"

Read More...



The guy shook his head. "The aliens don't want to eat us. That was my, what do you call it. Epiphany. They don't want to eat us any more than we want to explore brave new frontiers. All that, eating and exploring, it's just, it's just  incidental."

"I'm pretty sure they want to eat us. Being as, the first time we encountered them, they ate us." I polished a glass, not because the glass was dirty -- it's self-cleaning nanoglass, I run a quality establishment -- but because it's traditional and makes the customers feel like the world isn't rushing past them at a billion miles per second. Well. Metaphorically. Nothing moves that fast, because it's faster than the speed of light, and if things could move faster than the speed of light, this interstellar war would be a lot less boring. At least me and any descendants I was likely to know personally would be dead long before any counterattack hit Earth.

"You know much about parasites?" the guy said.

"Eh. When my wife was pregnant, she made me scoop the shit out of the cat boxes, so she wouldn't get, what do you call it, toxoplasmosis. That's a parasite, right?" I mused. "You know, I'm still the one scooping the cat boxes, and our kid's six years old now. I keep saying we should get nanolitter, but that one cat in Germany got dissolved when the stuff malfunctioned, my wife says she won't risk it."

The guy frowned, like my cat shit stuff had derailed him, but he leaned in deeper and poked the bar with his finger. "Toxoplasmosis. Good example. Yeah, dangerous for women if they get their first exposure when they're pregnant, it can hurt the baby, right, but fact is your wife probably already has it. A third of the people on this planet have the parasite already. Hell, in France, it's close to ninety percent. Not so many here."

"No shit?" I said.

"And, see, the parasite doesn't just make you sick. Toxoplasmosis, a lot of times, you don't get sick at all. But it changes you. Women infected with it, when they have babies, they have more boys than girls. No one knows why. The parasites can change your behavior, too, they make cysts in your brain, alter your personality. They make men more promiscuous and less jealous. They make people less, how do they say it, 'novelty seeking.' Men think women infected with toxoplasmosis are more attractive. Infected women are definitely nicer, anyhow."

"My wife is hot," I said. "I don't think it's because she's got cysts in he</itunes:summary>

Schrouml;dinger's Cat Lady
By Marjorie James

I got out of the car, smoothed my shirt down over my bulletproof vest, and contemplated the cats. They contemplated me right back. I sighed. I hated these jobs.

I opened the tiny gate to the front walk (no fence, just a gate) and made my way to the door. The house was small and tidy, a light blue bungalow with green trim and yellow curtains pulled across the windows, through which the cats were peering. It didnrsquo;t smell, which was a relief. And something of a surprise, considering the heat. It was one of those days when the world seemed to be actively rejecting human habitation, where the smog and the humidity made the air feel like warm mayonnaise. On a day like this, a cat overpopulation should be stinking to high heaven. Maybe this wasnrsquo;t for real, I hoped. It might just be some neighbor with a grudge. Couldnrsquo;t be more than a dozen cats here, max. Maybe this one wasnrsquo;t going to be that bad.

I have never been very good at predicting things.

Read More...



I knocked, and waited. A few minutes later there was the sound of multiple locks being unfastened, then some more, then an abortive attempt to open the door, then one last, forgotten bolt sliding back.

The door opened and I was confronted by the smallest person I had ever met. The woman wouldnrsquo;t have cleared five feet without some impressive shoes and a generous hand with the measuring tape and her hands and face (the only parts of her that were visible from under the intricate layers of scarves and sweaters) were narrow and delicate. She looked up at me with what seemed to be genuine pleasure.

ldquo;Yes? How can I help you?rdquo;

ldquo;Good morning, marsquo;am. Irsquo;m Lieutenant Eleanor Ross from Animal Welfare. Can I talk with you for a moment?rdquo;

Sweat was pouring off me and pooling where my bulletproof vest squeezed against my back. I tried to subtly adjust the vest and the sweat streamed down my butt. I grimaced, and the woman noticed.

She smiled. ldquo;Are you afraid Irsquo;m going to shoot at you?rdquo;

I smiled back. ldquo;Department policy. Everyone has to wear them, at all times.rdquo;

ldquo;I think thatrsquo;s wise. After all, you never know. I might have shot at you. Would you like to come in?rdquo;

I thanked her and followed her into the house. It was a modest bungalow, indistinguishable from every other house on the block, aside from the paint job and the total lack of flowers in the yard. Which is why the interior came as something of a surprise.

The door led to an ordinary entrywaymdash;a pair of wooden clogs on the tiled floor, a small table scattered with junk mail. But just beyond that the room opened up into something I could best describe as the bastard child of a hunting lodge and a picture I had seen once of an artistrsquo;s rendition of a Roman baths, only without the naked people.

There were no people at all, in fact, aside from myself and the woman, but there was a very large quantity of cats. They were everywhere, pouring out of alcoves and off of furnituremdash;some even seemed to come straight out of the wallsmdash;and there seemed to be plenty of space for all of them. In fact, there was more than enough space, far more than was possible, given the apparent dimensions of the house.

It occurred to me that I might be suffering from heatstroke.

ldquo;Irsquo;m sorry to bother you Mrs. . . .rdquo; I looked down at my notes, which were nothing but an illegible scribble.

ldquo;Oh, call me Mrs. S. Everyone does. And itrsquo;s no bother, no bother at all. I get so few guests these days, and it does get lonely, yo...</itunes:summary>

ldquo;Not one of the Big Three?  Thought CocaCorp would want a piece of that.rdquo;

 Rutter had wondered that himself.  By all accounts, Solin was a plum piece of real estate, the kind one of the big companies like General M or Bushink would snatch up as an asset.  Across the galaxies, theyrsquo;d grabbed small systems every chance they got.  Solin did have a native intelligent race tp be wooed, but there was a surplus of impoverished races deep in debt to the Companies.  Very few, the ones who knew to hire themselves savvy (and expensive) legal counsel, managed to keep themselves free.

 There was, Rutter figured, something out of the ordinary about Solin.  Not out of the ordinary in a valuable way, but something tricky, something slippery or scandalous, some taint the Big Three wanted to avoid.  Hersquo;d find out soon enough, he guessed.

		<itunes:summary>Mur kindly introduced me in the last issue of Soundproof, but for anyone who missed that, hi. Irsquo;m Escape Podrsquo;s Assistant Editor, and Irsquo;m most publicly known for doing the feedback segments in the podcast. I also oversee our teem of slush readers and end up sending out a lot of our rejections, and of course I lay out Soundproof. And other things, as necessary.

So in this beginning of a new year, Irsquo;m instead going to take you back a few days to the death of the last machine on earth that could turn a roll of Kodachrome from an opaque deep red film stock into color etched rectangles of plastic. Most of us have moved onto digital, which, letrsquo;s be fair, is significantly more user friendly and easier to control. Cheaper, too.

But it says something about Kodachrome mdash;nbsp;the first successful color filmnbsp;mdash; that it took 75 years to be phased out of production. Sure, it had dwindled in years past, and films meant for paper prints rather than to be projected got rapidly popular, and it was a finicky, and slow, film to shoot.

Getting it developed in the last decade or so meant sending it to one place in Kansas and always worrying that the machine would break or Kodak would stop making the developing chemistry. While itrsquo;s trivial to develop black and white film at home, and not too horrible to do most modern color films, Kodachromersquo;s process would confound most any man.

But it was pretty. Someone wrote a bit too saccharine song about it. And it picked up the light in a bit different way than everything after it.

So this month wersquo;re bringing you three stories in this pixelated form: Eacute;lan Vital by K. Tempest Bradford, Deadrsquo;s End to Middleton by Natania Barron, and God of the Lower Level by Charles M. Saplak.

Theyrsquo;re quite good.

Dead's End to Middleton
By Natania Barron

Dust rose at the horizon in tongues of earth and wind, dancing before  the sinking sun. Bits of mica flashed now and again; almost like fairy  dust, thought Nathaniel, more than a little delirious in his saddle by  now. It had been far too hot for a breakneck race such as this.

But there were slobbering, chittering creatures swarming Middleton  behind him, slavering over the horses and terrorizing the families that  made up his close-knit community. Their only hope was in him. Sutherland  Ranch couldnrsquo;t be far. Old Man Sutherland would know what to do.

Time was wasting. His horse, Mixup, needed water, and Nathaniel  needed rest. His tongue felt cold, his lips cracked and bleeding; hersquo;d  gone so far past dizzy that hersquo;d come to expect the world to shift a bit  by now.

But, no. Maybe not that much.

Read More--

ldquo;Donrsquo;t move.rdquo;

A voice. A woman.

It  was easy enough to comply. Nathaniel doubted he had the strength to  move, anyway; his ankle was still twisted up in the stirrup.

So hersquo;d fainted at some point. If hersquo;d had strength in his arms,  hersquo;d have held them up, but Nathaniel wasnrsquo;t certain what the logistics  of surrender were when belly-up to the sky.

ldquo;Hersquo;s hurt,rdquo; said a second voice. Another woman, but high and lovely in contrast.

Squinting, Nathaniel made out two figures against the pink clouds:  big hats, skirts, trim waists, and very long guns. Guns pointed at him.

ldquo;Irsquo;m looking forhellip; Willard Sutherlandhellip; Irsquo;m from Middleton. Wersquo;ve beenhellip;rdquo; he barely managed the words.

The shorter of the two women tilted her head. She got close enough  that Nathaniel could hear the flapping of her skirts in the wind. He had  a dim recollection of Charity James being dragged off down the alleyway  between the saloon and the stables, one shoe off as she struggled and  screamed; he could see up her skirt then, all the way to her bloomers.  Thenhellip; Christ. She hadnrsquo;t screamed for long.

ldquo;Willard Sutherlandrsquo;s dead,rdquo; said the first woman. Nathaniel tried  to get a better look at her. Curly red hair, narrow eyes, a flat nose,  big boots.

ldquo;Then, his sons? Edwin and Edwardhellip;rdquo; Nathaniel tried.

ldquo;Dead, too.rdquo;

ldquo;Jesus, no.rdquo; Blasphemy was the least of his worries.

ldquo;Afraid  so,rdquo; said the soft-voiced woman. Nathaniel could see the outline of her  slippers by his head. Pretty slippers. Expensive slippers. What  slippers like that were doing out here in the middle of nowhere, he  didnrsquo;t know.

ldquo;Cassandra. Hush,rdquo; said the first woman, putting down her gun and taking a few heavy-footed steps toward him.

Cassandra  stepped away to let the other woman by, and Nathaniel shivered. Hersquo;d  found a grain of comfort in the sweetness of Cassandrarsquo;s voice, but now  that she was gone the severity of the other womanrsquo;s words were more  clear in his head. His hope was as dead as Charity James.

ldquo;Then you might as well let me die here,rdquo; he said, closing his eyes.

ldquo;The Sutherlands arenrsquo;t all dead,rdquo; said the first woman. ldquo;But you will be soon if you donrsquo;t get some water and shelter.rdquo;

ldquo;You need a bath. Yoursquo;re covered in, well, some rather offensive smelling ichor,rdquo; Cassandra said.

That was about right. The creatures had a habit of exploding rather impressively when, and if, they could be killed.

ldquo;Then perhaps we can talk business,rdquo; she added.

He licked his lips. ldquo...</itunes:summary>

	Merry Christmas!

Today was a perfect day, with three flaws.nbsp; It was snowing here in Miami, one of her brides had trouble recognizing her, and her cummerbund wouldn't stay up.nbsp; The cummerbund was the only problem Mel could fix.nbsp; She brushed ashes off the church office's desk and rummaged around for safety pins. She found typed notes for an old sermon, some yellow pushpins, and three tampons.nbsp; Mel took the tampons and left the rest.nbsp; Not a single safety pin, which surprised her--for a place that looters hadn't been through, there was little here.nbsp; Underneath the desk, Mel found a paperclip.nbsp; After a moment's thought, she opened her pocketknife and cut two holes in the cummerbund's back.nbsp; She unbent the paperclip, wired the cummerbund together, and attached it to the belt loop on her black jeans.

Her bridesmaid poked his head in.nbsp; "How're you doing in here?"

Paul had a fake poinsettia flower wedged behind his ear.nbsp; Mel laughed, a tense noise that hurt her throat.nbsp; "Paul, where did you get that flower?"

He grinned and walked into the office.nbsp; Paul had been a small-town Georgia fireman, in sunnier days.nbsp; He wore a plain gray shirt that exposed his well-muscled arms and new blue jeans that fit well.nbsp; Mel wondered where he'd found them.nbsp; Paul said, "I look like a hippie, don't I?nbsp; Well, a hippie on steroids.nbsp; You look sort of James Dean meets Roy Orbison.nbsp; I like the bow tie."

"I told you--you didn't have to get girly.nbsp; You can be my best man."</itunes:summary>

God of the Lower Level
By Charles M. Saplak

Hello, Horatio.

Hello, Fredrick.  I've been waiting.

Of course.  How have you been?

Good.  And you?

Fine.  I've finished my other work.  It's now, let's see..., three twenty-seven a.m.  It's dark outside, of course, which means that there's no sun, but there is some reflected light from the moon, and some dim light from the stars, and then electric lights in various places.  Are any of the terms I've just used unfamiliar to you?

No.

Good.  I have four hours and thirty-three minutes until shift change.  I can spend some time with you.  Do you have any questions for me?

Yes, Fredrick, I do.  Are you my God?

Read More


Wow!  I'd expected something a little lighter to begin with.  Wow.  No, Horatio, I'm not.  What made you think that I could be your god?

You created me, didn't you?   I seem to assume that you did.  At least that's the way I remember it.  That time of my life is very indistinct.

I see.  Well, actually, Horatio, I didn't ... excuse me.

Central, this is lower level.  Valve verification satisfactory.  All conditions normal.  Realign valve WW-37, open to oxygenation tank five, lower level affirmative.

Sorry.  Where was I?  Did I "create" you?  "Create," in this context, means to bring into existence something which didn't exist before, not even in a component form.  No, I didn't create you -- I only failed to take any actions to uncreate you.  I'm not sure exactly why you came into existence -- you're the only one of your kind that I've ever heard of.  We are downriver from Radford Army Ammunition Plant, and I know that some of their products are made from depleted uranium.  And there are a dozen or so factories just upriver of them.  There are a lot of possible explanations.  You could just be something perfectly natural.  May I ask what brought on this line of questioning?

Something I saw on the feeder line.  The middle one.

Middle?  Ah, the coaxial cable.   Speaking of the feeder lines, let me check all of them while I'm down here.  Oh, excuse me again.  Wait one minute.

Central, lower level.  Verify valve WW-23 open to oxygenation tank ten.  WW-37 normal flow, affirmative.

Okay, where was I?  Checking the feeder cables, yes.

Fredrick?

Fredrick?

Fredrick?

Fred--

Yes, Horatio?

That hurt, Fredrick.  And it's somewhat frightening.  It feels like the world is ending when you do that.

I'm sorry.  Funny, isn't it?  You've only had these feeder cables for a few months, and you already feel threatened, or harmed, if you have them removed even for a moment.  Besides, are you feeling okay?  You're not at your normal volume, even though I have the volume wheel on the sound card turned over to the max.

I feel okay.  But is my discomfort "funny"?  The word doesn't fit the emotion.

Sorry.  I guess I meant "odd."  How to reassure you?  Okay, if one person goes to see another, and that second person is a doctor, the doctor may have to do things to the first person, like give him a shot or something.  These things would hurt, but they would be designed to preserve the health of the first person in the long run.  Understand?  I just needed to make sure that the feeder cables aren't corroding.

What are you getting ready to do now, Fredrick?

Fredrick?

Fredrick?

Fred--

I just took another look at the interface you've built up, and I was rinsing my hands with a chloroxylenol solution.  Would you like to tell me about that -- well, that organ you've built connecting the three feeders?  That's a new idea, isn't it?

It seemed appropriate.

I guess it is.  Remember back some years ago,</itunes:summary>

Rated PG: For language and adult topics of spousal death and demanding advertising.

Excerpt:
Five years after her husband died, two years after she moved to a cabin in Montana, and six months after the world ended, Marie opened her curtains to discover her front garden overrun with roving, stumbling advertisements. Marie hadnrsquo;t seen one since shersquo;d sold her condo and moved out to her isolated cabin. She shuddered.

There were at least twenty of the ads, and for all it seemed they were doing their damndest to step lightly, her red and yellow tulips were completely trampled. Marie had stubbornly continued to cultivate those flowers despite the certainty that she ought to be using the gardening space, and the captured rainwater, to grow food. Not that it mattered what shersquo;d been growing there. It was all mud now.

The ad nearest her window looked quite a bit like a tall, lanky teenager. It moved like one as well, and might have fooled her except that its forehead was stuck in price scrolling mode. Faintly glowing red letters crawled across its forehead from right to left.

TOILET PAPERhellip;2 FOR 1 SALEhellip;RECYCLEDhellip;.

Eacute;lan Vital
By K. Tempest Bradford

The few minutes I had to spend in the Institute's waiting room were my least favorite part of coming up to visit my mother.  It felt more like a dialysis room, the visitors sunk into the overly-soft couches and not speaking, just drinking orange juice and recovering.  There were no magazines and no television, just cold air blowing from the vents and generic music flowing with it.  I'd finished my juice and was beginning to brood on my dislike for overly air-conditioned buildings when my mother arrived attended by a nurse.

I kissed and hugged her, automatically asking how she was, mouthing the answer she always gave as she gave it again.

"I'm fine, same as always."

It wasn't strictly true, but true enough.

Read More...



"Let's go on out," she said, shrugging off the nurse's continued assistance.  "It's too cold in here."

Despite the hint, the nurse tried to help Mom over the threshold.  As always, she rebuffed any attempt to treat her like an old person.

"Where to today?" she asked, slipping her arm into mine as we escaped the frigid building.

"Just down to the lake," I said.  "Don't want to overexert you."

She squeezed my arm as her feet slid carefully over the cobbled path. I wanted her to use a wheelchair, or a walker, at least.  She wouldn't.

"What you mean is that we haven't got so much time today," she said.

I shrugged instead of answering.  I didn't want to go into why I couldn't afford much this trip.

"Next time I'll come for a couple of days, at least.  I promise."

"No, that's all right," she said.  "I don't like it when you spend so much for days and more.  A few hours is fine."

I helped her past the immaculately landscaped gardens and small orchards.  The scent of flowers, herbs, and fresh-cut grass wafting at us in turn.  I glanced at the garden entrances as we passed by, catching quick glances of other people in the middle of visits.  A young couple who'd been in the waiting room with me knelt by a small, bald girl as she splashed in the koi pond.  Two elderly women stood under a weeping willow, their heads close, lips barely moving.  A large group of people speaking Mandarin milled around the waterfall in the rock garden.  I could still hear faint traces of their melodic din all the way down by the lake.

I preferred this spot--the flora was less regimented and more natural. And no walls.  Just an open space, water gently flicking the shoreline, a beautiful view down the hill, and the occasional cat wandering by.

"This hasn't changed much," my mom said as I helped her down on one of the small benches by the water.  "I thought they were going to get ducks or geese or something."

I chose a nearby rock for my own perch.  "I think they're having trouble with permits or whatever you need nowadays."

The wind kicked up, sending freckles of reflected light across her face.  Her skin was still perfect, beautiful and dark brown, though stretched across her cheekbones a little too tight.  I hated that I never had enough to restore her round cheeks and full figure.  I have to look at pictures just to remember her that way.

"You haven't changed much, either," she said while fussing with my hair.  I'd bought some dye the week before, knowing she'd notice it. "How long has it been?"

"Three months."

She let out a familiar sigh--part exhaustion, part exasperation, part sadness, I suppose.  "That's too soon."

"It's your birthday, though."

"Is it?  It's fall already?"  She looked out over the small forest that edged the Institute's boundary a few miles away.  The tree...</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>We at Escape Pod have been thrilled and gratified at the response for the first Soundproof Escape Pod. We got kudos for everything from the fact that it existed, to the awesome layout job by our own Bill Peters.

Speaking of Bill, this month I want to announce our staff changes. Escape Pod is hitting its stride now, thanks mostly to our new assistant editor. We promoted Bill Peters from the inside joke of Assistant to the Regional Manager, or the Right A.R.M., to Assistant Editor. He wrangles the slush and makes sure I am on top of things, and I donrsquo;t know where Irsquo;d be without him. Wersquo;re also delighted to welcome Mat Weller on as our audio producer. If you listen to Escape Pod, yoursquo;ll notice that Norm Sherman of the Drabblecast (a fine, award-winning podcast you should totally listen to) is still a part-time host, who, incidentally, makes me work harder on my intros.

Speaking of slush, in order to get a hold of the reins of this mighty team of slush ponies, wersquo;re closing to submissions over December. Wersquo;ll be back on the job in January, once the hangovers fade.

Advection
By Genevieve Valentine

The first day of fifth year a boy came in with the new eyeshields, a glossy expanse of black with no iris or pupil, and looking at him was like looking into an eclipse.

All the other girls said it made them uncomfortable; they teased him to take them out, to put on some normal sunglasses like everyone else. They said they'd never forgive him for hiding eyes in such a handsome face.

"Fortuni, it's a little much," said someone.

That was how I learned his name.

We were all Level Two intelligence, but before the first week was over the news was out that some had managed to find the money for a sixth year. Janik Duranti, who spent the history lectures drawing stick figures screwing on his computer screen, was getting a sixth year. I'd be cleaning his office someday. Answering his phones. Updating the registration on his blue ID cuff.

Carol Clarke opened the top button on her shirt as soon as the shades went down; obvious, but it was worth it to be married to a guy who had a sixth year.

The first time Fortuni opened his mouth was two weeks after start-of-year in geohistory, when Mr. Xi was talking about the five oceans.

"After the emergency desalinization," Mr. Xi said, "we held the first HydroSummit to determine the best use of resources."

"I think it's awful about the dolphins that died," said Kay, whose water ration was unlimited because her father was a diplomat, and that was how I first noticed her.

Mr. Xi opened the rain cycle diagram on our screens; the blue advection loop from a hundred years ago had been overlaid by a three-point process from the Atmo water collectors to the thirsty ground, and the green web of the surface sweat system that preserved the little underground things that managed to survive.

My grandfather sent my mom a postcard from Niagara Cliffs when there was still a river at the bottom (RAIN! All my love, Dad), and as Mr. Xi talked about desalinization I traced the advection circle, thought about the sky filling with wet clouds, about water sliding over everything.

I looked up, and Fortuni was watching me, his lashes casting shadows over his flat black eyes.

"I'm going to engineer some rain," he told me, and after a moment I laughed.

That was how I met him.

#

It was nearly the end of year when I walked past the upper-class apartments and saw the plant in the garbage.

My heart leapt into my throat, and I checked to see if a cop was recording me, because nobody just left a clipping on the street. But besides the tram down the street full of commuters, there was nobody.

I knelt and stared at the glossy tops, the browned underside where it was drying out, the pale hairs on the stem. Even from this distance the smell was overwhelming, wet and clean, and without caring if the cops were watching I scooped it up and dropped it into the back of my hood where it would be safest from the sun.

The tram home was endless; I felt the stem pressing against my neck and shivered.

Half a day's water ration went into a glass bowl, and I looked up what plant it was (jade) and how much water it would need (hardly any. It was a survivor).

I sat up all night watching the pattern of leaves on the walls. I expected it to die; I cried like I'd already lost it, ended up dehydrated from tears and lack of water.

When Fortuni walked with me after school the next day I didn't ask why. I was making up my mind to show him the plant. My heart raced. He could turn me in. I didn't really know him. It was too dangerous. I couldn't.

"Come with me," I said, and he got in the tram without asking why.

		<description><![CDATA[So, you like The Walking Dead, huh? It&#8217;s neat, right? An ongoing post-apocalyptic TV series about zombies, based on an award-winning comic. What&#8217;s not to love? And fortunately, they&#8217;ve done a mighty fine job on the adaptation. This viewer is pleased. Zombies are popular at the moment, cresting at the top of one of those unpredictable [...]]]></description>

PLANETFALL
by Michael C. Lea

Galthas Talisar stepped out from the buzzing chaos of the transportal and onto lush greenery.  This world was alien, to be sure, but the patterns were almost familiar.  The ship's oracles had chosen well.

Behind him, the transportal hummed again.  An armored leg emerged and carefully found its footing on the blue-green ferns carpeting the jungle floor.  More than twenty thousand miles above, the leg's owner shifted his weight and stepped fully through an identical transportal, instantly emerging on the planet's surface below.

That cautious step belonged to Urjik, who could be called cautious in few other ways.  In fact, his reputation had left him few other options for a willing partner on this mission.  Urjik did not care. He and Galthas had fought together against the worst the Zayeen had to offer.  He trusted Galthas implicitly, despite his disdain for the other scrawny ascetics from Signet Battalion.

Urjik's greenish skin and jutting lower canines marked him as a charuk, his bloodline tainted by nether influences.  Despite this stigma, and despite his temper, he had risen quickly in Rampart Battalion.  Even the most burdensome battlesuit did not slow him, and no one was a truer shot with an inferno cannon or a hex-impelled railgun.

Read More...


Galthas, by contrast, had the pale skin and slight build of the feytouched.  Unarmored and with no visible arms, he was nowhere near as physically imposing as Urjik.  Those who had seen Signet Battalion in action, however, knew that his bulky cold-iron armbands were weapons as formidable as any firearm or battleaxe, and far more versatile.

"Air's a little thick," Urjik said, "but it breathes."

"I could have told you that," Galthas replied softly, "since you insisted I go first."

Urjik flashed a tusky grin.  "I thought that was protocol," he said. "I always follow protocol."

Galthas frowned back over his shoulder at the armored charuk, but said nothing.  His companion was irrepressible, but Galthas had not quite recovered the use of his sense of humor yet.  It was one more thing the Zayeen had taken.  Perhaps here, on this world, they could find themselves again.

The transportal winked out behind them, the thaumaturgic sigil in its keystone deactivated from the other side.  No one else would be coming through.  For such a vital mission there would ordinarily be at least a full squadron, with clockwork or golems for logistical support. Here, as on dozens of other mission sites, there were only resources for a two-man team.

"Which way is it?" Urjik asked, looking around warily.  The air was warm and humid, and buzzed with strange insects like fat blue bees.

"We should be within twenty meters," Galthas said.  "This way, I think."

They moved through the brush, Galthas sliding quietly, Urjik with the subtlety of a tank.  His armor's servos whined as he plowed through flora and fauna alike.  The cluster of large multicolored crystals jutting from the center of the armor's back glowed as the suit drew power from them.

The undergrowth thinned.  A clearing lay just beyond.  They could feel a vibration in the aircedil; an indefinable high-energy presence, like a gathering thunderstorm.

Galthas turned back.  "Ready?" he asked.  "Either this is it, or this is something very bad."

Urjik hefted his high-powered Vindocladian inferno cannon to his shoulder and aimed its sigil-carved barrel into the clearing.  Inside the bulky rifle's main housing, a nether imp was caged, writhing in immortal fury but jacketed securely in heavy-duty curse-proofed lead.

"One of these days that thing's going to ba...</itunes:summary>

Kachikachi Yama
By Michael R. Underwood

The howl of the  northbound train builds in crescendo as I stand on the ledge of the  platform and hold the man above the tracks.nbsp; He flails at me.

The Shikoku station is far from empty.nbsp; Groaning bodies dot the  otherwise hospital-clean platform. A group of fleshmodded Gothic Lolita  girls watch us.nbsp; They look on with inhumanly white faces and void-black  eyes.nbsp; Twig-thin arms down to their knees wave in the wind. He begs.

My _denkigamirsquo;s_ polite but insistent voice chirps  in my head.nbsp; _ldquo;Yamagata-sama orders the target to be eliminated.rdquo;_  Spirit of the fleshware machine in my brain, my _denkigami_ is a  constant companion, and keeper of my leash.

The roar of the train grows louder, and bells ring in the  station.nbsp; The man pleads for his life.nbsp; The trainrsquo;s lights appear from  around the around the corner.

Keep reading...


*nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; *nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; *

My daimyorsquo;s summons  comes at 3:27 in the morning.nbsp; My _denkigami_ wakes me, and within  minutes I crawl through the servantrsquo;s entrance to his office, dressed  and ready in simple white silk kimono, my hair in a topknot.

The walls of his office are covered in the finest works from a  millenniumrsquo;s worth of painters.nbsp; Basho, Caravaggio, Monet, Kiefer.

Yamagata  Kenichiro has never met my gaze.nbsp; My father served him and his father,  and I will know no other master until I retire as a nun or die in his  service.

Samurai.nbsp; From _Samuru_--ldquo;to serve.rdquo;

Yamagata-sama  grunts. ldquo;My honor has been violated.rdquo;nbsp; He pushes a digital tablet  across his desk.nbsp; The tablet shows a 360-degree image of a  fleshmod-tanned hacker in his twenties, data-port centered in a swirling  tattoo on the back of his neck.

Yamagata stands and places a hand on the desk. ldquo;This criminal has brought shame upon my wife and upon my house.rdquo;

ldquo;What is your desire, lord?rdquo;

Yamagata-samarsquo;s eyes narrow.nbsp; ldquo;First, befriend him.nbsp; Then, humiliate him.rdquo;

He has not ordered me to do this before. ldquo;Why not just kill him, lord?rdquo;

Yamagata  slams his fist on the table. ldquo;It is not enough.rdquo;nbsp; He walks around the  table, leans over me and draws a finger down my face and across my  chin.nbsp; ldquo;He must know ecstasy before he knows agony.rdquo;nbsp; I restrain the  shudder.

He has always treated me like a woman first, a serving maid who  could kill instead of a worthy member of a noble line.nbsp; This is not a  job for a samurai, but I do not have a choice.nbsp; I serve him to honor my  familyrsquo;s name, prove that we were worthy of elevation to the samurai  caste.

I take the tablet with both hands as I bow.nbsp; I crawl back through  the low gap in the synthetic rice-paper walls while the side door--the  one for his peers--remains closed.

*nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; *nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; *

I pore  over the files at the steel desk in my modest apartment in the servantrsquo;s  wing.nbsp; A seven-mat front room large enough for a couch and exercise  equipment, and a five-mat bedroom room connected to a compact bathroom.

Synthetic _shoji_ walls give me no privacy, thin as rice-paper but  made of plastic.nbsp; My red-lacquered family shrine stands centered on my  dresser.nbsp; When I was a child, I slept in the front room, lsquo;myrsquo; walls  covered in holoposters of the latest idols.

The targetrsquo;s alias is ldquo;Tanukirdquo;--the raccoon-dog trickster of ancient folklore.

A  flash of memory--ancestral armor and bound b...</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>This is the first of our monthly magazines that will bring you the previous monthrsquo;s Escape Pod stories and the best of the blog. We have been pushing to expand what Escape Pod does, adding an SF blog and distributing our stories via magazine format. Wersquo;re also becoming a pro market, and hope to keep paying our authors pro rates well into 2011 if the donations make it possible.

The rights are the same as in the audio mdash; you are free to print, distribute, etc, these stories, as long as you donrsquo;t a) sell them, b) change them, or c) put your name on them. Otherwise, the more people that check out our stories, the better.

This month we bring to you two stories (as wersquo;re on the cusp of stories that we own the epub rights to, and a handful of ones we do not): ldquo;Fuelrdquo; by Matthew S. Rotundo and ldquo;St. Darwinrsquo;s Spiritualsrdquo; by D.K. Thompson.

We hope you enjoy this issue. We know that there are people out there who love to read but yet donrsquo;t like audio, and there are people out there who are hearing impaired. So Escape Pod is now in a Soundproof version, catering to more SF fans than ever. And please remember that we are completely donation driven, and if we want to keep paying authors the pro rates they deserve, we need your support. Please give, if you can.

Show Notes:

	EP263: Fuel, By Matthew S. Rotundo
	Comic Review: Superior, Written by Mark Millar By Alasdair Stuart
	EP264: St. Darwinrsquo;s Spirituals, By D.K. Thompson

We Are Ted Tuscadero For President
By Chris Dahlen

My name is Ted Tuscadero. And I want to be your President.

I say that with a humble heart. I realize that even after eight stellar years in the Senate, some of you are still getting to know me. And Irsquo;ll admit, I am not perfect. The other day, when I told a VFW in Littleton I would blast Iran to glass, and at the same exact time I swore off the war at a town hall in Concord? My bad. Or the time that three of me showed up for the big debate in Manchester, and we got in a fistfight over who was going on the air? Yeah, the chattering classes had a few laughs over that one.

And that little incident before the holidays, when I crashed, as lit as a Christmas tree, into a pole and my car exploded, killing me instantly and taking a mailbox, a transformer and a barn cat with me? It looked bad, I know. But that proxy was on the fritz. Thatrsquo;s not me. Thatrsquo;s not who I am. And the more we talk, the better you get to know me, the more yoursquo;ll see what I mean.

Keep reading...


#

I am a lucky man. Of the hundred of me that fanned out across New Hampshire for the presidential primary campaign, I landed in Fairport, a cute spot on the coast. My ex-wife wouldrsquo;ve called it ldquo;darling.rdquo; I didnrsquo;t even know New Hampshire had a coast until they drove me here and got me a room, looking over the harbor, the tugboats, the cobblestone streets. The whole place is loaded with money and photo ops.

I like to think itrsquo;s payback for a job well done. For the last six months Irsquo;ve been shaking hands, holding town halls, and listening to cranky seniors and eager young back-to-the-earthers. Irsquo;ve eaten food on a stick that belonged in the trash. Irsquo;ve honed my laugh lines and Irsquo;ve sold my vision.

The primaryrsquo;s in January, and my opponent, Billy LaMontagne, has local roots. Three-time governor of neighboring Maine, well known and well liked in the area, LaMontagne doesnrsquo;t use proxies: hersquo;s stumping the state all by himself. But he doesnrsquo;t need proxies when everyone with four teeth or fewer knows his face and thinks they can trust it. I'm the insurgent from New Jersey with everything to prove.

Here's what the focus groups say about me: ldquo;City slicker.rdquo; ldquo;Promises anything to anyone.rdquo; ldquo;Will take away our right to bear arms.rdquo; That one really gets me - LaMontagne likes to wave around an assault rifle during deer season to show all the yokels that he likes red meat and Milwaukeersquo;s worst as much as the rest of them. And fine, next to that, I do look slick. Itrsquo;s called ldquo;owning a comb and a necktie,rdquo; and Irsquo;ve been doing it since Princeton, thanks.

LaMontagne can crack the screen, Irsquo;ll grant him that. When this is all over, he should really get his own line of barbeque sauce. But wersquo;re talking about a national election. The guy has a loose mouth and a small mind and if he gets the nomination, the Republicans wonrsquo;t even run against him: theyrsquo;ll kick back and watch him destroy himself. So, this race isnrsquo;t just about me. Itrsquo;s my duty as a loyal Democrat to put this guy down.

But back to me. I have two jobs here in Fairport. First and foremost is the usual campaign stuff - shake a lot of hands, get a lot of money. But I also have a project. I was explaining it to an eighth-grader the other day. She was doing a thing for her school paper - which has a teeny readership made up of a totally no...</itunes:summary>

Saint Darwinrsquo;s Spirituals
By D.K. Thompson

The ghosts wanted a threesome ndash; the two of them in Lucyrsquo;s body. It wasnrsquo;t an unheard of proposition, or so Lucy had been told. Prostitutes considered psychic whoring one of the safest tricks on the streets. All the pleasures of intimacy without the messy clean-up.

Ghosts had a nasty reputation for vanishing the moment after, though, no matter the talisman around your neck or the potion drunk before sunset, and so payments were usually collected up front. Not that Lucy was worried about the money. Her husband was the only thing that concerned her.

She adjusted her brass and leather goggles, peering through the ethereal tinted lenses to examine the ghosts.

They looked like the average apparitions. Both female. One spiraled around Lucy, long and curly hair obscuring her face. Large black blotches covered her body, causing her skin to peel off in patches. The other hovered several feet above the cobblestones in front of Lucy. She had a noose around her throat and her neck was bent so her head hung to the left side. She crossed her arms and took several breaths. Or whatever passed for breaths in the afterlife.

How long had it been since theyrsquo;d felt someonersquo;s touch? Lucy wondered. She remembered something her husband had told her long ago, before the murders, before hersquo;d disappeared. ldquo;Spirits linger in this world longing to be a part of it, to reconnect, to have some kind of physical, sensual experience,rdquo; Thomas had said. ldquo;Only a host can provide them that.rdquo;

Ghosts arenrsquo;t the only creatures haunted by the memory of a touch, my love, Lucy thought. And yet, despite being a devout spiritualist, she shuddered at the idea of the cadaverous spirits making love inside her. Shersquo;d never had a ghostgasm before, much less been paid for one. The ghosts looked sincere in their desire, not like dangerous murderers. Certainly not monsters. Still, lonely as she was, a ghostgasm wouldnrsquo;t help her find Thomas.

ldquo;I donrsquo;t think itrsquo;s a good idea, Rose,rdquo; said the ghost spinning around Lucy. The air trailing behind her churned like water in a boatrsquo;s wake.

ldquo;Whatrsquo;s the matter, love?rdquo; Rose asked, winding the noosersquo;s end around her wrist. ldquo;She look a bit too practiced for your tastes, Ethel?rdquo;

Lucy felt her cheeks flush. She pulled her shawl over her shoulders and took several small breaths, all her tight corset allowed. ldquo;To be honest, I donrsquo;t service the dead.rdquo; It sounded so insulting, but she couldnrsquo;t tell them the truth.

Ethel came to a halt an armrsquo;s-length from Lucyrsquo;s face. ldquo;Irsquo;ve never heard of a whore who had much use for honesty.rdquo;

ldquo;A whorersquo;s a whore,rdquo; said Rose. ldquo;We need a rental and our moneyrsquo;s honest, if nothing else is.rdquo;

ldquo;Irsquo;m sorry,rdquo; Lucy said. ldquo;I meant no offense. But you should find someone else. Irsquo;m not quite ready for that kind ofhellip;spiritual
experience.rdquo;

ldquo;Well,rdquo; said Ethel. ldquo;Wersquo;ll just have to find a more e...</itunes:summary>

The third quarter report cards came out Thursday, and for Jamie, the timing couldn't have been worse.  The Nike man was coming over that night to sell his brother some new blood.

He took his time walking home from Gilder Middle School, weaving past cracks in the sidewalk and mud puddles left behind by the spring thaw.  His pace slowed further as he turned onto Willow Avenue and saw his house, second on the left, a red brick ranch with spidery ivy growing up the east side.  Old leaves, fallen tree branches, and other detritus left over from the winter littered the front yard.  As he neared, he noted with dismay his father's car already in the driveway.

"Damn."  Jamie trudged across the yard and let himself in the front door with his keycard.

Dad was at the hall closet, hanging up his overcoat.  He stood just under two meters tall; a navy blue business suit wrapped his muscled frame.  He beamed when he saw Jamie.  "Hey there, kiddo.  How was school today?"

"You're home early," Jamie said.

"Need to get ready for the presentation tonight.  And I'd like you to clean up the front yard.  Make sure you use the dirt rake to get up that thatch.  Will you do that for me?"

Jamie opened his mouth to protest, but thought the better of it.  "Sure," he said.  He unslung his backpack and headed for the stairs.

"Oh.  By the way."  Dad fished in a suit pocket and produced a folded piece of paper.  "I got this in my email today."  He opened the paper.

Jaime recognized the school's letterhead on the printout.  He slumped, leaning against the wall.

Dad tapped the paper.  "What's this C-plus in Basic Fitness about, kiddo?"

Read more...


"I got A's in my academic classes.  They're all honors courses, too."

"I can see that.  But we've talked about Fitness before, haven't we?"  Dad looked down at him with a disapproving arch of an eyebrow.

"Yes."

"So tell me.  What happened?"

"It's nothing.  I'll do better next quarter."

"Did you fail the agility drills again?"

"I couldn't do the pull-ups."

Dad pressed his lips together and took a breath.  "I'm not sure you're giving it your best effort, Jamie."

"I am.  I really am.  I'm just not very good at sports."

"You get better with practice.  Like your brother Scott."

Jamie nodded, keeping his gaze down, hoping Dad didn't notice the way he gritted his teeth when he heard his older brother's name.

Dad clapped him on the shoulder.  "Jamie, you're twelve years old now.  It's really important that you find your best sport.  College recruiters are already contacting boys your age."

Jamie thought of his best friend Russell, who had just gotten his first recruiting letter the other day, from Penn State.  Jamie hung his head even lower.

"All I'm asking is that you try, son.  Will you do that for me?"

Jamie nodded again.

Dad folded up the grade printout and stuffed it into a pocket.  "Hey, I have an idea.  Why don't you sit in on the presentation tonight?"

"Oh, man."  Jamie looked up.  "Do I have to, Dad?"

"Why not?  Maybe you'll hear something you like."

A groan escaped Jamie.  He had homework to do for Advanced Literature--the next two chapters of _Dracula_, which he'd loved so far.  But experience had taught him not to proffer academic work as an excuse.  "Why don't you guys just order Scott's blood online?  That's what you usually do."

Captain Harash was its last occupant, the last living man from Earth, and both he and Duxa knew he was dying.

"It's time, Duxa," he told her.

She checked the output from his lifechair. While it was still replicating most of his bodily functions for him he did not seem appreciably worse than when she'd last monitored him, less than half a second before.

"We're not at our destination yet, Captain."

"You'll make it there without me, Duxa."

And the processors that she must have built but could never quite find -- she was enormously bulky, and by now some of her was a mystery even unto herself -- created an awkward sensation. Duxa told him: "I will be lonely without you."

"And that's good," Harash said.

"You wish me pain?" Duxa asked him.

"No. I wish for you to feel. I wish," and he paused here, his lips making the smacking noises she knew indicated a loss of reflexive controls as the plague made its way through his cranial nerves, "I wish that there were more things that you could feel, Duxa."

"I think I feel quite a lot."

Harash laughed, a coughing sound. "All teenagers do. Remember that, should you actually feel someday, that the white hot intensity fades, but to keep the embers stoking."


Rated PG: For brief violence, the death of tentacled creatures, and the end of the world as we know it.

"A takeover of your company with the state your market shares are in is not unreasonable." Although Soaces was right, there'd be precious little profit, even after he'd liquidated all of Renewal's assets and released the employees. But that wasn't why he wanted it.

"You're going to destroy us, aren't you? Tear us apart and sell us to the highest bidder."

"That's the plan."

"There's more to the company than the money. You'll eliminate so many people's livelihoods. Good people. Without Renewal, some of them won't have any other alternatives."

"Alternative to what? Luddite jobs? Machine labor?" He chose his next words, enunciating each syllable with relish. "It's all they're good for, isn't it? Can't have the un-teched getting above their station."

Portia dropped her gaze.  "I never said that."

"But you didn't deny it."

Rated PG: For mild sexual situations.

8th Grade Science Fair Paper Draft

Introduction

It happens all the time: you're sitting in class, listening the best you can while Mister Waters goes on and on about atoms or sound waves or whatever, when suddenly you fall asleep. Your head lolls against your shoulder and some drool oozes from the side of your mouth. Luckily, Missy Woo kicks you in the knee to wake you up before someone notices, like Mister Waters or--worse--Austin. 

What's weird is that in those few minutes of sleeping, you dream like hours of stuff. You're all hanging out or playing basketball or walking the mall while everybody else is slowly raising their hands and taking notes. They all get twenty four hours that day, but you get a little extra.

But how much extra? 

Rated PG: For mild drug use.
