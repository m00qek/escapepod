Playing Doctor
By Robert T. Jeschonek

The problem with having a crush on your mad scientist boss is, every day she doesn't see how wonderful you really are seems like the end of the world.

"This is all wrong!" says Dr. Hildegarde Medici, hurling the tray across her cavernous secret laboratory. nbsp;"You're a complete imbecile, Glue!"

Her words sting, but at least she's paying attention to me. nbsp;I'll take what I can get from the woman I love. nbsp;"I'm sorry, Dr. M. nbsp;Please let me try again."

"Everything is ruined." nbsp;With one arm, Dr. Medici sweeps notebooks and glass beakers from the table in front of her. nbsp;"Now I'll never finish the doomsday weapon today!"

As Dr. Medici throws her head down onto her folded arms on the table, I cross the lab and pick up the silver tray that she threw. nbsp;I see myself reflected in its surface--thick glasses, big nose, bald head, pure geek...not her type. nbsp;"I thought you liked the crinkle-cut ones," I say as I pluck chicken fingers and french fries from the floor and drop them onto the tray.

"Steak fries," says Dr. Medici without raising her head. nbsp;"How many times do I have to tell you, Glue?"


She is such a drama queen, but what do you expect? nbsp;Her line of work attracts a certain type of personality--passionate, temperamental, creative, flamboyant. nbsp;To tell you the truth, it's one of the things I love most about her.

"I could run to the store," I say, dumping the chicken and fries into a waste basket. nbsp;"By the time you're done building your doomsday weapon, I could have hot fries ready for you."

Dr. Medici rolls her eyes like a disgusted teenager. nbsp;"I can't concentrate on building a doomsday weapon on an empty stomach."

I know the feeling...the not being able to concentrate part, that is. nbsp;Most days, I can barely focus on my work instead of Dr. Medici's long black hair and bright green eyes. nbsp;Once, I was so distracted by Dr. M that I cross-wired the brain of a giant robot, which proceeded to rampage at a garbage dump instead of an army base.

If only I could tell her I love her. nbsp;If only I could close that final mile that has always stood between us.

If only I could finally set free the words that I've longed to speak, and she would turn to me and say the words I've longed to hear.

"Don't just stand there, you putz!" nbsp;She spins away from me on her work-stool. nbsp;"Get me a TV dinner out of the freezer or something!"

I don't take it personally. nbsp;I know it's just the stress talking. nbsp;She's been having a rough time lately, just like the rest of the mad scientist community.

Thanks a lot, terrorists.

#

In the good old days, mad scientists weren't considered public enemies like they are now. nbsp;They were tolerated, in fact, because the government loved getting its hands on their way-out inventions after their crazy schemes were thwarted.

But not anymore. nbsp;Not since the terrorists.

What difference is there between a politically motivated insane genius and one who is motivated by greed?

How can the government go after one group of people threatening to blow things up and not the other?

It can't.

As a result, business has dropped off considerably. nbsp;No one will negotiate in good faith with a mad scientist anymore. nbsp;Instead of musclebound private citizen thrill-seekers coming after us, we get black ops Special Forces and heat-seeking bunker-buster missiles courtesy of Homeland Security.

It's a tough time to be a mad scientist. nbsp;Lots of them have quit already and become street people or college professors.

But not my Hildegarde. nbsp;She won't give up that easily. Being a mad scientist has been her lifelong dream.

I know, because I grew up with...</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>You can download the ePub version here. 

This is the October issue, so I guess I should be sounding all spooky in the editorrsquo;s note, but That Holiday Which Must Be Feared is a month away, so instead why donrsquo;t we talk about reinvention.

Irsquo;m not that great at waiting out long serialized stories, and honestly with longer book series where the author is know for long stretches between novels (Cough-George-RR-Martin-Cough) I usually stop one before the last one out so I can at least control when Irsquo;ll restart the story. So comics have never been an ideal form for me, except for when the storylinersquo;s collected into a volume. Or, in the case of The Sandman, 10 volumes.

But wersquo;re a bit into DCrsquo;s reboot, and their reinvention means a bit more critical eye is being cast over their crop than would be if they hadnrsquo;t resorted to remaking themselves in the great American tradition. And while there are highs in the new crop, the lows have been getting most of the attention, because, well, while any reboot is going to lose you fans, it shouldnrsquo;t do this to young female fans: http://io9.com/5844355/

On a happier note, this is one-year anniversary of Escape Pod reinventing a bit of itself into a text product in addition to the audio coming into your ear canals every week. I think itrsquo;s been a success, but this is as good a point as any to stop and ask for feedback, so hit up feedback@escapepod.org with your suggestions for what we can do different/better in Soundproof.

This Soundproof is bringing you Lavie Tidharrsquo;s The Insurance Agent, Saladin Ahmedrsquo;s The Faithful Soldier, Prompted, and T. L. Morganfieldrsquo;s Night Bird Soaring. So itrsquo;s a strong issue.

Hope you enjoy it,

Night Bird Soaring
By T. L. Morganfield

On his sixth birthday, Totyoalli's parents took him to the holy city to  see the Emperor Cuauhtemoc, but the plane ride proved the most exciting  part. He kept his nose to the window, taking in the vast lands of the  One World, from the snow-capped mountains of his home in the northern  provinces to the open plains of Teotihuacan. He marveled at the  miniature cities and cars passing below. All his life he'd dreamt of  flying, ever since the first time he'd seen a bird gliding through the air.

From the airport, they took a cab to the royal palace on Lake Texcoco.  Tenochtitlan, the single largest city in the world, sprawled around it  for miles. The cab buzzed across one of the royal causeways, the water  blue and shimmering in the hot sun. Inside the walled royal complex  stood the Great Temple, meticulously maintained by a crew of thousands,  its sacred Sun Stone keeping watch over the visiting crowds.

At the palace, two genetically-engineered royal jaguar knights escorted  Totyoalli's family to the Emperor's gardens. Totyoalli watched their tails swish behind them, fascinated. Their heads looked so soft he  wished to pat them between the ears, but when he tried to talk to them,  they bared their fangs and gripped their spears a little tighter.



Ahead, a doorway opened onto a stone patio overlooking an expanse of  grass and trees. Marigolds and birds of paradise choked the flower beds.  Cranes stepped gingerly through the ponds while monkeys chattered in  the trees.

The Revered Speaker stood at the crest of the nearest hill, his hands  behind him and his back to them. "Good of you to come, Totyoalli." He  didn't turn. "Let me take a look at you."

Unafraid, Totyoalli hurried to him. His friends claimed the Revered  Speaker was seven hundred years old, that he'd been emperor when the  Spanish Devil Corteacute;s tried to bring the One World to its knees. Some  said Cuauhtemoc was the War God himself, or maybe the Fifth Sun incarnate, come to Earth to lead the Mexica through a thousand years of  glory. Totyoalli had expected someone very old and wise.

But in fact the Revered Speaker looked hardly out of his teens. He wore  green robes with the sacred day symbols embroidered in gold and silver  thread, and his long black hair was tied back in a complicated knot.  Blue, red, white, and black tattooed lines formed the profile of an  eagle on the right side of his face.

Cuauhtemoc knelt and kissed the earth at Totyoalli's feet, quoting  dedications and blessing him. He then took the boy's head in both hands  and granted him the kiss of Divine Grace on his forehead.

"Now that we have the formalities out of the way, walk with me."  Cuauhtemoc took Totyoalli by the hand and they moved down the hill, past  the egrets, until his mother and father vanished from sight. They sat  on a stone bench under a grove of willow trees. "So, how is calmecac?"

Totyoalli shrugged.

The Revered Speaker's smile widened. "Haven't much interest in studying?"

"I like the learning part, but the other boys say I should go to the  telpochcalli with the rest of the poor kids, and they pick fights."

"You haven't told them you're the Night Wind?"

"Mother told me not to."

Cuauhtemoc nodded. "She's not pleased with your destiny."

Totyoalli shook his head. His mother wished he weren't the Night  Wind; in fact, she'd gone to great lengths to plan a home delivery, so  the priests and government augurs couldn't record the exact time of his  birth. His father had thought her ridiculous, but respected her wishes,  and studied the instructional books to prepare for delivering their baby  himself. No doctor would attend; Totyoalli's mother susp...</itunes:summary>

The Faithful Soldier, Prompted
by Saladin Ahmed

If I die on this piece-of-shit road, Lubnarsquo;s chances die with me. Ali leveled his shotgun at the growling tiger. In the name of God, who needs no credit rating, let me live! Even  when hersquo;d been a soldier, Ali hadnrsquo;t been very religious. But facing  death brought the old invocations to mind. The sway of culture, educated  Lubna would have called it. If she were here. If she could speak.

The creature stood still on the split cement, watching Ali.  Nanohanced tigers had been more or less wiped out in the great hunts  before the Global Credit Crusade, or so Ali had heard. I guess this is the shit end of ldquo;more or less.rdquo; More proof, as if he needed it, that traveling the Old Cairo Road on foot was as good as asking to die.

He almost thought he could hear the creaturersquo;s targeting system whir,  but of course he couldnrsquo;t any more than the tiger could read the  vestigial OS prompt that flashed across Alirsquo;s supposedly deactivated  retscreens.

God willing, Faithful Soldier, you will report for uniform inspection at 0500 hours.

Ali ignored the out-of-date message, kept his gun trained on the creature.

The tiger crouched to spring.

Ali squeezed the trigger, shouted ldquo;God is greater than credit!rdquo;



The cry of a younger man, from the days when hersquo;d let stupid causes use him. The days before hersquo;d met Lubna.

A sputtering spurt of shot sprayed the creature. The tiger roared, bled, and fled.

For a moment Ali just stood there panting. ldquo;Praise be to God,rdquo; he finally said to no one in particular. Irsquo;m coming, beloved. Irsquo;m going to get you your serum, and then Irsquo;m coming home.

A day later, Ali still walked the Old Cairo Road alone, the wind  whipping stinging sand at him, making a mockery of his old army-issued  sandmask. As he walked he thought of homendash;of Free Beirut and his humble  house behind the jade-and-grey-marble fountain. At home a medbed hummed  quietly, keeping Lubna alive even though she lay dying from the Green  Devil, which one side or the otherrsquo;s hover-dustings had infected her  with during the GCC. At home Lubna breathed shallowly while Alirsquo;s  ex-squadmate Fatman Fahrad, the only man in the world he still trusted,  stood watch over her.

Yet Ali had left on this madmanrsquo;s errandndash;left the woman who mattered  more to him than anything on Earthrsquo;s scorched surface. Serum was her  only hope. But serum was devastatingly expensive, and Ali was broke.  Every bit of money he had made working the hover-docks or doing security  for shops had gone to prepay days on Lubnarsquo;s medbed. And there was less  and less work to be had. Hersquo;d begun having dreams that made him wake up  crying. Dreams of shutting down Lubnarsquo;s medbed. Of killing himself.

And then the first strange message had appeared behind his eyes.

Like God-alone-knew how many vets, Alirsquo;s ostensibly inactive OS still garbled forth a glitchy old prompt from time to time

God willing, Faithful Soldier, you will pick up your new field ablution kit after your debriefing today.

God willing, Faithful Soldier, you will spend your leave-time dinars wiselyndash;at Honest Majoudirsquo;s!

But this new message had been unlike anything Ali had ever seen. Blood-freezingly current in its subject matter.

God willing, Faithful Soldier, you will go to the charity-yard of the Western Mosque in Old Cairo. She will live.

Alirsquo;s attention snapped back to the present as the wind picked up and  the air grew thick with san...</itunes:summary>

The Insurance Agent
By Lavie Tidhar

The bar was packed and everyone was watching the Nixon-Reagan match. The fighters were reflected off the barrsquo;s grainy wood countertop and the tablesrsquo; gleaming surfaces and seemed to melt as they flickered down the legs of the scattered chairs. The bar was called the Godhead, which had a lot to do with why I was there. It was a bit of an unfair fight as Reagan was young, pre-presidency, circa-World War Two, while Nixon was heavy-set, older: people were exchanging odds and betting with the barrsquo;s internal gaming system and the general opinion seemed to be that though Reagan was in better shape Nixon was meaner.

I wasnrsquo;t there for the match.

The Godhead was on Pulau Sepanggar, one of the satellite islands off Borneo, hence nominally under Malaysian federal authority but in practice in a free zone that had stronger ties to the Brunei Sultanate. It was a convenient place to meet, providing easy access to the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and, of course, Singapore, which resented the islandrsquo;s role as a growing business centre yet found it useful at the same time.

She wore a smart business suit and a smart communication system that looked like what it was, which was a custom-made gold bracelet on her left arm. She wore smart shades and I was taking a bet that she wasnrsquo;t watching the fight. She was drinking a generic Cola but there was nothing generic about her. I slid into a chair beside her and waited for her shades to turn transparent and notice me.

lsquo;Drink, Mr. Turner?rsquo;



I liked the name Turner. It was Anglo-Saxon generic, a mid-level executiversquo;s name, white as beige. lsquo;Call me James,rsquo; I said. I liked James too. You could tell what a James Turner did just by hearing his name. The rest of me was tailor-made for the name, had been for some time: I had the kind of tan that suggested I had been East for just long enough to have acquired it, black hair that was short but not too short and had a decent but not overly-expensive cut, pale blue eyes behind shades that cost a lot of money to look like a knock-off.

There was a suggestion of a smile in the corners of her mouth and she said, lsquo;I donrsquo;t think I will.rsquo;

lsquo;Mr. Turner, then,rsquo; I said. lsquo;One namersquo;s good as another.rsquo;

lsquo;Quite,rsquo; she said. There was something dismissive in that single word. For the likes of you, was what it implied. lsquo;Thanks,rsquo; I said. lsquo;I think Irsquo;ll have that drink.rsquo;

lsquo;Preference?rsquo; she said.

I said lsquo;Orange juice,rsquo; wanted vodka. She didnrsquo;t say anything, didnrsquo;t have to. A moment later a waiter glided over and deposited the drink on the table, moisture condensing on the outer surface of the manifold that was the glass. I took a sip, put it down again into the ring of water that had immediately formed. Below, Nixon knocked out Reagan in the second round. I heard groans and shouts around me, tried to tune them out.

lsquo;What can I do for you?rsquo; I said.

I couldnrsquo;t quite tell where she was from. She had pale skin carefully kept out of the sun, an Oxford-acquired accent and eyes I couldnrsquo;t see. She said, lsquo;I would like to buy insurance.rsquo;

lsquo;That,rsquo; I said, possibly a little stiffly, lsquo;is why wersquo;re here.rsquo;

lsquo;Quite,rsquo; she said again, and I felt I won the round ndash; she did not like to waste her words and by answering me she had already thrown out six.

lsquo;Is this personal insurance or ndash;?rsquo; I said and she said, a little too quickly, lsquo;Personal.rsquo;

lsquo;Whorsquo;s the IE?rsquo; I said.

She frowned for a moment and I could a...</itunes:summary>

Greetings dear listeners!

I just returned from WorldCon where I met several listeners, thanks to everyone who came by to say hi! I was able to solicit stories from some pros and talk to some authors about their upcoming work - we've got an original piece from James Patrick Kelly coming up that I'm utterly thrilled about. But more on that another month...

The Hugo awards were given out on Saturday, August 20, and the ceremony was a blast. Jay Lake and Ken Scholes  brought their clever rapport to the stage and gave a good show with minimal hiccups (to my eyes, anyway. On Jay's blog he talks about how frantic it was when script pages went missing, etc.) Extra special congrats to Mary Robinette Kowal, who took the prize for Best Short Story (remember you can find "For Want of a Nail" at http://escapepod.org/2011/06/09/ep296-for-want-of-a-nail/ ) and Clarkesworld, the Best Semi-Pro winner that allowed us to use Kate Baker's fantastic narrations in our Hugo month! You can see the other winners at Escape Pod's home page.

Awards always serve to split people. While people covet awards, they still manage to convince themselves that the system is rigged, or undeserving works win, or people band behind their friends to skew the voting. I've read flat-out boring Hugo winners. I've wondered why fantastic stories didn't make even a nomination. I've seen fandom get frothing at the mouth angry over things like websites and podcasts edging into their territory (SF fans afraid of technology and the future. Mind boggling....)

This year the business part of WorldCon featured people that were so mad at last year's Starship Sofa win (and nomination this year, not to mention the excellent Writing Excuses got a nod for Best Related Work) that they decided to create a new category called Best FanCast. While this does show that they are accepting that the podcast is a medium that will not go away, it's somewhat sad that some people are now asking "are there enough podcasts to qualify?"

Head, meet desk.

What really worries me is that all podcasts will be pushed into Best Fancast just because of the medium. Escape Pod publishes stories and is a paying market (qualifying for Best Semi-pro Zine). Starship Sofa publishes stories and nonfic commentary/essays and qualifies (or qualified) for Best Fanzine. James Patrick Kelly's podcast novella Burn is a Nebula winner. Writing Excuses talks about writing and the SF craft, and it's done entirely by pro writers. Would all of these be pushed into the same category because of the podcast element? Why not put Blackout/All Clear, Asimov's, and Chicks Dig Time Lords in the same category because they're all on paper?

I'm not a strong arguer, I admit. It's not in my nature. But I believe I'm going to have to hit the business meetings next year in order to speak up for podcasts, else we'll all be shoved to the kids' table, the one with the rickety leg, just because of our medium instead of our content.

See you in Chicago next year, and at DragonCon this weekend!

Kill Me
by Vylar Kaftan

I'm sitting cross-legged on a rock in west Texas, somewhere north of El Paso, bleeding into the dirt.  The pose feels like a meditation.  I'm fascinated with the knife mark on my left thigh, a shallow slash from hip to knee.  It's surrounded by bruise clusters that look like flowers of broken skin.  In the silent desert, I hear only the soft clicking of the car cooling down.  Then his urine splashes against the rock behind me, and I hear his zipper when he's done.  The night breeze is icy on my back, drying the blood into clots.  He did me well, I admit, glancing up at the full desert moon.  If my body survived--which it wouldn't--I would be scarred, possibly disfigured.  The welts on my back throb like electricity, and everything--the moon, the desert, the wind--is alive with me.

He walks in front of me.  I look up at the man who brought me all the way from Denver.  He looks like a black dog, matted and angry, and growls like one too.  My eyes travel to the cluster of thick hair springing from his shirt neck.  He folds his arms over his chest.

"The night's almost over," I remind him.

He scowls.  "Get in the trunk."

I hesitate--he paid me to do the shy-girl act, a popular one--and he grabs my arm.  He hauls me over the rear bumper into the trunk of his '33 Axis.  He slaps me once across the face--not as hard as I expected--and crumples me into the tight compartment.  He slams the trunk closed, catching my hair in the door.  I try to pull free, but it's no use.  I don't think he meant that part, but he doesn't seem to notice the long trail of hair hanging out of the trunk.  The car door opens and the ignition starts.  I tug on my hair once more and then relax, concentrating on where I hurt, where my body throbs with pain.

As many times as I've done this, I still try to experience it all.  Because it's not every day you experience death.  Only every three months.</itunes:summary>

Soulmates
by Mike Resnick and Lezli Robyn

Have  you ever killed someone you love ndash; I mean, really love?

I  did.

I  did it as surely as if Irsquo;d fired a bullet into her brain, and the  fact that it was perfectly legal, that everyone at the hospital told  me Irsquo;d done a humane thing by giving them permission to pull the plug,  didnrsquo;t make me feel any better. Irsquo;d lived with Kathy for twenty-six  years, been married to her for all but the first ten months. Wersquo;d  been through a lot together: two miscarriages, a bankruptcy, a trial  separation twelve years ago ndash; and then the car crash. They said shersquo;d  be a vegetable, that shersquo;d never think or walk or even move again.  I let her hang on for almost two months, until the insurance started  running out, and then I killed her.



Other  people have made that decision and they learn to live with it. I thought  I could, too. Irsquo;d never been much of a drinker, but I started about  four months after she died. Not much at first, then more every day until  Irsquo;d reach the point, later and later each time, where I couldnrsquo;t  see her face staring up at me anymore.

I  figured it was just a matter of time before I got fired ndash; and you  have to be pretty messed up to be fired as a night watchman at Global  Enterprises. Hell, I didnrsquo;t even know what they made, or at least  not everything they made. There were five large connected buildings,  and a watchman for each. Wersquo;d show up at ten orsquo;clock at night, and  leave when the first shift showed up at seven in the morning ndash; one  man and maybe sixty robots per building.

Yeah,  being sacked was imminent. Problem was, once yoursquo;ve been fired from  a job like this, therersquo;s nothing left but slow starvation. If you  canrsquo;t watch sixty pre-programmed robots and make sure the building  didnrsquo;t blow up, what the hell can you do?

I  still remember the night I met Mose.

I  let the Spy Eye scan my retina and bone structure, and after it let  me in I went directly to the bottle Irsquo;d hidden in the back of the  washroom. By midnight Irsquo;d almost forgotten what Kathy looked like  on that last day ndash; I suppose she looked pretty, like she always did,  but innocent was the word that came to mind ndash; and I was making  my rounds. I knew that Bill Nettles ndash; he was head man on the night  shift ndash; had his suspicions about my drinking and would be checking  up on me, so I made up my mind to ease off the booze a little. But I  had to get rid of Kathyrsquo;s face, so I took one more drink, and then  next thing I knew I was trying to get up off the floor, but my legs  werenrsquo;t working.

I  reached out for something to steady myself, to lean against as I tried  to stand, and what I found was a metal pillar, and a foot away was another  one. Finally my eyes started focusing, and I saw that what I had latched  onto were the titanium legs of a robot that had walked over when it  heard me cursing or singing or whatever the hell I was doing.

ldquo;Get  me on my feet!rdquo; I grated, and two strong metal hands lifted me to  my feet.

ldquo;All  you all right, sir?rdquo; asked the robot in a voice that wasnrsquo;t quite  a mechanical monotone. ldquo;Shall I summon help?rdquo;

rdquo;No!rdquo; I half-snapped, half-shouted. ldquo;No help!rdquo;

ldquo;But  you seem to be in physical distress.rdquo;

ldquo;Irsquo;ll  be fine,rdquo; I said. ldquo;Just help me to my desk, and stay with me for  a few minutes until I sober up.rdquo;

ldquo;I  do not understand the term, sir,rdquo; it said.

ldquo;Donrsquo;t  worry about...</itunes:summary>

Radio nbsp;Nowhere
by Douglas Smith

On the anniversary of the worst night of his life, Liam stood outside the darkened control room of the campus radio station. Over the speakers, the Tragically Hiprsquo;s ldquo;Boots and Heartsrdquo; was just winding down. Behind the glass in the studio, Ziggyrsquo;s small triangular face glowed like some night angel, lit from below by her laptop screen. She looked up, her eyes finding Liamrsquo;s in the darkness. Smiling, she wrinkled her nose at him. His own smile slid away, falling into the dark place inside him, the place that was always darker on this night.

Ziggy turned back to the mike as the song ended. ldquo;Irsquo;m closing with a request from an old friend, to an old friend. This onersquo;s for Jackie, from Liam. A hurtinrsquo; song, cuz hersquo;s still hurtinrsquo;. Fifteen years ago tonighthellip;rdquo; She looked at him through the glass.

Fifteen years. He closed his eyes. Fifteen years, and it still hurt this much.</itunes:summary>

Midnight Blue
by Will McIntosh

Hersquo;d never seen a burgundy before.nbsp; Kim held it in her lap, tapped it with her finger.nbsp; She  was probably tapping it to bring attention to it, and Jeff didnrsquo;t want  to give her the satisfaction of asking to see it, but he really wanted  to see it.nbsp; Burgundy (Kim had insisted on calling it burgundy red when she showed it at show and tell) was a rare one.nbsp; Not as rare as a hot pink Flyer or a viridian Better Looking, but still rare.

A bus roared up, spitting black smoke.nbsp; It was the seven bus--the Linden Court bus, not his.nbsp; Kids rushed to line up in front of the big yellow doors as the bus hissed to a stop.nbsp; A second-grader squealed, shoved a bigger kid with her Partridge Family lunch box because hersquo;d stepped on her foot.nbsp; All the younger kids seemed to have Partridge Family lunch boxes this year.

ldquo;What did you say it did when yoursquo;ve got all three pieces of the charm together?rdquo; nbsp;Jeff asked Kim.nbsp; He said it casually, like he was just making conversation until his bus came.

ldquo;It relaxes time,rdquo; Kim said.nbsp; ldquo;When yoursquo;re bored you can make time pass quickly, and when yoursquo;re having fun you can make time stretch out.rdquo;

Jeff nodded, tried to look just interested enough to be polite, but no more.nbsp; What must that be like, to make the hour at church fly by?nbsp; Or make the school day (except for lunch and recess) pass in an eyeblink? nbsp;Jeff wondered how fast or slow you could move things along.nbsp; Could you make it seem like you were eating an ice cream sandwich for six hours?nbsp; That would be sparkling fine.

ldquo;Want to see it?rdquo; Kim asked.

ldquo;Okay,rdquo; Jeff said, holding out his hands too eagerly before he remembered himself.nbsp; Kim handed it to him, looking pleased with herself, the dimples on her round face getting a little deeper.

It was smooth as marble, perfectly round, big as a grapefruit and heavy as a bowling ball.nbsp; It made Jeffrsquo;s heart hammer to hold it.nbsp; The  rich red, which hinted at purple while still being certainly red, was  so beautiful it seemed impossible, so vivid it made his blue shirt seem  like a Polaroid photo left in the sun too long.

ldquo;Imagine finding this in the wild?nbsp; Pushing over a dead tree and seeing it sitting there under the root?rdquo; Jeff said.



ldquo;Yeah, right,rdquo; Kim said.nbsp; ldquo;Not likely.rdquo;nbsp; She shook her long brown hair back over her shoulder.nbsp; She did that all day long in class.nbsp; She thought she was so gorgeous.

A few of the other kids circled around to take a look.nbsp; Jeff  spun it around until he found the hole where it would be fitted to one  side of the staff, when someone got the whole charm together.

ldquo;Will  your father try to get the other two pieces, do you think?rdquo; Ricky Adamo  asked, reaching to pet it once, probably just so he could say hersquo;d  touched one.

ldquo;Hersquo;s  only keeping this as an investment,rdquo; Kim said, holding out her hands to  take it back from Jeff, who passed it over, his fingers suddenly  feeling much too light.nbsp; ldquo;My fatherrsquo;s going to buy me a whole chartreuse to absorb when Irsquo;m 18.nbsp; Irsquo;m going to be a doctor.rdquo;

ldquo;He is not,rdquo; Jeff said.nbsp; ldquo;Most of the chartreuse ones thatrsquo;ve been found have already been absorbed.nbsp; The ones that havenrsquo;t, your father would have to give your whole house and everything in it just to get one sphere.rdquo;

ldquo;What would you know about it?rdquo; Kim said, glaring.nbsp; ldquo;You donrsquo;t even know what it feels like to absorb one!nbsp; Yoursquo;ve probably never even owned a sphere, let alone absorbed a whole charm...</itunes:summary>

Union Dues: Sidekicks in Stockholm
by Jeffrey R. DeRego

Five of them at least, with submachine guns, body armor, and more dynamite than I've seen outside a Tom and Jerry cartoon. They all sound the same thanks to some digital vocal thing built into their black suits. They all look the same with black ski masks underneath a mesh sort of fencing helmet, black everything else right to the boots, and all about the same size, like someone took a picture of a terrorist and photocopied it.

This whole drama seems like it began a million years ago by now. I was scheduled to come here and open a convention of business leaders and up-and-coming corporate types. My speech, Good Corporate Citizenship, with examples of how The Union gives back to the communities it serves, is a two year old piece worked up and updated by Marketing and Promotions to accommodate a new administration in Washington, and some new economic stuff that I don't really understand. I'd delivered only half of the text before these guys burst through the door.


I froze at the first gunshot, not for long, just a few seconds, just long enough to be useless.

The girl who sits beside me ndash; her name tag reads "Hello my name is Stacy" ndash; leans in close. She whispers, "What are you going to do, Adam?"
I try and ignore her and watch the men. My wrist feels weirdly cool and light without the communicator gauntlet and beacon strapped around it. I glance down at my gloves and the tatters of honeycombed teflon-spandex straps where the gauntlet was stitched on. You're Adam Smasher! Goddamn it. Do something! I've only been in the orange suit and cape for three years. I had the physique and the right chin at the right time and until about and hour ago thought the role fit pretty well.

My predecessor died of a heart attack in the New York Pyramid training room two days after his thirtieth birthday, the original Adam Smasher sits connected to a mechanical heart pump in The Village somewhere in Antarctica. He's the Adam Smasher everyone remembers from Saturday-morning TV, blonde and chiseled, his orange one piece suit and mask almost glowing, his tritium atom insignia a mark of galactic strength as he caught speeding, robber-filled cars, fought off robots and gangsters and the evil machinations of Dr. Destruction. Don't get me wrong, when people talk to me, they talk to Adam Smasher, but sometimes I want to scream out, "I used to watch 'The Adventures of Adam Smasher' on TV too, in syndication!"

I should be thankful anyone remembers the show at all.

Atom Comics' teen and adult readers have moved on to darker, grittier titles by competing publishers and, well, look at me? I'm like a smiling Day-Glo orange tree. The kid demographic wants the crazy soap opera stuff like Team Shikaragaki not a creaky old walking ethics lesson. So, The Union pulls Adam Smasher comics. My figure goes into the much less produced "classics" line. No playsets. No video game adaptations. No TV. Meanwhile, I wait for Marketing and Promotions to generate interest in Adam Smasher. Maybe I come back darker, or kiddier, or something completely different. Until then, my whole life is giving lectures about doing the right thing and leveraging the audience's nostalgia for a true-blue ndash; well, orange ndash; Union Superhero.

"Adam, how are you going to get us out of this?" Stacy is maybe twenty five. Blue eyed, petite ndash; but then, everyone looks sort of petite to me as I'm just scraping seven-foot-three tall and thirty nine inches across the shoulders ndash; every time she looks at the terrorists her eyes widen with fear, and every time she looks at me they widen more, with hope.

I try not to look at he...</itunes:summary>

Hey folksmdash;

Short editorrsquo;s note this month to make sure this goes out reasonably on time to all you faithful listeners. Er, readers.

Last month saw a bit of mopping-up action on the various nominees with Stone Wall Truth, which got nominated in the novella category for the Nebula, and the space-piratical Leech Run.

But most importantly, we hit Episode 300 of the podcast that Steve built with Tim Prattrsquo;s We Go Back. Who Escape Pod goes pretty far back with. His stories are episodes 8, 31 (with Greg van Eekhout), 67, 105, 142, 190, 239, 251 and 276. Hersquo;s probably far and away the Escape Pod fan favorite, and Impossible Dreams is still the story I usually recommend as the entry point for new Escape Pod listeners.

Itrsquo;s been a little over a year since Mur took over and I snuck in through an open side Escape Pod airlock (for closed values of open). Wersquo;re still adrift in space, same as it ever was, floating along scanning for the next story, and eventually a planet to set down on. Like many fiction journeys, the path laid out at the beginning is not the path you end up going down, because that would be boring.

Until the next,






mdash;Bill

Leech Run
by Scott W. Baker

The inhabitants of Galileo Station parted as Titan moved among them.  Not one made eye contact, but all gawked furtively.  One of Titan's dark eyes glared back down at the throng; the other eye remained hidden behind a curtain of stark white hair.  Conspicuous appearance was his curse.  What bystander would forget a snow-capped mountain of dark muscle?  Memorability was not an asset for someone like him.

One body in the crowd moved toward Titan rather than away.  "The passengers is aboard, love," the man said.

"Reif, call me 'love' in public and you'll find yourself very uncomfortable."  Titan lowered his voice so it stayed within the wide berth granted by the populace.  "How many passengers?"

"Thirty-two, lo -- Captain."

Titan shook his head.  "Hemingway promised fifty."

"If Hem flew so bad as he scored cargo--"

"Any load of leeches will turn a profit," Titan assured the mechanic.  "But small load doesn't mean small risk.  I want you sharp."

"As ever, love."

They continued through the bustling station to their ship, a little cargo runner designed for intra-system transport at sub-light speeds.  Of course, a mechanic of Reif's skill could make a ship reach speeds its designers never fathomed.

Such deviant engineering demanded a pilot with a select set of skills and dubious moral character.  Hemingway possessed both.  He was waiting for them beside the ship with his ever-present, boastful grin.

"I said there be takers on Galileo, didn't I?" Hemingway said as his crewmates entered earshot.  "I done already told them the rules."

Titan's brow furrowed.  "Thirty-two?  Don't dislocate anything patting yourself on the back.  And there's just one rule on my ship."

Titan brushed past his pilot into the cargo hold.  It was a small hold, even for an intra-system runner, but it hadn't always been so.  Reif's touch here made for ideal leech transport.  The customized hold maintained a six-foot buffer from all electrical systems, enough of a gap that even a class-three leech couldn't siphon a single ampere.  Despite his extensive precautions, Titan always felt uneasy with such capricious cargo.


Titan surveyed the passengers perched shoulder to shoulder on the plank benches that were bolted to the hold's bare metal floor.  Leeches, every last one of them.  They didn't look dangerous.  On a ship in deep space, they could be as lethal as any weapon.

Aside from passengers and benches, the hold was barren: no amenities, no restraints, no personal possessions, no plumbing.  These thirty-two leeches would spend the next two weeks in this metal tank.  No normal human would accept such accommodations.  Why should they when a starliner would take them all the way to Kilroth for a couple hundred cred?  This kind of travel was for people the liners would never touch.  Alpha System law guaranteed anyone foolish enough to transport a leech would spend the rest of his life laboring on a prison planet -- one too close to a sun for a proper settlement but too mineral-rich to resist exploiting.  Such labor colonies' conditions were enough to make one envy the leeches' sentences; they were simply shot on sight.

Of course Alpha was a big system, difficult to monitor.  A captain could make a few thousand cred smuggling a leech between planets.  Carrying them all the way to a friendlier system, as Titan did, could net a small fortune.  Titan demanded twenty grand a head.  Alpha's policies on leech-genocide made the price a bargain.

"There is only one rule on my ship," Titan announced again, this time to his hold full of human contraband, "no one leaves the hold."  He walked along the </itunes:summary>

Stone Wall Truth
by Caroline M. Yoachim

Njeri sewed the woman together with hairs from a zebra tail.  Her deer-bone needle dipped under the womanrsquo;s skin and bobbed back out.  The contrast of the white seams against her dark skin was striking.

ldquo;The center seam makes a straight line,rdquo; Njeri told her apprentice, ldquo;but the others flow with the natural curves of the body, just as the Enshai River follows the curve of the landscape.rdquo;

Odion leaned in to examine her work, his breath warm on the back of her neck.  Foolish boy, wasting his attention on her.  Njeri set her needle on the table and stood up to stretch.  The job was nearly done -- shersquo;d repositioned the womanrsquo;s organs, reconstructed her muscles, sewn her body back together.  Only the face was still open, facial muscles splayed out in all directions from the womanrsquo;s skull like an exotic flower in full bloom.

ldquo;Why sew them back together, after the wall?rdquo; Odion asked.  ldquo;Why not let them die?rdquo;



Njeri sighed.  The boy had steady hands and a sharp mind, but his heart was unforgiving.  He had been eager to learn about the cutting, about the delicate art of preparing a patient to hang from the wall.  What he questioned was the sewing, the part of the work that had drawn Njeri to this calling.  She studied the woman on the table -- the last surviving grandchild of Radmalende, who had been king when the country was ruled by kings instead of warlords.  The two of them had come of age the same spring, and had taken their adulthood rites together.  That had been many years ago, but it was hard for Njeri not to think of her childhood friend by name.  ldquo;You think I should leave her to die?rdquo;

ldquo;Her bones were black as obsidian.rdquo;  He traced the center seam with his finger.

Njeri said nothing.  She admired the woman for her strength; she hadnrsquo;t cried or protested or made excuses.  Few women were put on the wall, but this one had faced it as bravely as any man, braver than some.  And her shadowself had been like nothing Njeri had ever seen.  Dark, of course, but a tightly controlled blackness, an army of ants marching out from her heart and along her bones.  A constantly shifting shadow that never rested too long in any one place.

ldquo;She made a play for the throne.  Killed six Maiwatu guardsmen in the process.  Her attack has opened the way for the Upyatu.  I heard a rumor today the capitol is still under siege.rdquo;  Odion masked the worry in his voice, but Njeri knew he was concerned.  He had many friends in the upper echelons of the ruling class -- it was how he came to be apprenticed to the highest ranking surgeon at the longest stretch of wall.

ldquo;There is always unrest in the capitol.rdquo;  Njeri didnrsquo;t add that this woman had a stronger claim to the citrine throne than most.  ldquo;Besides, itrsquo;s not our place to say what people deserve.  General Bahtir pays us to take people apart and put them back together, not to judge them.rdquo;

Njeri nudged Odion aside.  She settled back into her stool, and he went outside to set some water boiling for tea.  He didnrsquo;t appreciate being pushed away, didnrsquo;t understand why she didnrsquo;t want him the way he wanted her.  She wanted to tell the boy to find someone his own age, someone who liked boys, but Odion wouldnrsquo;t listen.  Njeri returned to her work.  The womanrsquo;s jawbone hung slack below her skull, but her mouth still closed around the clear stone that held her mind while Njeri patched her body together.  The womanrsquo;s eyes stared up at the thatched straw roof, empty, with nothing but bone surround...</itunes:summary>

Episode 300! Wow!

We Go Back
Tim Pratt

My best friend Jenny Kay climbed in through my window and nearly stepped on my head. If I'd been sleeping a foot closer to the wall, I would've gotten a face full of her boot, but instead I just snapped awake and said "What who what now?" and blinked a lot.

"Oh damn," Jenny said in a loudish whisper. "When did you move your bed under the window?"

"Last week," I said, sitting up in bed. "I wanted a change." If you can't rearrange your life, you can at least rearrange yourself, and if your mom won't let you dye your hair blue, you can make do with rearranging your rooms.

Jenny Kay dropped from standing to sitting in one motion, making my mattress bounce, and landed cross-legged and totally comfortable. "Hey," she said. "So I need to borrow your ring." I couldn't read her expression in the dim moonlight from the window.

I looked at my right hand, where a thin silver ring looped my index finger, catching what light there was in the room and giving back twinkles. The metal grew cold against my skin and tightened a fraction, almost a friendly little squeeze. The ring -- which wasn't really a ring -- could tell when I was thinking about it. "Uh," I said.

Jenny nodded vigorously, a motion I felt in the jostling of the mattress more than I saw. "I know! I know. But I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important. I mean, you've had the thing for more than a year, and I've never asked once if I could use it, right?"

I glanced at my closed door -- no glow under the crack at the bottom, which meant my parents had gone to their separate beds and turned out the hall light -- and switched on my bedside lamp. Jenny was dressed in jeans and a sweater, all in dark grays and blacks, not her usual aggressively flamboyant colorful mishmash style at all. Good for sneaking into people's windows, I guessed.

I sat up against the headboard, because when you're about to annoy your best friend, it's better not to be flat on your back at the time. "I wish I could," I said -- not one hundred percent true, but Jenny was a fourteen-year-old genius, not a human lie detector. "But it's, like... part of me. You know? I'm part of the mechanism. I can't just take it off. It's linked into my, what's it called, socratic nervous system?"

"Somatic," Jenny said gloomily. She was almost as good at biology as she was at math. "The part of your nervous system that controls movement, which sort of halfway makes sense, I guess."

I shrugged. "So, there you go. The ring's not something I wear. It's something that wears me.  Or we wear each other. What did you want it for?"



She looked away. "Nothing. An errand."

I sighed. "Tell me, Jay Kay. Maybe I can help. Is it about a boy?"

Jenny just bit her lip. Good enough. The past few months it's pretty much always been about a boy.

I took her hand. Me and Jenny go way back, and whenever I say that, older people laugh, because I'm fifteen and she's fourteen, and they're like, you're too young to even have a "way back." But I've known Jenny since she skipped first grade and ended up in my second-grade class, which means I've been her best friend for about half my life, and how many of you old people have a friendship with that kind of percentage? She used to hide me in her basement when things got too bad and I ran away from home, and she's the reason I've never failed a math or science class. I owe her. I'm not saying I'd kill for her or anything, but I mean, I like to think I'd help her bury the bodies.

"Okay," I said. "I'll help. Where are we going?"

"I don't want to get you into any trouble," she said. "It's my problem, I should really deal with it myself."

I shrugged. "Mom stopped doing the middle-of-the-night spot checks mo</itunes:summary>

This month wersquo;re bringing you short story and novella nominees for the Hugo awards, one of the two big Science Fiction and Fantasy awards alongside the Nebula. The Nebulas are awarded by members of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, and the Hugos by the attendees of Worldcon. The Nebularsquo;s were awarded in May, and wersquo;ll find out who wins the Hugos next month at Renovation in Reno, Nevada.

Itrsquo;s always been more than a bit amusing to me to see the inevitable lsquo;That got nominated? The [insert award name] is losing itrsquo; comments cropping up on our forums and elsewhere. As if the Nebulas and Hugos are awarded by some wise men up on the crags, parsing the yearrsquo;s crop of stories against the awardrsquo;s prior canon. The nominations and awards come from a large swath of fandom or onersquo;s fellow writers, and therersquo;s always going to be elements of friendship, politics, fervent loyalty, and emotion in these endeavors.

And yet, the nominating crowds for both pick stories that are good, and worth reading. You wonrsquo;t like all of them, but yoursquo;ll like a lot of them, and that is really the best you can hope for. Fiction is not nearly so varied as fiction readers, and the point of these things is to make sure good stories get the biggest audience then can.

Which is also the point of Soundproof. People write into us about having friends that canrsquo;t stand hearing stories, or who have a deaf spouse, or they just prefer to read.

The point of Escape Pod is getting as many good stories out to as many ears and eyes (or fingers, if anyonersquo;s feeding this into one of those Braille boxes) as possible, which is why wersquo;ve worked hard to keep things free, taking advertising when we like the advertiser, and being ever thankful to those of you who donate. We couldnrsquo;t do it without you. (Which is why Dave Thompson and Wilson Fowlie have been working hard to bring those who donate the Alphabet Quartet as a thank you.)

Hopefully one of the Hugo nominees in this issue will get the shiny, shiny rocket ship next month. Theyrsquo;re all worthy of it, even if they are [insert ghastly sub-genre].

By James Patrick Kelly

Everything changed once Beep found out that Mariskarsquo;s mother was the famous Natalya Volochkova.nbsp;nbsp; Mariskarsquo;s life aboard the Shining Legend went immediately from bad to awful.nbsp; Even before he singled her out, she had decided that there was no way shersquo;d be spending the rest of her teen years crewing on an asteroid bucket.nbsp; Once Beep started persecuting her, she began counting down the remaining days of the run as if she were a prisoner.nbsp; She tried explaining that she had no use for Natalya Volochkova, who had never been much of a mother to her, but Beep wouldnrsquo;t hear it.nbsp; He didnrsquo;t care that Mariska had only signed on to the Shining Legend to get back at her mother for ruining her life.

Somehow that hadnrsquo;t worked out quite the way she had planned.

For example, there was crud duty.nbsp; With a twisting push Mariska sailed into the command module, caught herself on a handrail, and launched toward the starboard wall.nbsp; The racks ofnbsp; instrument screens chirped and beeped and buzzed; command was one of the loudest mods on the ship.nbsp; She stuck her landing in front of navigation rack and her slippers caught on the deck burrs, anchoring her in the shiprsquo;snbsp; .0006 gravity.nbsp;nbsp; Sure enough, she could see new smears of mold growing from the crack where the nav screen fit into the wall.nbsp; This was Beeprsquo;s fault, although he would never admit it.nbsp; He kept the humidity jacked up in Command, said that dry air gave him nosebleeds.nbsp; Richard FiveFord claimed they came from all the drugs Beep sniffed but Mariska didnrsquo;t want to believe that.nbsp; Also Beep liked to sip his coffee from a cup instead sucking it out of a bag, even though he slopped all the time.nbsp; Fungi loved the sugary spatters.nbsp; She sniffed one particularly vile looking smear of mold.nbsp; It smelled faintly like the worms she used to grow back home on the Moon.nbsp; She wiped her nose with the sleeve of her jersey and reached to the holster on her belt for her sponge. As she scrubbed, the bitter vinegar tang of disinfectant gel filled the mod.nbsp; Not for the first time, she told herself that this job stunk.

She felt the tingle of Richard FiveFord offering a mindfeed and opened her head.nbsp; =What?=

His feed made a pleasant fizz behind her eyes, distracting her. =You done any time soon?=nbsp; Distraction was Richardrsquo;s specialty

=No.=

=Didit is making a dream for us.=



She slapped her sponge at the wall in frustration.nbsp; =This sucks.=nbsp; Mariska couldnrsquo;t remember the last time Didit or Richard FiveFord had pulled crud duty.

=Should we wait for you?=

=If you want.=nbsp; But she knew they wouldnrsquo;t. =Might be another hour.=

ldquo;Yoursquo;re working, Volochkova.rdquo; Beeprsquo;s voice crackled over the loudspeaker.nbsp; One of his quirks was snooping their private feeds and then yelling at them over the shiprsquo;s com.

ldquo;Yes, sir,rdquo; she said.nbsp; Beep liked to be called sir.nbsp; It made him feel like the captain of the Shining Legend instead of senior monkey of its maintenance crew.

ldquo;Shersquo;s working, FiveFord.nbsp; Leave our sweet young thing alone.rdquo;

She felt Richardrsquo;s feed pop like a bubble.nbsp; He was more afraid of Beep than she was even though the old crank hardly ever bullied Richard.nbsp; Mariska hated being called sweet young thing.nbsp; She wasnrsquo;t sweet and she wasnrsquo;t all that young.nbsp; She was already fifteen in conscious years, eighteen if you counted the time she had hibernated.

When Mariska finished wiping th...</itunes:summary>

The Things
By Peter Watts

I am being Blair. I escape out the back as the world comes in through the front.

I am being Copper. I am rising from the dead.

I am being Childs. I am guarding the main entrance.

The names don't matter. They are placeholders, nothing more; all biomass is interchangeable. What matters is that these are all that is left of me. The world has burned everything else.

I see myself through the window, loping through the storm, wearing Blair. nbsp;MacReady has told me to burn Blair if he comes back alone, but MacReady still thinks I am one of him. I am not: I am being Blair, and I am at the door. I am being Childs, and I let myself in. I take brief communion, tendrils writhing forth from my faces, intertwining: I am BlairChilds, exchanging news of the world.

The world has found me out. It has discovered my burrow beneath the tool shed, the half-finished lifeboat cannibalized from the viscera of dead helicopters. The world is busy destroying my means of escape. Then it will come back for me.

There is only one option left. I disintegrate. Being Blair, I go to share the plan with Copper and to feed on the rotting biomass once called  Clarke ; so many changes in so short a time have dangerously depleted my reserves. Being Childs, I have already consumed what was left of Fuchs and am replenished for the next phase. nbsp;I sling the flamethrower onto my back and head outside, into the long Antarctic night.

I will go into the storm, and never come back.

#

I was so much more, before the crash. I was an explorer, an ambassador, a missionary. I spread across the cosmos, met countless worlds, took communion: the fit reshaped the unfit and the whole universe bootstrapped upwards in joyful, infinitesimal increments. I was a soldier, at war with entropy itself. I was the very hand by which Creation perfects itself.

So much wisdom I had. So much experience. Now I cannot remember all the things I knew. I can only remember that I once knew them.

I remember the crash, though. It killed most of this offshoot outright, but a little crawled from the wreckage: a few trillion cells, a soul too weak to keep them in check. Mutinous biomass sloughed off despite my most desperate attempts to hold myself together: panic-stricken little clots of meat, instinctively growing whatever limbs they could remember and fleeing across the burning ice. By the time I'd regained control of what was left the fires had died and the cold was closing back in. I barely managed to grow enough antifreeze to keep my cells from bursting before the ice took me.

I remember my reawakening, too: dull stirrings of sensation in real time, the first embers of cognition, the slow blooming warmth of awareness as body and soul embraced after their long sleep. I remember the biped offshoots surrounding me, the strange chittering sounds they made, the odd  uniformity  of their body plans. How ill-adapted they looked! How  inefficient  their morphology! Even disabled, I could see so many things to fix. So I reached out. I took communion. I tasted the flesh of the worldmdash;

mdash;and the world attacked me. It  attacked  me.

I left that place in ruins. It was on the other side of the mountainsmdash;the  Norwegian camp , it is called heremdash;and I could never have crossed that distance in a biped skin. Fortunately there was another shape to choose from, smaller than the biped but better adapted to the local climate. I hid within it while the rest of me fought off the attack. I fled into the night on four legs, and let the rising flames cover my escape.

I did not stop running until I...</itunes:summary>

Amaryllis
By Carrie Vaughn

I never knew my mother, and I never understood why she did what she did. I ought to be grateful that she was crazy enough to cut out her implant so she could get pregnant. But it also meant she was crazy enough to hide the pregnancy until termination wasnrsquo;t an option, knowing the whole time that shersquo;d never get to keep the baby. That shersquo;d lose everything. That her household would lose everything because of her.

I never understood how she couldnrsquo;t care. I wondered what her family thought when they learned what shersquo;d done, when their committee split up the household, scattered themmdash;broke them, because of her.

Did she think I was worth it?
#

It was all about quotas.

ldquo;Theyrsquo;re using cages up north, I heard. Off shore, anchored,rdquo; Nina said. ldquo;Fifty feet acrossmdash;twice as much protein grown with half the resources, and wersquo;d never have to touch the wild population again. We could double our quota.rdquo;

I hadnrsquo;t really been listening to her. We were resting, just for a moment; she sat with me on the railing at the prow of Amaryllis and talked about her big plans.

Wind pulled the sails taut and the fiberglass hull cut through waves without a sound, we sailed so smooth. Garrett and Sun hauled up the nets behind us, dragging in the catch. Amaryllis was elegant, a 30-foot sleek vessel with just enough cabin and cargo spacemdash;an antique but more than seaworthy. She was a good boat, with a good crew. The best.

ldquo;Mariemdash;rdquo; Nina said, pleading.

I sighed and woke up. ldquo;Wersquo;ve been over this. We canrsquo;t just double our quota.rdquo;

ldquo;But if we got authorizationmdash;rdquo;

ldquo;Donrsquo;t you think wersquo;re doing all right as it is?rdquo; We had a good crewmdash;we were well fed and not exceeding our quotas; I thought wersquo;d be best off not screwing all that up. Not making waves, so to speak.

Ninarsquo;s big brown eyes filled with tearsmdash;Irsquo;d said the wrong thing, because I knew what she was really after, and the status quo wasnrsquo;t it.

ldquo;Thatrsquo;s just it,rdquo; she said. ldquo;Wersquo;ve met our quotas and kept everyone healthy for years now. I really think we should try. We can at least ask, canrsquo;t we?rdquo;

The truth was: No, I wasnrsquo;t sure we deserved it. I wasnrsquo;t sure that kind of responsibility would be worth it. I didnrsquo;t want the prestige. Nina didnrsquo;t even want the prestigemdash;she just wanted the baby.

ldquo;Itrsquo;s out of our hands at any rate,rdquo; I said, looking away because I couldnrsquo;t bear the intensity of her expression.

Pushing herself off the rail, Nina stomped down Amaryllisrsquo; port side to join the rest of the crew hauling in the catch. She wasnrsquo;t old enough to want a baby. She was lithe, fit, and golden, running barefoot on the deck, sun-bleached streaks gleaming in her brown hair. Actually, no, she was old enough. Shersquo;d been with the house for seven yearsmdash;she was twenty, now. It hadnrsquo;t seemed so long.

ldquo;Whoa!rdquo; Sun called. There was a splash and a thud as something in the net kicked against the hull. He leaned over the side, the muscles along his broad, coppery back flexing as he clung to a net that was about to slide back into the water. Nina, petite next to his strong frame, reached with him. I ran down and grabbed them by the waistbands of their trousers to hold them steady. The fourth of our crew, Garrett, latched a boat hook into the net. Together we hauled the catch onto the deck. Wersquo;d caught something big, heavy, and full of powerful muscles.

For Want of a Nail
By Mary Robinette Kowal

With one hand, Rava adjusted the VR interface glasses where they bit into the bridge of her nose, while she kept her other hand buried in Cordeliarsquo;s innards. There was scant room to get the flexible shaft of a mono-lens and her hand through the access hatch in the AIrsquo;s chassis. From the next compartment, drums and laughter bled through the plastic walls of the ship, indicating her sisterrsquo;s conception party was still in full swing.

With only a single camera attached, the interface glasses didnrsquo;t give Rava depth perception as she struggled to replug the transmitter cable. The chassis had not been designed to need repair. At all. It had been designed to last hundreds of years without an upgrade.

If Rava couldnrsquo;t get the cable plugged in and working, Cordelia wouldnrsquo;t be able to download backups of herself to her long-term memory. She couldnrsquo;t store more than a week at a time in active memory. It would be the same as a slow death sentence.

The square head of the cable slipped out of Ravarsquo;s fingers. Again. ldquo;Dammit!rdquo; She slammed her heel against the shiprsquo;s floor in frustration.

ldquo;If you canrsquo;t do it, let someone else try.rdquo; Her older brother, Ludoviko, had insisted on following her out of the party as if he could help.

ldquo;You know, this would go a lot faster if you werenrsquo;t breathing down my neck.rdquo;

ldquo;You know, you wouldnrsquo;t be doing this at all if you hadnrsquo;t dropped her.rdquo;



Rava resisted the urge to pull the mono-lens out of the jack in her glasses and glare at him. He might have gotten better marks in school, but she was the AIrsquo;s wrangler. ldquo;Why donrsquo;t you go back to the party and see if you can learn something about fertility?rdquo; She lifted the cable head and tried one more time.

ldquo;Why, you littlemdash;rdquo; Rage choked his voice, more than she had expected from a random slam. She made a guess that his appeal to the repro-council didnrsquo;t go well.

Cordeliarsquo;s voice cut in, stopping what he was going to say. ldquo;Itrsquo;s not Ravarsquo;s fault. I did ask her to pick me up.rdquo;

ldquo;Yeah.rdquo; Rava focused on the cable, trying to get it aligned.

ldquo;Right.rdquo; Ludoviko snorted. ldquo;And then you dropped yourself.rdquo;

Cordelia sighed and Rava could almost imagine breath tickling her skin. ldquo;If yoursquo;re going to blame anyone, blame Branson Conchord for running into her.rdquo;

Rava didnrsquo;t bother answering. Theyrsquo;d been having the same conversation for the last hour and Cordelia should know darn well what Ludovikorsquo;s answer would be.

Like programming, he said, ldquo;It was irresponsible. She should have said no. The room was full of intoxicated, rowdy people and you are too valuable an asset.rdquo;

Rava rested her head against the smooth wood side of the AIrsquo;s chassis and closed her eyes, ignoring her brother and the flat picture in her goggles. Her fingers rolled the slick plastic head of the cable, building a picture in her mind of the white square and the flat gold cord stretching from it. She slid the cable forward until it jarred against the socket. Rotating the head, Rava focused all her attention on the tiny clues of friction vibrating up her arm. This was a simple, comprehensible problem.

She didnrsquo;t want to think about what would happen if she couldnrsquo;t repair the damage.

Being unable to download her old memories meant Cordelia would have to delete herself bit by bit to keep functioning. All because Rava had asked if she wanted to dance. At least Ludoviko hadnrsquo;t heard that part...</itunes:summary>

We kept in touch through the war, when he messaged me about marching through upstate New York.  He always started the same way:  "Dear Ryan, Please come kick my commanding officer in the balls."  Then he'd tell me about the latest mess--cracks in their radiation suits, or toxic waterholes that were supposed to be clear.  He never got in trouble for the messages; they needed him too badly.  My epilepsy disqualified me from the draft, which probably saved my life.  Pretty boys like me weren't exactly Army material.  By the time things were bad enough that they needed any warm body, there wasn't enough human government left to organize a draft.

The ruins at Binghamton were where Trey got sick.  By the time I got across the country to him, he'd recovered--well, as much as possible.  I remember the doctor's face as he says Trey will live, but he'll be in pain.</itunes:summary>

Hello Gentle Listenersmdash;

May brought us the announcement of the Hugo Awards nominees, which means that June is Hugo Month! For years, Escape Pod has been buying the rights to most of the Hugo short story nominees, and this year is no different. Wersquo;ll be featuring three of the four nominees, and since June has five Thursdays, we will also be featuring two longer stories that got Nebula and/or Hugo nods!

We also have the ebook rights to the stories, which is an Escape Pod first, so next monthrsquo;s Soundproof will be a collectorrsquo;s item. (If a digital file could be collectible. Which it canrsquo;t. So never mind. But you know what I mean; itrsquo;ll be cool.) Irsquo;m very excited to see our site growing so much.

We want to send extra special congrats to the podcasts who managed to make it onto the Hugo Ballot this year! 2010 winner for Best Fanzine, Starship Sofa, has gotten another nomination, and Writing Excuses has received a nod for Best Related Work. SSS has wonderful stories from many masters of SF, and Writing Excuses has wonderful discussions on how to write genre fiction. We are thrilled that these quality podcasts are getting attention from fandom. Irsquo;ll be reporting from WorldCon in two and a half months, and liveblogging the Hugo Awards. More info soon!

A question we get a lot of is, ldquo;Why do you not have all the stories in your PDF?rdquo; The answer is simple- audio and ebook rights are purchased separately, and sometimes an author cannot or will not grant us both rights. Or there are stories wersquo;ve purchased before we started purchasing ebook rights, so we have no right to give you text versions of the stories. We take our authorsrsquo; rights very seriously and will only release the format for which we have rights. Audio-only stories are fewer and fewer these days, but there still will be an occasional one in our future feed.

Speaking of the feed, some people have asked that the Soundproof Escape Pod have its own feed, or the audio have its own feed. Or the R stories to have their own feed. We get this question a lot and canrsquo;t really create custom feeds for each listener - but never fear, there is a solution. Irsquo;d like to point you to a page that gives you some RSS options, including some things you can do to custom make your own EP feed.

From How To Subscribe (http://escapepod.org/subscribe/):

You can make your own special Escape Pod feed by subscribing to http://www.escapepod.org/category/XXXX/feed where you replace XXXX with the category you want to subscribe to. Categories are listed on the front page in a drop-down box on the right. Have at it!

Lastly, in order to get the submissions under control, wersquo;re taking two months off and closing for submissions on June 6th.

We hope you enjoy this issue, chock full of awesome stories, reviews, and Nebula reporting. We hope you have a wonderful summer (or winter, if yoursquo;re on the other side of the world) and keep listening! We will have other announcements next month!

		<itunes:summary>From Dave Thompson, the co-editor at our sister podcast, Podcastle:
In late 2007, I took a trip down to San Diego's Conjecture convention. I'd been listening to Escape Pod for a couple of years (PodCastle hadn't even started yet) and so I was thrilled that the very first panel I got to see featured Tim Pratt, Heather Shaw, and Greg van Eekhout. Tim had just won a Hugo for his story "Impossible Dreams" (which I first heard at Escape Pod, yo!) and proceeded to do a collaborative reading of ABC flash fiction. Essentially, they divvied up the alphabet, wrote flash fiction stories for each letter, such as "E is for Excrement" and "N is for Nevermore Nevermore Land." It was a fantastic reading - hilarious, poignant, thrilling, and most of all - they knew how to have fun. I left the convention knowing, just knowing, that one day - this ABC book was going to be big.

But nothing happened. Several years passed, and still - nothing happened.

And then, toward the end of last year - I realized, I'm at Escape Artists, co-editing PodCastle, and that awesome book I remember? Is out there still, and nobody's heard it. So, I talked to Ben Phillips, and then I talked to Tim, Heather, Greg, and Jenn Reese - who came aboard to help them finish up the collection - and we came up with a plan. I decided it'd be awesome to send the Alphabet Quartet out to listeners who'd been kind enough to sign up as paid subscribers or make a one-time donation to us of $50 or more since January 1, 2011. Times are tough, we know, and not everyone can donate, so all the Escape Artists podcasts are going to be sharing a few of these stories with everyone who wants them (and also at the Drabblecast). Additionally, all the stories are available to read there for free at Daily Science Fiction, a great new online magazine that emails you free SF/F stories daily, so everyone wins. Thanks for listening, and we hope you enjoy the extra stories.</itunes:summary>

The Night Train
By Lavie Tidhar

Her name wasn't Molly and she didn't wear shades, reflective or otherwise.

She was watching the length of the platform.

Hua Lamphong at dusk: a warm wind blowing through the open platforms where the giant beasts puffed smoke and steam into the humid air, the roof of the train station arching high overhead.

Her name wasn't Noi, either, in case you asked, though it's a common enough name. It wasn't Porn, or Ping. It wasn't even Friday.

She was watching the platform, scanning passengers climbing aboard, porters shifting wares, uniformed police patrolling at leisure. She was there to watch out for the Old Man.

She wasn't even a girl. Not exactly. And as for why the Old Man was called the Old Mannbsp;.nbsp;.nbsp;.

He was otherwise known as Boss Gui: head andnbsp;bigfala bos of the Kunming Toads. She got the job when she'd killed Gui's Toad bodyguardsmdash;by default, as it were.

But that had happened back in Kunming. This was Bangkok, Bangkok at duskmdash;this was Hua Lamphong, greatest of train stations, where the great slugs breathed steam and were rubbed and scrubbed by the slug-boys whose job it was to nurture them before departure. And the Old Man wasn't exactly an old man, either.

Scanning, waiting for the Old Man to arrive: Yankee tourists with in-built cams flashing as they posed besides the great beasts, these neo-nagas of reconstituted DNA, primitive nervous system, and prodigious appetite. Scanning: a group of Martian-Chinese from Tong Yun City walking cautiouslymdash;unused to the heavier gravity of this home/planet. Scanning: three Malay businessmenmdash;Earth-Belt Corp. standardized reinforced skeletonsmdash;they moved gracefully, like dancersmdash;wired through and through, hooked up twenty-four Earth-hours an Earth-day, seven Earth-days a week to the money-form engines, the great pulsating web of commerce and data, that singing, Sol-system-wide, von Neumann-machine expanded network of networks of networks.nbsp;.nbsp;.nbsp;.

Wired with hidden weaponry, too: she made a note of that.

An assassin can take many shapes. It could be the sweet old lady carrying two perfectly balanced baskets of woven bamboo over her shoulders, each basket filled with sweet addictive fried Vietnamese bananas. It could be the dapper K-pop starlet with her entourage, ostensibly here to rough it a bit for the hovering cameras. It could be the couple of French backpackersmdash;he with long thinning silver hair and a cigarette between his lips, she with a new face courtesy of Soi Cowboy's front-and-back street cosmetic surgeriesmdash;baby-doll face, but the hands never lie and the hands showed her true age, in the lines etched there, the drying of the skin, the quick-bitten nails polished a cheap redmdash;

An assassin could be anyone. A Yankee rich kid on a retro-trip across Asia, readingnbsp;Air America ornbsp;Neuromancer in a genuine reproduction 1984 POD-paperback; it could be the courteous policeman helping a pretty young Lao girl with her luggage; it could be the girl herselfmdash;an Issan farmer's daughter exported to Bangkok in a century-long tradition, body augmented with vibratory vaginal inserts, perfect audio/visual-to-export, always-on record, a carefully tended Louis Wu habit and an as-carefully-tended retirement planmdash;make enough money, get back home to Issannbsp;wan bigfala mama, open up a bar/hotel/bookshop and spend your days on the Mekong, waxing lyrical about the good old days, listening to Thai pop and K-pop and Nuevo Kwasa-Kwasa, growing misty-eyed nostalgic.nbsp;.nbsp;.nbsp;.

Could be anyone. She waited for the Old Man to arrive. The trains in Hua Lamphong never left on time.

Her name before, or after, doesn't matter. They used to call her Mulan Rouge, whi...</itunes:summary>

A Small Matter, Really
By  Monte Cook

Only the Catholic Church of Osirus would have enough money to afford not one, but two black holes.  Standing within the majestic narthex, Maria McNaki imagined the vibration of  complex machinery under her feet, despite the fact that the nanosensors laced  into her flesh revealed nothing other than the passing of the people in the  crowd and the chanting coming from deeper within the  cathedral.

The stone walls of the  chamber slowly flowed with a liquid relief of gothic circuitry and religious  hieroglyphic animations. The glyph depicting Setan as he tore the crucified  Osirus-Christ into tiny fragments malfunctioned and remained static. Just as  well. The petitioners around her made carefully devout hand signs over their  hearts as they faced the ankh crucifix over the door into the  sanctuary.

Religion was back in  fashion this season.

Three identical priests  stood next to the holy water fonts, welcoming the incoming congregation. Their  white collars and black robes stood starched-still. Geneticists form-shaped all  Catholic-Osirus priests into the gentle, fatherly form selected by church PR,  but these three were special. The bright eyes and the shining hair indicated Aesthicel, the most expensive genengineering firm in the Earth system. This  parish liked to spend money.

Perfect. That most  likely meant that they were interested in obtaining more.



Terrence told her that  the facility lay underneath the cathedral. Maria made her way past the incoming  worshipers as quickly and politely as she could.

Stout-of-Heart mewled  behind her, trying to keep up. The alienrsquo;s appearance disturbed a few in the  crowd, and Maria realized that bringing him might not have been the best idea  after all. The four-foot, shaggy bramagian bore the minder headband that marked  him as a trained urban bodyguard, but his claws and tusks still instilled fear  in many humans. The headband also allowed the creature to access a private data  field that existed only between the two of them. Through it, Maria could  communicate with him. Nevertheless, she preferred it much better when Piotr had  tended to the bramagian.

ldquo;Lord, what is this  place?rdquo; Stout-of-Heart asked her. She hated being called Lord, but the  bramagians were so fiercely misogynistic that it was best if they thought of all  humans as male. Maria had no idea how to explain the church to Stout-of-Heart.  Bramagians taken by humans from their homeworld already believed that they were  in Heaven, walking among the gods. If she told him that the gods also worshipped  gods, it might be too much for him. Among the bramagians, madness was a fate  worse than death.

ldquo;Never mind,  Stout-of-Heart,rdquo; she uploaded into their link. ldquo;Itrsquo;s too difficult to explain.rdquo;  Her assurances would only work for so long. Although the aliens were happy to be  warriors in Heaven, they were intensely curious about everything they  encountered there.

Elevator doors stood  closed to the right of the sanctuary entrance. More boy than man, a guard stood  in front of them, arms folded as if he could possibly appear menacing. He wore  black robes but no priestly collar and his temple sported a removable receiver  implant. Maria knew better than to be deceived by looks. Muscle-augmentation,  hidden disrupters or even nanite drones could all be concealed. Instead, she  produced her most powerful weapon as she approached the slight guard--a  cashstick keyed to more than this man made in a month.

He stepped aside with a  smile, and the lift doors opened. Maria entered the elevator and whispered ldquo;all  the way down,rdquo; to the man with a smile of her own and a nod. Stout-of-Heart  followed her in, and the doors closed. She smoothed ...</itunes:summary>

In the Water
by Katherine Mankiller

Yvonne looked up from her monitor, the beads in her cornrows clattering as Roger walked into her office.

Roger sat in the dark wooden chair opposite her desk.  "Weren't you assigned Alice van Buuren?"

"Oh, no you don't," Yvonne said.  "You can't have her."  Yvonne hadn't been assigned Alice; she'd requested her.  Alice was probably the only murder victim's wife she would ever meet. They hadn't even put the murder in the papers.  Maybe they thought there'd be a panic.

"Please," Roger said.  "I'm just trying to save you some trouble. I've already spoken to her, and..."

Yvonne crossed her arms and glared.  "Wouldn't you raise hell if I talked to one of your patients behind your back?"

"She's refusing modern therapy.  What are you going to do, use the old-fashioned techniques your grandmother used?"

Roger had a lot of nerve mentioning Grandma.  Yvonne glanced at the photo on the corner of her desk.  Grandma Jackson had been a big woman, with braids down to her hips and skin like chocolate.  Grandma Jackson smiled back at the camera, all reassuring good nature.

Roger said, "I think we should just wipe her and have done with it."

"Too bad she's not your patient," Yvonne said.



"I could take her away from you, you know."

"Don't you dare!"

There was an awkward silence.

"It'll be less confusing for her if I come with you," Roger said. "Just to hand her off to you.  You understand."

"Fine," Yvonne said.  "Whatever."

"Good girl," Roger said, and Yvonne gritted her teeth.  "Room 314." He stood.  "Let's go."

"Now?" Yvonne said.  She picked up her coffee and almost took a sip, then put it down again, making a face.  It was cold, and it had been so bitter hot that she'd taken caffeine pills with orange juice instead.

Roger snorted.  "That bad?"

Roger clearly wasn't going anywhere, so Yvonne stood, picked up her jacket, and followed Roger out of her office.  The halls were white to the point of being blinding after her calm, earth-toned office, and reeked of disinfectant.

They went upstairs and over to room 314.  Roger placed his hand on the identification plate and the door slid open.

"Hello, Alice," Roger said.

The patient, a skinny, pale woman with brown hair, backed away from Roger.  She reminded Yvonne of someone, although she couldn't put her finger on whom.

The patient fell into a seated position on the bed, mouth open, staring at Yvonne.  Before Yvonne could say anything, Roger said, "This is Doctor Jackson.  Doctor Jackson, this is Alice."

"We're not going to hurt you," Yvonne said.

The patient--Alice--stared at Yvonne for a moment, then shut her mouth.  She shot Roger a defiant look.

"I'll just leave you to it," Roger said, and left.

"Hello, Alice," Yvonne said.  "You can call me Yvonne if you prefer."

"We've met," Alice said.  It wasn't a question.

Alice really did look familiar. "Refresh my memory?"

"It doesn't matter," Alice said and looked away.

There was an uncomfortable silence.

Yvonne said, "Dr. Hill said you're refusing drug therapy."

"I had a negative reaction once," Alice said.

"Really?" Yvonne said.  "Usually that's associated with an interaction with an unapproved drug.  You should be fine this time; your blood tests came back clean."

"I wasn't on anything then, either," Alice said.

"That's very unusual," Yvonne said.

Alice shrugged.  "Just weird, I guess."

"He also said you object to memory modification."

Alice started to cry.

For a moment Yvonne just wanted to hug Alice and let her cry, but negative emotions caused crime.  It wasn't right to encourage Alice to carry on.  "You won't forget your marriage.  We'll just erase the trauma of his murder.  We can come up wit</itunes:summary>

Hello Allmdash;

We have listeners all over, and some of them will be heading into the winter months, but where I am spring has finally shook off the claws of winter.

But in the slice of science fiction fandom we all inhabit, spring is really notable for the return of Doctor Who to the airwaves, and thankfully for US fans, it is far closer to simultaneous transmission now that it has been the last few seasons. Physical distance matters less and less for communication, which in practice means that it is incredibly annoying to be in the US and looking at a twitter stream full of UK tweets about what the Doctorrsquo;s been on about that week. Spoilers suck (sweetie).

And speaking of the UK, we were very lucky and happy to run an interview with Lauren Beukes, who won this yearrsquo;s Arthur C. Clarke award for her novel Zoo City. Itrsquo;s available in an audio episode on our website, along with a (still audio) excerpt from thenbsp; book.

This month we were happy to bring you six stories, three of them flash. We ran three of the four honorable mentions from our flash contest fiction, which we should have done well before this. The forth and the three outright winners of the contest should be following in fairly close order.

We also brought you Abby Goldsmithrsquo;s A Taste Of Time, LaShawn Wanakrsquo;s Future Perfect, and Larry Hodgesrsquo; Tom the Universe. If you didnrsquo;t already listen to the on the lsquo;cast, I implore you to flick, scroll, click, or otherwise navigate several pages further in this to read them.

Until next month,

Tom the Universe
by Larry Hodges

I permeate this universe, which  I've named Tom, and guard against its destruction. If someone had done that for  the universe I came from, then Mary, my sweet Mary, would still be alive, and I wouldn't have killed her and everyone else when I accidentally destroyed that  universe.

And now I'm on the verge of destroying much more.

Read More...



My name is also Tom. I was an  undergrad in neuroscience at Johns  Hopkins University in Baltimore that January in 2040 when I made the  discovery that doomed us all. My field of study was cognitive science, the study  of human consciousness. What makes us aware of ourselves? Is it just the  biomechanical workings of the brain, or something else?

Sherlock Holmes said, "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the  truth." I spent countless hours in the lab eliminating the impossible, and there  didn't seem to be anything left, improbable or not. The interconnectivity  required for human consciousness to exist was just too many levels beyond what  was possible. By all rights, we should all be unconscious blobs of matter  mechanically going about our business as directed by electronic impulses from  the brain, with no more consciousness than a calculator. I suffered brain cramps  in the lab trying to figure out what improbables were left.

When I could think of nothing else to try, it was time to relax and let my subconscious figure it out. So I got out the Frisbee and called my lab partners.

Mary, Joey, and I--Tommy, as they called me--called ourselves the "ees."  I'd only met Mary when we'd started college, and adored how she laughed when I  explained my love for her in neurological terms, with dopamine and  neurotransmitters. We did everything together, or so I thought; classes and  labs, movies, and late-night bull sessions with pizza and ice cream, usually  followed by pints of morning coffee. Our future together was assured; as soon as  we graduated, we would get married. I'd even convinced her we should wear purity  rings--I had special ones made up with a brain emblem.

Joey and I grew up together on the same street, playing stickball and  videogames. He and I were going to be buddies for life.

Professor Wilson, our adviser, reluctantly let the three of us be lab  partners even though he said it's best not to put friends together. Amazingly,  we got a lot done when we weren't reading the neurology cartoons taped to the  walls or playing with Catzilla, the lab's iguana-bodied, cat-brained hybrid  mascot. And then came that morning when we went outside the lab on Charles Street to  toss the Frisbee around among the oak trees by the front steps. The fresh air  was an escape from the antiseptic stench of the lab.

"You throw like a girl!" Joey said when my toss to him banged against the  ground, way off line. He stood half a head taller than me, with that eternal  mischievous grin I'd known for twenty years. He was the only person in the world  who could get away with a ponytailed bouffant, which I would yank every  chance.

"Like a girl, huh?" Mary said, throwing the Frisbee as hard as she could  at Joey, who barely blocked it. Mary grabbed the rebound and faked another throw  while Joey cringed. "Want some more?" She was my sweet pixie, five feet of tiger  and spice, never still, never silent. Recently she'd taken to tying her long  blond hair in a ponytail like Joey, giving me a second target to yank. I was the  smart one, with a crew cut.

"Okay," Joey said, "you win. You both throw like girls!" Mary smacked  him with the frisbee again.

As we tossed it around, I became aware of my awareness of the Frisbee's location at any given moment. Somehow my mind tracked this and so many other  thi</itunes:summary>

Episode 37 - Captain Max Stone versus DESTRUCTOBOT!
 By Angela Lee
Read by: Joshua McNichols

When last we left our heroes, Captain Max Stone and his brother Billy had just navigated Hyperion's perilous asteroid field and battled their way into the fortified base of the villainous robot Destructobot.  The dastardly robot's latest scheme is the deadliest yet - he intends to destroy the Earth using a high-powered negabomb!  Will Max stop Destructobot in time? Or will the earth be vaporized?

Many Mistakes, All Out of Order

The first mistake was in our thinking they were ghosts.  In our defense, the tradition of vanishing, translucent figures wailing in the night mightrsquo;ve influenced us.

Mr. Omega checked the time on his trans-dimensional pocket watch and stared out the taxirsquo;s rain pelted window.  Four minutes to midnight.  Four minutes to the culmination of his lifersquo;s work.</itunes:summary>

Future Perfect
By LaShawn M. Wanak

I saw you at a party once. You stood by the bookshelf, reading a tattered volume on Proust. You wore an orange and yellow XTC shirt beneath brown flannel. I bumped your elbow by accident and you looked up, your eyes startling green.

I smiled and said, "Hi. I'm Nina."

"Hi. Eric."

I trailed behind you for the rest of the party. You introduced me to your friends and I laughed at their jokes. Twice, our sleeves brushed against each other.

Around two in the morning, you left with your friends. An hour later, I also left. I crossed the empty campus, humming under my breath, wondering if I'd ever see you again.

The watch on my arm beeped.

*

"This experiment will measure how small changes occurring before a certain event affect its outcome positively and negatively."

The chair is her creation. She bought the frame on impulse at a medical supply shop. The conical helmet, perforated with slender tubes, fits on top. Whenever she maneuvers her head beneath it, she thinks of the hair dryers at her mother's beauty salon. All those bulky astronaut bonnets lined in perfect rows, vibrating air molecules to a feverish pitch. She likes this scientific homage to her mother extracting time from thin air.

"Recording of the control event complete. Setting a change in a condition set slightly in the past. The goal of this first jump is to see if this will change the outcome of the event to a more positive circumstance."

She types on the laptop built into the armrest, then glances at the elaborate flowchart tacked upon the far wall of the laboratory. Written in
her own hand, neat and precise, equations and sums branch and connect like a roadmap of a probability highway.

She wonders which formula will have his lips pressing against hers.

"Test #1. Begin."

Read More...

*

I saw you at a party once. You stood next to Muriel, hair rumpled, clothes wrinkled. I had my hair permed that morning so it hung straight over my eyes. I wore tight-fitting jeans and a blue top with spaghetti straps.

I didn't speak to you, just hung out with a couple of my girlfriends. When "Atomic Dog" came on the stereo, I shimmied to the bookcase, shaking my hips and wiggling my butt. Only then I noticed you, you and your startling green eyes. You smiled and said, "Hi, there." Muriel looked over and pulled you from the room.

Later, while getting punch, I looked out the window and saw you and Muriel standing on the sidewalk below. She cupped your face, pulling it down to meet hers. I thought, Shame. He had nice eyes.

Then someone stepped on my foot and I swore, loudly. As the guy next to me apologized, the watch on my arm beeped.

You went on to have three children with Muriel. It took several years until I said yes to Brenton.

*

She rises from the chair, pulling the sensors from her body. She takes a sip of lukewarm coffee and frowns at the chart on the wall.

The outcome remained the same, but that was to be expected. With so many variables, it will take time to narrow down the finite set of outcomes, both positive and negative. She isn't worried; after all, only two possible outcomes can come from this event.

She picks up a black magic marker and crosses off a number with an 'X'.

*

We came to the party together, your arm slung around my shoulders. You and I had met several weeks before. Within a week, we were dating. Within six weeks, we were an 'item'.

Muriel was there as well, dancing alone by the bookshelves. Though my hand was buried in your back pocket, you couldn't tear your eyes from her. I distracted you by pulling you over to introduce my friends. You nodded, laughed at someone's joke and glanced towards the corner.

Brenton asked if the punchbowl ne</itunes:summary>

A Taste of Time
by Abby Goldsmith

1.

On the night she turned twenty-nine, Jane sat on her narrow bed, watching TV and drinking alone.  She'd gone through a bottle of wine and was mostly through a second bottle.  Tomorrow morning would be painful.

Or she could stop worrying about tomorrow.  The ibuprofen in her cabinet kept popping into her mind.  Jane wasn't sure if all those pills chased by alcohol would be enough to end her life, but the idea of looking up how to commit suicide online seemed just too pathetic.

The front door of her tiny apartment creaked open.

Jane leaned forward, peering through her bedroom doorway.  A black wine bottle stood on the floor, with a placard dangling from its silver ribbon.

Her gaze immediately went to the deadbolt.  It was in place, as she'd left it.

Jane shut the TV off and listened for noises from the hallway.  All she heard were the sounds of Boston traffic outside.  Several weeks ago, after she'd come home to find her boyfriend screwing a fat chick on her couch, shersquo;d had the locks changed.  No one could have gotten in.

Yet the bottle sat mysteriously on the wooden floor.

At last, Jane crossed her apartment, checking every shadow for an intruder.

She picked up the bottle.  The placard had gilded letters, making it a potentially expensive gift.

Tabula Rasa
Warning: There Is No Return

Jane flipped the placard over twice, but nothing else was written on it.

She listened, alert for any noise.  Mystery had never been much a part of her adult life, and it gave her a strangely excited feeling.  If the warning label meant something like _poison_, it seemed like a more dignified way to go than pills and alcohol.

Her reflection on the black surface of the bottle was disturbingly clear.  There she was: Plain Jane, a frumpy woman with a double-chin and acne scars.

She unscrewed the cap and popped the foil underneath.  A stringent smell wafted up, making her wrinkle her nose and salivate at the same time.

"Happy birthday, Jane," she told herself, and swallowed a mouthful.

2.

Jane gagged on the sour taste in her mouth.  She was so dizzy, she'd fallen . . . but she was sitting in an office chair, with no memory whatsoever of leaving her dark and quiet apartment.

Florescent lights beat down on her, and the familiar voices of a call center surrounded her.  None of this was possible.  She was back at her old workplace.  It was a workday, late afternoon, judging by the angle of light.  Ultimata Insurance had laid her off months ago, yet here she was.

A man rapped his knuckles against Jane's desk.  "I gave you the files you needed, right?"  Her old boss, Moore, didn't bother to wait for a reply.  He was always in a hurry.  Jane barely started to nod before he rushed away.

The walls of her cubicle looked exactly the way she remembered.  There was the photograph of herself and mom.  There was the generic Ultimata calendar, flipped to October 2009 . . . Jane double-checked the year. 2009 was a full two years before the company downsized.  If this was October 2009, then she was still employed.

And still dating the jerk, Aaron.

Her fists tightened, and she realized that her hand was clamped around the black wine bottle.  She might lose her job more quickly this time, if they saw that.  She hid it beneath her desk.

"Jane!"

Jane swiveled to face Stephanie, who worked in the cubicle across from hers.  Stephanie was slim with bouncy golden hair, and never deigned to speak to plain Jane.

Stephanie hurried across into Jane's cubicle, giving a sneaky look both ways before crossing.  She beamed at Jane.  "...</itunes:summary>

Welcome to April! mdash;

March was a sad month worldwide, and I, frankly, am looking forward to leaving winter behind. (Yeah, I know March starts spring in the Northern Hemisphere, but the damp and dank weather wersquo;ve been having the US South makes me feel more like winter than January did.)

First, the world was shocked by the disasters in Japan, earthquake, tsunami, and the continuing threat of radiation from their nuclear plant.

Then fantasy lost one of its masters with the death of Diana Wynne Jones. Any fan or writer of fantasy needs to read her Tough Guide to Fantasyland, and, well, any of her other books. Thirdlyhellip;

Well, hell, isnrsquo;t that enough?

Many people find themselves feeling lost and useless when it comes to disasters, especially if theyrsquo;re happening far away. Luckily, some very quick and innovative SFF fans and professionals (including Pseudopodrsquo;s own Alasdair Stuart) got together to create Genre for Japan ( http://genreforjapan.wordpress.com/ ), an auction featuring signed books from authors, collections of books from publishers (like Tor and Angry Robot), and editing or critique services from agents and editors. All proceeds go to the Japan Tsunami Appeal run by the British Red Cross. (They know what theyrsquo;re doing.) Give generously and you can get some awesome prizes.

We hope yoursquo;re enjoying the monthly Soundproof PDFs.

We have had gotten a couple of questions asking why some of our audio stories donrsquo;t get printed on the site or in the Soundproof. The answer is simple: we donrsquo;t have the rights.

We buy the audio and ebook rights to all stories we are able to, but sometimes we are only able to get the audio rights, so those stories are in our audio feed. As we move forward we will do everything we can to get both ebook and audio rights.

Herersquo;s to a better month.

The rsquo;76 Goldwater Dime
By John Medaille

I started in 1962, thatrsquo;s when I became a numismatist. You know what that is? Itrsquo;s the study ofhellip;.well, itrsquo;s not the study of anything. Itrsquo;s coin collecting, is what it is.

I was ten in 1962, and Christmas I got my first coin album. I didnrsquo;t actually get it. My father gave it to my brother. It was, you know, yoursquo;ve seen them, a sturdy cardboard folder with slots punched out that you put the coins in. Behind the slots, the empties, it had a backing of blue felt, I remember that. My dad gave it to my brother, I guess maybe thinking it would straighten him out. But coins, you know, they donrsquo;t really have that power. He wasnrsquo;t interested. He gave it to me. Me, I was interested.

The album was for Lincoln pennies, 1909 to 1959. I had five cents in the world then and each of the five fit in the slot. It only took me five more days to get the other forty-five. I would do anything for those pennies and slot it in its slot. Anything, anything. When I got my last penny, wow. It was a 1943 steel mint penny, a lsquo;steelie.rsquo; They had to use steel instead of copper that year cause they needed the copper for all the bombs. I was so proud.

From then on it was just coins for me. My life was coins. I was hooked. They had their hooks in me, boy.

When I was just seventeen I moved by myself down to Washington, DC, cause I got a job there in a coin shop. That was my education. I lived in a one room dungeon in a crumby neighborhood, I loved coins that much.

You know, and I do alright. I made my living. I own my own house. I donrsquo;t live in debt like everybody else does. Thatrsquo;s what coins did for me. Coins and specie and spec. I donrsquo;t care for paper money, it holds nothing for me.

Me, Irsquo;m a specialist. I know generalists, I do business with them, I have to. And speculators, sure. You do what you need to do to survive in the world. But me, Irsquo;m a specialist and my friends are specialists. Irsquo;ll give an example, I have a friend, he died. But before he died, his specialty was pay toilet tokens. I mean, have you ever seen a pay toilet? In your life? I saw some once in Europe but I donrsquo;t even know if they have them there anymore. Anyway, this friend of mine, he spends his life collecting these tokens, these coins, for pay toilets, from around the world and every age. He finds the obscurest pay toilet tokens there are and theyrsquo;re his. And then he dies alone in his apartment with these thousands of toilet tokens around him. I mean, thatrsquo;s the way to go. I mean that. To have these objects of joy around you. To you and me, they are not objects of joy, but to him they are. You know, not everybody gets to have that, itrsquo;s not something that everyone receives. To have such pleasure from these things, these old things. But he does and I do because, see, wersquo;re specialists. Not everybody understands that.

Other people I know, you know, have their special collections. Any thing you can think of, any given thing and therersquo;s some guy like me out there obsessed with it. I know people, you meet a lot of interesting people in this business, whose specialties are Depression era wooden nickels or peep show tokens, or misprint coins, error coins, or brockage, thatrsquo;s coins with mirror image stamps on both sides, or obverses or lsquo;Godless Dollars.rsquo; You ever heard of lsquo;Godless Dollars?rsquo; Those are dollar coins where the ldquo;In God we trustrdquo; part got left off. Now, you see, I respect that. Those are people with specialties. They are connoisseurs, like me. Not any old crap will do.

Jaiden's Weaver
by Mary Robinette Kowal

I was never one of those girls who fell in love with horses. For one thing, on our part of New Oregon they were largely impractical animals. Most of the countryside consisted of forests attached to sheer hills and you wanted to ride something with a little more clinging ability. So from the time I was, well, from the time I can remember I wanted a teddy bear spider more than I wanted to breathe.

The problem is that teddy bear spiders were not cheap, especially not for a pioneer family trying to make a go of it.

Mom and Dad had moved us out of Landington in the first wave of expansion, to take advantage of the homesteading act. Our new place was way out on the eastern side of the Olson mountains where Dad had found this natural level patch about halfway up a forested ridge, so we got sunshine all year round, except for the weeks in spring and autumn when the shadow of our planet's rings passed over us. Our simple extruded concrete house had nothing going for it except a view of the valley, which faced due south to where the rings were like a giant arch in the sky. Even as a twelve-year-old, angry at being taken away from our livewalls in town to this dead structure, I fell in love with the wild beauty of the trees clinging to the sheer faces of the valley walls.

The only thing that would have made it better was a teddy bear spider so I could go exploring on my own. I felt trapped by the walls of the house and the valley. I had this dream that, if I had a spider, that I'd be able to sell its weavings for enough to install livewalls in my room. That's not as crazy as it sounds; teddy-bear spider weavings are collected all over the colonies and sell for insane amounts of money.

I had a search setup so anytime there was news of a teddy bear spider or a new tube surfaced, I'd be right there, watching those adorable long-legged beasts. I loved their plump furry faces and wanted to run my fingers through their silky russet fur.

I wonder what goes through a survey team's mind when they name things. I mean a teddy bear spider isn't a bear and it isn't a spider, but it looks like both those things. On the other hand, a fartycat looks nothing like a cat. They do stink, though.

Not quite a year after we'd moved, one of my city friends had forwarded an ad from a local board which set my heart to racing.

Teddy bear spider eggs: 75NOD shipped direct.

Read More...

See, I'd been looking at adult or adolescent teddies which cost more than my folks had set aside for me to go to university. It hadn't even occurred to me that I could raise one up myself. My mindless yearning changed into purpose.

I slapped that ad onto a piece of epaper and ran into the kitchen. "Dad! Mom! Look at this."

Dad glanced up from the eggs he was cracking into a bowl and pursed his lips the way he always did right before saying _no._ "Jaiden, that's a lot of money."

I waved the ad again as if it were a token to get me on a ride at the fair. "We'd make back the money when the teddy started to weave. Please? I've seen their weavings in stores for hundreds of NOD."
Mom ganged up on me. "That's how much the store sells a weaving for, it's not how much they pay for them. Even if it were, you're not just talking the cost of the eggs. It's the cost of feeding it, housing it, vet bills..."

I knew better than to keep arguing. Sometimes if I waited and tried again later, I could get them to change their minds. Still holding the ad, I went outside and plopped on the log bench Dad had made for the front of the house. The broad silver band of the ring spanned the sky, blocked by only a few clouds.</itunes:summary>

On a Clear Day You can See All the Way to Conspiracy
by Desmond Warzel

You're listening to the Mike Colavito Show on Cleveland's home for straight talk, WCUY 1200. The opinions expressed on this program do not reflect those of WCUY, its management, or its sponsors.

Fair warning; I'm in a mood today, folks.

We've got a mayor whose only talent seems to be showing up at luncheons and waving at the cameras.

Eighty bucks I had to pay yesterday for not wearing my seatbelt. Show me the seatbelts on a school bus.

I saw a Cleveland athlete on national TV last night wearing a Yankees cap.

And every day I get at least a dozen calls from schmucks who think that people like me are the problem in this city.

Tell me America's not falling apart.

[pause]

And some of you people--including our programming director, by the way--seem to think I'm running my mouth too much and not taking enough phone calls. I've only been number one in radio in this city for ten straight years; what would I know?

You want calls? You got 'em. Steven in Mayfield Heights, you're on the air.

"Hey, what's up, Mike?"

The rent. Art in Seven Hills, you're on WCUY.

"How you doing, Mike. Just wondering if you caught that ball game last night?"

No. Andrea in Rocky River, go ahead.

"Hi, Mike, first-time caller."

Well, call back tomorrow and you'll be a second-time caller. Carol in Cleveland, what's on your mind?

"Mike, what do you think of waterboarding?"

My wife and I waterboard all the time, and it's improved our sex life dramatically. Chuck in Parma, you're on the air.

"Hey, Mike, I heard your show yesterday, and I was just wondering, if you know so much about football, why you don't take over as head coach of the Browns?"

I wouldn't want to take the pay cut. Mina in Lakewood, you're on the air.

"Does your wife think that waterboarding crack was funny?"

Play your cards right some night and you could find out for yourself, Mina. Tommy in Beachwood, you're on WCUY.

"Hi, Mike, just wondering who you think the Indians should try and trade for next year."

Your mother. Jane in Euclid, go ahead.

Looks like we lost Jane in Euclid. Must have answered her question already. That's all right; we got in seven callers in under a minute. Everyone happy now? Hey, Jake, I have to take a breather; do the traffic.

What?

Oh, yeah. This traffic is brought to you by West Side Hardware.

Thanks, Mike. Not much happening right now; 480, 271, and 77 are all clear, but traffic on the Shoreway is backed up in both directions, so our listeners might want to allow a few extra minutes if they're headed that way. For West Side Hardware, this has been your WCUY traffic report on Cleveland's home for straight talk.

Hey, Jake, don't go yet. You still there? I gotta take the Shoreway home after the show. Any idea what the holdup is?

Can't say, Mike; no accidents, just a general slowdown all along the lakeshore.

Wonderful.

And people wonder why I'm always giving the mayor grief. Straightest stretch of highway in America, and traffic still won't move. Somebody on the Shoreway, call in and tell me what the hell's going on over there. Franklin in Cleveland, you're on the air.

"What's up, Mike? You gonna let me talk?"

Don't worry, it's all out of my system. The floor's yours.

"Well, you're entitled to your opinion about the mayor, but come on, man, how you gonna blame him for slow traffic?"

The traffic's just a symptom. I'm talking about neglect. Name me one thing the mayor's accomplished since he took office.

"Well--"

You can't, Franklin, beca</itunes:summary>

Grandfather Paradox
by Katherine Mankiller

JUNE 23, 1994

Ann stuffed her blood-spattered clothes into the next door apartment complex's dumpster.  He wasn't dead, but it was harder to get a knife through someone's chest than she'd expected.  Maybe he'd bleed to death before someone found him.  She didn't care either way.  She was a juvenile, so it wasn't like she was going to fry.

She walked.  The YMCA was open.  She locked herself in the men's room, curled up on the floor, and fell asleep.

The next morning, she stopped at an IHOP and told a grey-haired waitress, "I don't have any money, but can I have a cup of coffee?" The waitress must have felt sorry for her:  she bought her breakfast. Afterwards, she went to Safeway and hid a steak and a bottle of beer under her coat and walked out.  And kept walking.  Someone had a barbecue grill in their back yard.  She took it, and the charcoal, too.

What she could really go for now was some mushrooms.  She should swipe some Kool-Aid and find a cow pasture.  Or maybe she could rob a veterinary clinic.  Anything to get the thought of him touching her out of her head, and that beer wasn't going to cut it.

Steak and beer.  Almost luxurious.

The sign read "Open House."  Yes, that sounded about perfect.  She spent the night there, on the carpet smelling faintly of shampoo.

It had happened to him, too.  What her father had done to her, his father had done to him.  Which, in her opinion, just made it worse. He knew what it was like.

When the police arrived and told her she was under arrest for murder, she couldn't stop laughing.

The crane lifted the sealed concrete container out of the hole in the ground.  Ann lay down in the snow next to the hole and reached inside.  "My arms are too short," she said.

Martin lay down next to her.

"Excuse me?" Dr. Chandler, the president of the university, said.

"I'm sorry," Martin said.  "I thought my department chair had spoken to you.  Martin Robbins, physics.  My head programmer, Ann O'Connell. Please, continue."

Dr. Chandler gave them a dirty look, then walked over to the microphone.  "This time capsule was sealed in 1914.  The items inside represent what they wanted us to know about the past.  I'm sure our history department is hoping I'll cut the speech short and let them get at it..."

There was a chuckle from the crowd.

"Got it," Martin said.  He pulled out a grimy Tyvek envelope, and opened it.  Inside, there was a penny dated 2013.  Martin smiled at her.  "Looks like our own time capsule arrived intact."

FEBRUARY 9, 2014

"How are you feeling today, Ann?"  Dr. Katz asked.  Her glasses were perched precariously on her nose, and her bun was in danger of falling down.

Screw her.  "Is my hour up yet?"

"No."

Fine.  Be that way.

"How are things going with Martin?"

"I stopped dating Martin."

"Why?"

"Because he wanted to sleep with me.  It was awful.  Ugh."

Dr. Katz was giving Ann that psychiatrist look.  Well, Ann had felt like she had to.  Saying no would be rude.  Well, not rude, but... Anyway, no more Martin.  She'd had her phone number changed, and if he came around again?  Restraining order.  Work the system, or the system works you.

"How does that affect your job?" Dr. Katz asked.

"I have vacation time," Ann said.  "I took it."

Yoursquo;re Almost Here
by Melinda Thielbar
 
ldquo;Can I share your table?rdquo;

You look up to see your dream girl. Red hair, cream-colored skin, face just a little round, breasts just a little small. Not movie-star beautiful, not perfect just--nice. She smiles, and her cheeks dimple, and yoursquo;re in love. You gesture to the empty chair across from you with a grin of your own.

ldquo;Be my guest,rdquo; you say.

ldquo;Thanks.rdquo; She takes the chair and sets her coffee cup down. You close the notebook in front of you and open your mouth to say somethingmdash;anythingmdash;to impress this girl.
 
Without looking at you, she turns in her chair, pulls a phone out of her pocket and bends over it. You watch her face in profile as she slips a pair of earbuds into her ears. Your mouth is still open, so you close it and look away. Thatrsquo;s when you see that every table is occupied. Men in suits, women in suits, a few people your age in khakis or jeans. Theyrsquo;re all looking down at their phones, laptops, or handheld game consoles. Sunlight streams in through the floor-to-ceiling windows, and you watch people passing by on the street for a minute. Theyrsquo;re all looking straight ahead, faces set the way they have to be in a city this size. When itrsquo;s this crowded, the only privacy you can give a stranger is not to notice them. That idea interests you, and so you open your notebook to jot it down at the bottom of the second-to-last page. As yoursquo;re writing, a chair scrapes behind you, and a guy in a navy three-piece moves past. He flips his phone open and then closed again, checking the time, and hurries out.
 
The girl across from you moves almost as fast as he does. ldquo;Thanks,rdquo; she says and flashes that amazing smile again before she grabs her drink and hops to the newly-open table. You write FUCK across the top of the second-to-last page of your notebook, tuck it into your pocket, and go get another coffee.

The barristomatic (you call it this; no one else does), takes your thumbprint and opens a menu with your recent drink selections. Theyrsquo;re supposed to be sorted so the one you drink most is at the top. For you, it might as well be random. You do something different every time. This onersquo;s a half-pump vanilla, half-pump strawberry, soy milk latte with a lousy espresso bean that still costs more than all the other ingredients put together because itrsquo;s fair-trade and organic. You once enumerated every combination, ranked them from most to least expensive an...</itunes:summary>
