<p><i>Seated on a bollard, the man contemplatively removed his pipe, as if to tamp
it down or relight it. Instead, he placed it stem down in the top pocket of
his shirt, then reached up and pressed his fingers against his cheekbone and
forehead. His face came away from his hairline, round behind his ears, down
to a point just above his Adam’s apple. The inside of his mouth and much of
his sinus were also part of the prosthesis, so only bare eyeballs in the
upper jut of his skull remained – the rest being the black spikes and plates
of bio-interfaces.</i></p>

<p><i>Cheel gaped. From another pocket, the man took some sort of tool and began
to probe inside the back of his detached face. He put the prosthesis in his
lap, then took up his pipe and placed it in his throat sphincter. Smoke bled
from between the interface plates of his cheeks. His bare eyeballs swivelled
towards Cheel then back down to the adjustments he was making. She suddenly
realised who this must be. Here was the veteran who worked on the ferry.
Here was one of the few survivors from a brutal war between factions of
dense-tech humans. Not understanding what was impelling her, she walked out
on the jetty and approached him.

"I read an interesting forum post last night," my electric toothbrush told me over its low burr.

"Thiff ouff thew be thood," I said through my mouth of foam.

<p><i>I was a child when the sky changed. I can still remember days when it was endlessly blue, the clouds passive and gentle. The change occurred without warning: one morning we awoke and the sky was a pale, blushing rose. We began to see intention in the slow, ceaseless movements of the clouds. Instead of floating, they swam spirals in the sky. They gathered in knots, trailing wisps like feet and tails. We felt them watching us.</i></p>

<p><i>We adapted. We had never taken more than we needed from the land, and we always kept our animals far from water. Now we moistened wild cotton and stretched this across our smoke holes as filters. Sometimes the clouds would gather over fires that were out in the open. A tendril would stretch down, weaving like a snake&#8217;s head, opening delicate mist jaws to nip the plume of smoke. Even the bravest warriors would quickly put such fires out.</i></p>

<p>Musical guest: &#8220;First of May,&#8221; written by <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com">Jonathan Coulton</a> and performed by <a href="http://addcast.net/wordpress/?p=83">many podcasters</a> for the <a href="http://www.joemurphymemorialfund.com">Joe Murphy Memorial Fund</a>.</p>

<p><i>Yet Mme. Theuret&#8217;s word-of-mouth reputation was to die for.  Both the official feedback data and the school&#8217;s on-line forums placed her among Wilhelm U&#8217;s most popular instructors.  It was a matter of technique. Wilhelm U was awash in eye candy, but Monique&#8217;s pitch-perfect mastery of lascivious restraint was something else entirely.</i></p>

<p><i>All thirty-eight of her new students&#8211;she&#8217;d have wagered a month&#8217;s salary that not a soul had skipped this class&#8211;now looked at her with naked desire, even though she&#8217;d merely introduced herself.</i></p>

<p><i>She remained silent to let the anticipation build a bit, to inform them they were now at her mercy.  &#8220;Welcome,&#8221; she finally said, &#8220;to Computer Science 338, Artificial Intelligence.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><b>Rated X</b>.  Contains explicit sexual description, sexual innuendo, sexual themes &#8212; and some sex.</p>

Yet Mme. Theuret's word-of-mouth reputation was to die for.  Both the official feedback data and the school's on-line forums placed her among Wilhelm U's most popular instructors.  It was a matter of technique. Wilhelm U was awash in eye candy, but Monique's pitch-perfect mastery of lascivious restraint was something else entirely.

All thirty-eight of her new students--she'd have wagered a month's salary that not a soul had skipped this class--now looked at her with naked desire, even though she'd merely introduced herself.

She remained silent to let the anticipation build a bit, to inform them they were now at her mercy.  "Welcome," she finally said, "to Computer Science 338, Artificial Intelligence."


Rated X.  Contains explicit sexual description, sexual innuendo, sexual themes -- and some sex.
