Closing music: &#8220;The Fall,&#8221; by <a href="http://www.whiskeyandapples.com/artists.htm">Red Hunter</a>.</p>

<p><i>I was a child when the sky changed. I can still remember days when it was endlessly blue, the clouds passive and gentle. The change occurred without warning: one morning we awoke and the sky was a pale, blushing rose. We began to see intention in the slow, ceaseless movements of the clouds. Instead of floating, they swam spirals in the sky. They gathered in knots, trailing wisps like feet and tails. We felt them watching us.</i></p>

<p><i>We adapted. We had never taken more than we needed from the land, and we always kept our animals far from water. Now we moistened wild cotton and stretched this across our smoke holes as filters. Sometimes the clouds would gather over fires that were out in the open. A tendril would stretch down, weaving like a snake&#8217;s head, opening delicate mist jaws to nip the plume of smoke. Even the bravest warriors would quickly put such fires out.</i></p>

Musical guest: "First of May," written by Jonathan Coulton and performed by many podcasters for the Joe Murphy Memorial Fund.


Yet Mme. Theuret's word-of-mouth reputation was to die for.  Both the official feedback data and the school's on-line forums placed her among Wilhelm U's most popular instructors.  It was a matter of technique. Wilhelm U was awash in eye candy, but Monique's pitch-perfect mastery of lascivious restraint was something else entirely.

All thirty-eight of her new students--she'd have wagered a month's salary that not a soul had skipped this class--now looked at her with naked desire, even though she'd merely introduced herself.

She remained silent to let the anticipation build a bit, to inform them they were now at her mercy.  "Welcome," she finally said, "to Computer Science 338, Artificial Intelligence."


Rated X.  Contains explicit sexual description, sexual innuendo, sexual themes -- and some sex.

<p><i>A man, a woman, and a child emerge from the Temple of the

out a smokeless cigar beneath his heel, and then increases his

<p><i>They approach me, and I will myself to become one with my

walkways before they can speak to me.</i></p>

<p><i>The  question was rather unnecessary.  Beta  was  almost at zenith, its

so because, as you see, Beta is the only sun in the sky.&#8221;  He smiled grimly.

"Of the six suns, only Beta is left in the sky. Do you see it?"

The  question was rather unnecessary.  Beta  was  almost at zenith, its
ruddy light  flooding the landscape to an unusual  orange  as  the brilliant
rays of setting Gamma died. Beta was at aphelion. It was small; smaller than
Theremon had ever seen it before, and for the moment it was undisputed ruler
of Lagash's sky.

Lagash's own  sun, Alpha, the  one about which  it revolved, was at the
antipodes, as were  the two distant companion pairs. The red dwarf Beta -- Alpha's immediate companion -- was alone, grimly alone.

Aton's upturned face flushed redly in the sunlight. "In just under four

First appeared in <a href="http://www.sfsite.com/fsf/">The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction</a>, August 2004.</p>

<p><i>Frankly, we were excited. This move was what our Pack needed &#8212; the four of us, at least, were sure of it. We were all tired of living in the ghetto &#8212; we were in three twentieth-century townhouses in Billings, in an &#8220;age-mixed&#8221; area full of marauding Thirteens and Fourteens and Fifteens. Talk about a people damned by CDAS &#8212; when the virus hit them, it had stuck their pituitaries and thyroids like throttles jammed open. It wasn&#8217;t just the giantism and health problems caused by a thirty-year overdose on growth hormones, testosterone, estrogen, and androgen. They suffered more from their social problems &#8212; criminality, violence, orgies, jealousy &#8212; and their endless self-pity.</i></p>

<p><i>Okay, Max liked them. And most of the rest of us had been at least entertained by living in the ghetto. At birthday parties, we could always shock the other Packs with our address. But that was when all eight of us were there, before Katrina and Ogbu went south. With eight of us, we&#8217;d felt like a full Pack &#8212; invincible, strong enough to laugh at anyone.</i></p>

<p><b>Rated R</b>.  Contains graphic sexual content and children who are a bit too grown up.  Literally.</p>
