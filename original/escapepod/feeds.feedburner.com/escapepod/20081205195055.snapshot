When Chasca turned eleven, her father took her to a ship farm, to choose her  vessel.  She stood on the observation deck, evaluating the herd.  Chasca  selected the farthest ship.  It faced away from the others and bumped the edges  of the corral.  She understood. 

Rated  G.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Folks:</p>

<p>Summary first.  Escape Pod is going to miss its weekly releases for the remainder of November.  We will resume in December, probably the first week.</p>

<p>Now the explanation.
<span id="more-321"></span></p>

<p>I suppose I could just say that I&#8217;m writing this just prior to leaving for my grandmother&#8217;s funeral.  She died a few weeks ago, and the memorial service is taking place in New Jersey this weekend.  That would be sufficient excuse to miss a week by almost anyone&#8217;s reckoning.  Add in a tough new day job,  lingering physical illness, and unstable brain chemistry, and I could really play for some sympathy here.  But it isn&#8217;t the complete picture.</p>

<p>The fact is that I need some time.  I need to get regrounded, for my own health and also for the good of Escape Pod.  Since May of 2005 we have not missed a week, and I&#8217;ve been very proud &#8212; perhaps hubristic &#8212; of having one of the longest uninterrupted runs in podcasting.  We&#8217;ve achieved some amazing things almost by accident: we&#8217;ve become the number two SF market with about 25,000 listeners, we&#8217;ve brought attention to incredible stories by previously unknown authors, and we&#8217;ve grown into a real business with two additional podcasts.  From a strategic point of view we&#8217;re doing all right.  We&#8217;re not totally where I wanted to be by now, but fundamentally we&#8217;re succeeding.</p>

<p>But tactically, with Escape Pod in particular, I&#8217;ve been flying way too close to the ground.  It&#8217;s been week-to-week and barely controlled chaos for a really long time now.  My communication&#8217;s always been behind, but now it&#8217;s by months.  The releases keep slipping, and sometimes I don&#8217;t know on Monday what the week&#8217;s story will be.  It&#8217;s been costing me more sleep than usual.  These are resolvable issues; I have a nice clear to-do list of obvious things that would make my job a lot easier.  (&#8221;Better delegation&#8221; covers about half the list.)  But I haven&#8217;t been stepping back to do any of them.  Even when I have the time, it&#8217;s been hard to muster the energy.</p>

<p>Most of all, I&#8217;m afraid of losing my perspective.  For a while now I&#8217;ve been pushing myself so hard on EP that it&#8217;s close to becoming more Not Fun than Fun.  I&#8217;m in danger of forgetting why I&#8217;m doing it.  And <i>that</i> is not something I can permit.  If I lose my own passion for the stories, I know I won&#8217;t be the only one who suffers.  That&#8217;s the point at which the podcast will start to suck.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m doing a very, <i>very</i> difficult thing right now for the sake of long-term success: I&#8217;m letting myself fail for a few weeks.  I&#8217;m taking a breather, relaxing a bit, and trying to forgive myself for doing it.  I&#8217;m going to do right by my grandmother, and then I&#8217;m going to take a few days to just chill, and <i>then</i> I&#8217;m going to see what I need to do to get organized and get on top of the game again.</p>

<p>I know it&#8217;s risky to pin such things to a schedule.  But I&#8217;m pretty confident in the range of this hiatus: it will not be less than two weeks, and it should not be more than four.  The smart money&#8217;s on three weeks, putting us back on in the first week of December.  We already have some great stuff pending.  We have the next Union Dues story, and in my opinion it&#8217;s the best one yet.  We have a fantastic alien world story from this year&#8217;s Cambpell Award winner, Mary Robinette Kowal.  And Mur Lafferty is preparing what may be the most kickass science fiction Christmas story ever.  I promise you we&#8217;ll be back soon, because dammit, <b><i>I</i></b> want to hear those things in audio.</p>

<p>Two logistical points:</p>

<p>First, <a href="http://podcastle.org">PodCastle</a> and <a href="http://pseudopod.org">Pseudopod</a> aren&#8217;t affected.  Rachel and Ann and Ben and Al are totally in the groove, and Escape Artists as a company is doing fine.  This announcement only affects Escape Pod.  So you&#8217;ve still got a short fiction fix, and if those aren&#8217;t enough, feel free to <a href="http://drabblecast.org">check</a> <a href="http://clonepod.org">out</a> <a href="http://dunesteef.com">some</a> <a href="http://welltoldtales.com">others</a>.</p>

<p>Second, I&#8217;m well aware that donors have a pretty good reason to be upset.  You&#8217;re giving your money on an article of faith, after all &#8212; that we&#8217;ll use it to keep bringing you stories &#8212; and if we&#8217;re not bringing them to you, even temporarily, we&#8217;re not keeping that trust.  We&#8217;ve recently had some <i>very</i> substantial donations, ones which I have yet to send proper thank-you messages for.  (Those are coming too.)  I&#8217;m hoping most of you will be cool with my reasoning here and bear with us.  But if you&#8217;ve donated in the past few months and you object to this hiatus, e-mail me from your PayPal address and let me know, and I will refund your money to you, no questions asked.  I would honestly rather keep your goodwill than your cash.</p>

<p>&#8230;So there you have it.  That&#8217;s the honest explanation of what&#8217;s going on, as best I can state it.  I&#8217;ll be spending the next few weeks gathering my wits, my priorities, and a team, probably in that order.  And then you&#8217;ll have more stories.  We&#8217;ll be back soon.  In the meantime, thank you for any patience you&#8217;re willing to give.</p>

<p>And of course: Have Fun.</p>

"I can do all things through explosives, who destroy for me." The man began moving the contents of the pack inside the pockets and straps of the trenchcoat, clipped more to his belt and thigh, as well as to holsters under each arm, and then added pieces to his ankles.

<p><i>She pushed off when her turn came, floating into the huge hold where she had to keep her line from tangling with other lines and stay alert for the seniors whose job it was to kill you—with their dye guns. In the Well, as throughout the ship, patches of enlivened hulls showed the view of near space through remote sensing. Here in the Well it was disorienting. Marie went into a tumble, then controlled it with a spray from her back pack. Through her enhanced visor, she could see her own team, spread out, their suits clear to her, but not to the seniors. A few of her team wore blue arm bands, not regulation, but overlooked more and more these days. Blue for the Admiral, blue for veneration—blue for sucking up to the brass.</i></p>

<p><b>Rated PG</b>.  It&#8217;s YA military SF.  Does contain some lewd conduct.</p>

Read by Dani Cutler (of Truth Seekers).
First appeared in Space Cadets, ed. Mike Resnick, as "Tall Enough For Navy"

She pushed off when her turn came, floating into the huge hold where she had to keep her line from tangling with other lines and stay alert for the seniors whose job it was to kill youmdash;with their dye guns. In the Well, as throughout the ship, patches of enlivened hulls showed the view of near space through remote sensing. Here in the Well it was disorienting. Marie went into a tumble, then controlled it with a spray from her back pack. Through her enhanced visor, she could see her own team, spread out, their suits clear to her, but not to the seniors. A few of her team wore blue arm bands, not regulation, but overlooked more and more these days. Blue for the Admiral, blue for venerationmdash;blue for sucking up to the brass.

Rated PG.  It's YA military SF.  Does contain some lewd conduct.

But Elderfolk were just-plains all grown up and they didn&#8217;t make any sense at all.

Every now and then we strike it rich. Usually we make a profit. Once in a while we just break even. There's only been one world where we actually lost money; I still remember it -- Greenwillow. Except that it wasn't green, and there wasn't a willow on the whole damned planet.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been in e-mail contact today with Jeffrey DeRego&#8217;s wife Cindy.  She tells me that he had open heart surgery yesterday to bypass five blocked arteries.  The surgery was successful and he&#8217;s expected to go home sometime next week.</p>

<p>If anyone cares to know for purposes of sending cards or flowers, etc., he&#8217;s at the Catholic Medical Center in Manchester, New Hampshire.  You&#8217;re also welcome to send cards via us (<b>Jeffrey DeRego, c/o Escape Artists Inc., PO Box 1538, Stone Mountain GA  30086</b>) and I&#8217;ll see that they get forwarded to him.</p>

<p>I asked if any financial assistance would be useful, and without getting into overly personal details, the answer is &#8220;yes.&#8221;  The DeRegos aren&#8217;t in a good position right now in terms of employment, and while they&#8217;re applying for state assistance, surgery of this magnitude is still certain to have a very harsh impact.  Escape Artists will be making a contribution, and with Cindy&#8217;s permission, I&#8217;m asking the Escape Pod listenership to help out.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve set up a PayPal address just for this purpose under our corporate account.  If you&#8217;d like to help Jeff out, please send your contributions via PayPal to <b>derego@escapepod.org</b>.  (I hope to have a better link on the sidebar by tonight.)  We&#8217;ll cover PayPal fees, so 100% of funds donated will go to defray Jeff&#8217;s and Cindy&#8217;s medical expenses.  I&#8217;ll keep that PayPal address open through September.</p>

<p>Please follow your conscience on whether to help.  Jeff&#8217;s given us some of our favorite EP stories, and I&#8217;m happy to do whatever I can for him.  If you see fit to help him out too, I&#8217;m sure he and his wife would be very grateful.  Thanks for your attention.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First: my apologies for recent delays in getting Escape Pod out; in the last couple of weeks it&#8217;s hit the feed Friday afternoons rather than late Thursday.  It&#8217;s <em>probably</em> going to happen again this week.  Personal business lately has included me losing my day job, finding a new and much better day job in the space of a couple of weeks (I start Tuesday), and taking on some short-term obligations to fill in the gaps.  Expect more on that in an upcoming metacast In the meantime I&#8217;m realizing I&#8217;m having to get <em>much</em> better organized with a lot of Escape Artists work, not for efficiency but for necessity.  So yes, things are late; but I still don&#8217;t expect to miss any weeks, and I hope that the lateness will be short term.</p>

<p>Now to the news: once again, Escape Pod and Minx&#8217;s <a href="http://polyweekly.com">Polyamory Weekly</a> will be hosting a joint meetup at Dragon*Con.  Just like last year, we&#8217;ll be doing a group brunch on <b>SUNDAY, AUGUST 31 AT 11:30 AM</b>, at the <a href="http://gordonbiersch.com/restaurants/index.php?pg=location&#038;sub=loc&#038;location_id=28">Gordon Biersch Brewpub</a>.  It&#8217;s about a mile north from the hotels, but an easy walk or cab ride.  This time we have the restaurant&#8217;s upper mezzanine reserved, so it&#8217;s like having the place to ourselves.  Ask at the front for the Escape Pod meetup.</p>

<p>Generally, I expect to hit very little programming at this year&#8217;s D*C.  My intent for almost the entire con is just to hang out at the bars or parties, and socialize and relax.  If you&#8217;d like to join me, follow my <a href="http://twitter.com/SFEley">Twitter feed</a> to find out where I am or <a href="mailto:sfeley@gmail.com">drop me a line</a> to met me know where you are.  And if you know where the <i>good</i> parties are &#8212; let me know too!</p>

<p>Thanks, and we&#8217;ll have the next EP up as soon as possible.  (It&#8217;s a Union Dues story, if that helps with the waiting.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Fenneman?&#8221;</p>

<p>The studio audience laughed loudly, as it always did when Groucho 
turned, in mock desperation or annoyance, to his long-suffering, 
hopelessly square announcer.  Groucho&#8217;s voice slightly increased in 
pitch whenever he said Fenneman’s name, as if he were just at the edge 
of losing his celebrated cool.  This half-squawk had been funny in the 
stateroom scene of <strong>A Night at the Opera</strong> (&#8221;Steward!  Steward!&#8221;), and 
it was still funny on <strong>You Bet Your Life</strong> twenty-five years later.  He 
was a pro, Groucho was, and I did right by him; I modulated that pitch 
myself.</p>

<p><b>Rated R</b>.  Contains profanity, and real and simulated persons behaving badly.</p>

The studio audience laughed loudly, as it always did when Groucho 
turned, in mock desperation or annoyance, to his long-suffering, 
hopelessly square announcer.  Groucho's voice slightly increased in 
pitch whenever he said Fennemanrsquo;s name, as if he were just at the edge 
of losing his celebrated cool.  This half-squawk had been funny in the 
stateroom scene of A Night at the Opera ("Steward!  Steward!"), and 
it was still funny on You Bet Your Life twenty-five years later.  He 
was a pro, Groucho was, and I did right by him; I modulated that pitch 
myself.

Rated R.  Contains profanity, and real and simulated persons behaving badly.

shadow.  I don&#8217;t work with the children, who are on the lower floors
and the sheltered playground of the courtyard, but toil away with
records on the upper floors.  Unlike Jamin or Zel, I am permitted by
the job to work alongside women, but only because I completed my

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sorry folks.  I know that EP is getting to the point where it&#8217;s <em>usually</em> late these days, but today it&#8217;s going to be a bit later than usual.  There are a few good reasons for it &#8212; some related to the content itself, and some related to things going on with me &#8212; but it would be inappropriate for me to go into all of it right this moment.  We&#8217;re <em>not</em> skipping a week, and I&#8217;m fairly certain EP170 will be posted by noon today.</p>

<p>In the meantime, by way of apology and spurred by some demand for it in the forums, here&#8217;s a minor bonus for those interested: the raw, mostly unedited recording session from Dr. Bowie&#8217;s and my reading of &#8220;How I Mounted Goldie, Saved My Partner Lori, and Sniffed Out the People&#8217;s Justice&#8221; last week.  If you enjoy knowing how the sausage gets made, this particular file is a slightly more entertaining example than most.  This isn&#8217;t going into the feed, because it isn&#8217;t really an Escape Pod episode; you&#8217;ll have to either listen in the browser, or right-click on it and download it yourself if you want to hear it.</p>

<p><em>First, there’s the pressure.</p>

<p>A special kind of pressure, high under Tara’s chin, that makes her feel heavy and light all at once. She kneels by the chair and leans across the edge, because if she faints, the chair will roll away and she won’t choke. She’s always careful.</p>

<p>After the pressure she gets dizzy, and her vision gets kind of… narrow, dark around the edges. It’s hard to breathe, and it feels like there’s something stuck in her throat. Prickles run up and down her back, down her arms where the pain used to be, and a warm fluid kind of feeling sloshes around inside her. She slides down, as things get dark, and then she starts to dream.</p>

<p>But not like night time dreams. These are special.</em></p>

<p><strong>Rated R.</strong> Contains children engaging in extremely dangerous practices. Parental guidance STRONGLY recommended.</p>

<p><em>I smiled, admiring her strength and her energy. Monty scowled. &#8220;Take that puppy-dog-in-love look off your face. It&#8217;s embarrassing.

Read by Anna Eley.
First appeared in Bruce Coville's Book of Aliens II, ed. Bruce Coville.

Jenny was silent for a while. "Promise me something?" she finally asked. "If they ever come for you, promise you'll let me know?"

"Why?" I had trouble believing Jenny really wanted to leave. Maybe this was all some sort of joke.

"Just promise," Jenny said.

"No." Even if she was serious, Jenny was the last person I wanted following me into space.

Jenny took a deep breath. "I'll tell you, too. If they ever come for me."

Rated G.  This is a young adult SF story.
