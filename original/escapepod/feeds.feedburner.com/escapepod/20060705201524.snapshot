<p><b><a href="http://www.davidwaltonfiction.com/">By David Walton</a>.</b><br />
Read by J.R. Blackwell (of <a href="http://www.365tomorrows.com">365 Tomorrows</a> and <a href="http://voicesoftomorrow.libsyn.com">Voices of Tomorrow</a>).</p>

<p><i>In the center of the room, on a platform, was our Dokja&#8211;not the humanoid body she took in VR, but a blue mass of flesh with dry fish-like skin that pulsated as she breathed.  She had no definitive shape, no arms or legs or tentacles, or even a face.  Her only prominent feature was a taut membrane stretched tightly over an opening at the top of her body.  One section of that membrane was covered over with an elaborate breathing apparatus, and the familiar array of VR electrodes were attached to what must have been her central nervous system.</p>

<p></i><i>I felt ill just looking at her.  But I knew therapy would readjust my feelings.</i></p>

<p><b>Rated PG</b>.  Contains innuendo and some violence. </p>

It worked fine when I tested it, but Feedburner must have changed something at some later point.  I’m sorry for the confusion two weeks in a row, and my apologies if you get this story twice.)

By David Walton.
Read by J.R. Blackwell (of 365 Tomorrows and Voices of Tomorrow).

In the center of the room, on a platform, was our Dokja–not the humanoid body she took in VR, but a blue mass of flesh with dry fish-like skin that pulsated as she breathed.  She had no definitive shape, no arms or legs or tentacles, or even a face.  Her only prominent feature was a taut membrane stretched tightly over an opening at the top of her body.  One section of that membrane was covered over with an elaborate breathing apparatus, and the familiar array of VR electrodes were attached to what must have been her central nervous system.

I felt ill just looking at her.  But I knew therapy would readjust my feelings.

Rated PG.  Contains innuendo and some violence.

I don’t know where I was when Kennedy was shot. I don’t know what I was doing when the World Trade Center collapsed under the onslaught of two jetliners. But I remember every single detail, every minute, every second, of the day we got the bad news.

“It may not be Alzheimer’s,” said Dr. Castleman. “Alzheimer’s is becoming a catchword for a variety of senile dementias. Eventually we’ll find out exactly which dementia it is, but there’s no question that Gwendolyn is suffering from one of them.”

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://boingboing.net">BoingBoing</a> recently broke <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/05/22/u_florida_cops_ask_f.html">this story</a>, which is something anyone who is interested in genre fiction needs to take interest in. A University of Florida graduate student wrote a horror story on his LiveJournal which got the interest of the university police. They have been harassing him for his fingerprints and DNA so they can try to match him to other murders. The unstoppable force that is Cory Doctorow got involved, calling and investigating, with the police quite unwilling to discuss the situation, although they chose to use Doctorow&#8217;s interest in the situation as more ammo with which to threaten the student. There is no case. There are no charges. And yet they won&#8217;t lay off this guy. </p>

<p>Writing is not a crime. Writing about bad things is not a crime. Being an unpublished writer, writing about bad things, is not a crime. (Notice no one going after big time authors.)</p>

<p>**</p>

<p>In other news. <a href="http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?id=36225">SciFi Wire</a> reports that Dabel Brothers Productions will start adapting some popular SFF novels to graphic novels. If they do it half as well as Mike Carey and Glenn Fabry are depicting Neil Gaiman&#8217;s <em><a href="http://www.dccomics.com/comics/?cm=5050">Neverwhere</a></em>, look to see some good stuff. The first three titles up will be Orson Scott Card&#8217;s <em>Red Prophet</em> and <em>Wyrms</em> and Laurel K. Hamilton&#8217;s <em>Anita Blake</em> book, <em>Guilty Pleasures</em>.</p>

<p>[EDIT- these are not the first titles, these are the first of a new batch. They&#8217;ve been doing this with other titles already. Thanks for the comment, John!]</p>

<p>The blogosphere was <a href="http://coffeeandink.livejournal.com/588823.html">on fire yesterday</a> with the news that apparently a piece of fanfiction (&#8221;Arcana&#8221; by Emily Brunson - the work has since been removed from the web) was on the long list for this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tiptree.org/">Tiptree Award</a> (1). There are, of course, strong opinions on either side. Fanfic has been looked down upon for years - it&#8217;s a copyright violation (which is true), it&#8217;s not &#8220;real writing&#8221; (not quite so true), it takes no skill (untrue) and there&#8217;s a lot of crap out there (true of any art). The other side, well, they just argue the opposite. I (2) realized that there&#8217;s a fine line - if someone hires you to write, it&#8217;s no longer fanfic. But what&#8217;s the difference between a Star Wars fanfic and a Star Wars novel? Money, licensing, permission, and perhaps skill. I write professional fanfic when I write in established RPG worlds. I&#8217;ve written World of Warcraft fanfic and Exalted fanfic, technically. </p>

<p>However, the sticky situation comes up when you realize if the piece had won, then the author would have received things such as chocolate, a trip to the award ceremony at WisCon, and&#8230; money. That&#8217;s right. The author would have received money, making the &#8220;homage&#8221; copyright violation (something that&#8217;s usually accepted online) into a definite illegal commercial copyright violation. </p>

<p>People are questioning the credibility of the judges, as fanfic isn&#8217;t even considered &#8220;published&#8221;, was the piece good enough, should it be judged on writing or just gender exploration, etc. It&#8217;s an interesting situation. I have to admit that my opinion of fanfic has changed in the past years, but I&#8217;m still firmly in the camp that it should be seen as a hobby that hones writing skill and is fun to do, not something you can publish, no matter how good it is. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>Just a quick heads-up that due to a last minute technical issue (that I&#8217;m too annoyed at myself to describe), today&#8217;s Escape Pod will be posted sometime this afternoon.</p>

<p>Our official release schedule is &#8220;Sometime Thursday,&#8221; so strictly speaking this doesn&#8217;t make us late.  However, I know that many of you are used to getting the files in the morning, and for those of you who&#8217;ll miss having it for these few hours, I apologize.  </p>

<p>If all goes well it&#8217;ll be the first of our Hugo nominees, so hopefully it&#8217;ll be worth the wait.  And my new job schedule <i>should</i> mean this is the last time I stay up this late to get things done.</p>

<p>Thanks for your understanding!</p>

Our official release schedule is “Sometime Thursday,” so strictly speaking this doesn’t make us late.  However, I know that many of you are used to getting the files in the morning, and for those of you who’ll miss having it for these few hours, I apologize.  

If all goes well it’ll be the first of our Hugo nominees, so hopefully it’ll be worth the wait.  And my new job schedule should mean this is the last time I stay up this late to get things done.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Summer Brooks, Producer of <a href="http://www.dragonpage.com">The Dragon Page</a> podcasts, reports that this Saturday they will be doing something new with Cover to Cover. </p>

<blockquote>We will be recording the next &#8220;Cover to Cover&#8221; feature on Saturday, May 13th, beginning at 10:30am Pacific Time.

What makes this different is that we&#8217;ll be talking with 3 authors from Edge Publications, and you&#8217;ll be able to call in with questions and comments during and after their roundtable discussion.

Rebecca Rowe (&#8221;Forbidden Cargo&#8221;), Lynda Williams (&#8221;Courtesan Prince&#8221;, &#8220;Throne Prince&#8221;, &#8220;Righteous Anger&#8221;), and Australian author and Borealis winner K.A. Bedford (&#8221;Orbital&#8221;, &#8220;Eclipse&#8221;, &#8220;Hydrogen Steel&#8221;) will be talking about their books, all of which have something to do with genetic modification and the use of nanotechnology in humans.

Listeners will be able to hear the feed here:
<a href="http://haven.homelinux.net:12346/listen.pls">http://haven.homelinux.net:12346/listen.pls</a>

Australian listeners can catch a feed closer to home:
<a href="http://stream.froosh.net:8000/wingin_it.m3u">http://stream.froosh.net:8000/wingin_it.m3u</a>

We are in the process of adding another server, so keep an eye out here, and in the new IRC channel #dragonpage for more news.

Both IRC channels #dragonpage and #wingin_it are available at irc.freenode.net</blockquote>

<p>Leave it to Michael and Evo and the Kick Ass Mystic Ninjas to fiddle with the possibilities of the awesomeness of podcasting. If you&#8217;ve got some time Saturday, check it out.</p>

<p>And for those of you (us) who are unable to make it to WorldCon, instead of gnashing your teeth and beating your breast, why not snuggle down with the free e-book of James Patrick Kelly&#8217;s nominated work, <em>Burn</em>? If you missed the podcast (shame on you, it was fantastic) then you can still get it for free through e-book (you can still download all the chapters through podcast, if you want to hear Jim&#8217;s voice telling the story in his compelling way.) All information <a href="http://jimkelly.net">on his site</a>. </p>

<p>And then, of course, you have at least four of the five nominated short stories available here on Escape Pod starting this week!</p>
