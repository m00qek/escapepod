<p><i>Other dragons cavorted on the airy currents. Those dragons were cherry red or lime green or creamy brown. Their riders steered them up the beach, or inland toward the mall, or back to campus.</i></p>

<p><i>A slender girl on a pink dragon passed us going the opposite way, her blond hair billowing. Matt waved to her. He said over his shoulder, “I met that girl last night. Hold on, I want to say hi.” He yanked the reins and we banked sharply. My stomach lurched. We swept around in an arc and came up alongside the girl. Her dragon had the guileless beady eyes and scrunched up cheeks of a lap dog. Matt said, “Hi. Dora, right?”</i></p>

<p><i>“Deirdre,” she corrected. “And you’re &#8230; Matt?” He grinned, and she said, “I like your dragon.”</i></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I announced this in the intro to <a href="http://www.escapepod.org/2006/12/28/ep086-when-we-went-to-see-the-end-of-the-world/">last week&#8217;s episode</a>, but got distracted and didn&#8217;t put it into written form here.  Until now.</p>

<p>With the aid of an anonymous donor, Escape Pod is presenting a contest for <b>the best SF story of 300 words or less</b>.  There are no restrictions on theme, plot, or structure.  The goal is simply to present a strong idea-based story in the minimum space possible.
<a id="more-185"></a></p>

<p>To enter, simply send your name, address, and the title and story to <a href="mailto:contest@escapepod.org">contest@escapepod.org</a>.  Please look at our <a href="http://www.escapepod.org/guidelines">submission guidelines</a> for formatting instructions.  This is effectively an Escape Pod story submission; only the selection process is different.  Please send a <i>maximum</i> of three stories to us.  If you happen to have a trunk full of really short pieces, select your three best.</p>

<p>After you&#8217;ve sent your story, I&#8217;ll strip your name from it and post it to a members-only area on the <a href="http://forum.escapeartists.info">Escape Pod forum</a>.  Because it won&#8217;t be publicly viewable or searchable, it shouldn&#8217;t count as &#8216;published&#8217; by anyone&#8217;s guidelines, and you&#8217;ll retain all rights to the story.  Interested forum members will be able to review the stories and comment on them.  On February 1, I&#8217;ll create a poll (or a series of polls, if there are too many entries) and invite people to select their favorites.  </p>

<p>The highest-rated story will receive an Escape Pod contract to run their story as flash fiction at a rate of $100.  That&#8217;s five times our standard flash rate.</p>

<p>The second-highest rated story will receive a contract at a rate of $50.  </p>

<p>The third-highest rated story will receive a standard flash contract, and so will any others that I, as EP&#8217;s editor, think are excellent choices for Escape Pod.</p>

<p>The stories will then be produced in audio and will go out on Escape Pod&#8217;s feed, and be made available for any other non-commercial use as specified in our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/">Creative Commons  license</a>.</p>

<p><b>The deadline is January 31, 2007.</b>  Anything we receive after that will be forwarded back to our usual submissions process.</p>

<p>Sound like fun?  Any questions?  </p>

<p>Go to it, and we look forward to seeing your (very short) work!</p>

<p><i>I launched into my next bit, which I&#8217;d rehearsed that morning on the tram. &#8220;What I liked about your stories is that you never knew where they were going. It&#8217;d start off as a World War II military adventure, but then it would wind up being about android worms from another dimension out to steal Earth&#8217;s dirt. It&#8217;s like other writers&#8217; stories are bridges: There&#8217;s a beginning, there&#8217;s an end, and it&#8217;s a pretty straight shot through. It might be a long bridge, or curvy, maybe, so you can&#8217;t quite see the ending coming. But the trip basically makes sense. Your stories were different, though. You always blew up your bridges halfway across, and you&#8217;d have to swim for the banks, and you&#8217;d end up on some rock with weird lizards.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>On the verge of laughter, he looked at me. &#8220;You&#8217;re kidding, right?&#8221;</i></p>

“What I’m trying to do, Marcus, is talk that tree into moving.”

Marcus didn’t say anything. He stood behind someone he thought he once knew and tried to figure what to say next. Not a man normally tied for words, Marcus found himself in the very surreal position of being speechless.

Rated R.  For profanity and somewhat wooden anatomical descriptions.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As promised in the past couple of episodes, our online storefront for selling podcast archive CDs is (finally!) up and running at <a href="http://poddisc.com">PodDisc.com</a>.  This is your chance to get all of your holiday shopping done in one place &#8212; provided everyone you know wants over 45 hours of science fiction short stories on CD.</p>

<p>What do the discs look like?  I&#8217;m glad you asked.  They look like this:</p>

<p><img src='/media/EP_Collection3.jpg' alt='Escape Pod Collection 3' width='350' height='350' /></p>

<p>Beautiful, isn&#8217;t it?  And for a very slight fee, you can have your own personal message put on the CD.  You can buy each disc for $10 or a bundle of all three collections for $25.  Shipping is a cheap flat rate in the U.S. (and tolerable everywhere else), and satisfaction is guaranteed.</p>

<p>Right now only Escape Pod CDs are available, but once the business model proves viable I plan to open this up to producing archive discs for other podcasters.  If that&#8217;s a service you&#8217;d be interested in, <a href="mailto:eley@escapeartists.info">drop me a line</a> and I&#8217;ll give you more details.  </p>

<p><i>And remember:</i> If you&#8217;ve donated $20 or more to Escape Pod this year, or if you&#8217;re a subscriber, don&#8217;t buy yet!  I&#8217;ll be sending details to you in e-mail on how you can get this stuff for free.  </p>

<p>&#8230;Right after I get some sleep.</p>

Read by Rich Sigfrit (of <a href="http://www.requiemoftheoutcast.com/">Requiem of the Outcast</a> and <a href="http://www.requiemoftheoutcast.com/pulp/">Amazing Pulp Adventures</a>).</p>

<p><i>&#8220;Which one are you?&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>The kid fans out a small stack of super hero trading cards, but it&#8217;s not a Union deck. Figures. &#8220;Lemme see what you got there.&#8221; I flip through and remember my old baseball card collection. I knew there was something special about me, when at nine-years-old, I accurately calculated the probable batting stats of each player, on every team, in the 1996 season after opening only one pack. The Union recruited me five years later after my dad beat a couple of Atlantic City casinos for ten million bucks. I was caught on security camera tape telling him when and how to bet at the roulette wheel.</i></p>

<p><i>&#8220;These don&#8217;t look like you.&#8221;</i><i></p>

<p></i><i>The card displays a blue-costumed man leaping between buildings. I hand it back to him. &#8220;Those guys aren&#8217;t real, but I am.&#8221; Wow. Did I just say that? Maybe I&#8217;ll tell the kid that Santa and the Easter Bunny aren&#8217;t real either. He&#8217;s staring at me now, I can almost see his little brain struggling to make sense of my answer. I should tell him to buy Union Cards but, you know, he&#8217;s five.</i></p>

“Which one are you?”

The kid fans out a small stack of super hero trading cards, but it’s not a Union deck. Figures. “Lemme see what you got there.” I flip through and remember my old baseball card collection. I knew there was something special about me, when at nine-years-old, I accurately calculated the probable batting stats of each player, on every team, in the 1996 season after opening only one pack. The Union recruited me five years later after my dad beat a couple of Atlantic City casinos for ten million bucks. I was caught on security camera tape telling him when and how to bet at the roulette wheel.

“These don’t look like you.”

The card displays a blue-costumed man leaping between buildings. I hand it back to him. “Those guys aren’t real, but I am.” Wow. Did I just say that? Maybe I’ll tell the kid that Santa and the Easter Bunny aren’t real either. He’s staring at me now, I can almost see his little brain struggling to make sense of my answer. I should tell him to buy Union Cards but, you know, he’s five.

Rated R.  Contains profanity, some violence involving children, and retail corporate exploitation.
