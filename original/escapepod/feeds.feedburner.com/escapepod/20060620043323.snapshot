Generally speaking, I need only three minutes of concentrated attention to kill someone by staring at them.  If I’m feeling under the weather, or my mind is preoccupied with other matters–you know how your mind can obsess about trivial things sometimes–it might take five minutes for my power to have its effect.  On the other hand, if I focus intensely on my victim I can get the job done in as little as ninety seconds.

…Now the nation is at war.  Or so we’re told.  I guess that changes everything.  A person like me becomes much more important.

Rated R.  Contains violence, some sexual content, and disturbing themes.

This makes me want to send a note back in time to my 15 year old self and say, “Just be patient. It will come.”

A University of Florida graduate student wrote a horror story on his LiveJournal which got the interest of the university police. They have been harassing him for his fingerprints and DNA so they can try to match him to other murders. The unstoppable force that is Cory Doctorow got involved, calling and investigating, with the police quite unwilling to discuss the situation, although they chose to use Doctorow&#8217;s interest in the situation as more ammo with which to threaten the student. There is no case. There are no charges. And yet they won&#8217;t lay off this guy. </p>

<p>Writing is not a crime. Writing about bad things is not a crime. Being an unpublished writer, writing about bad things, is not a crime. (Notice no one going after big time authors.)</p>

<p>In other news. <a href="http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?id=36225">SciFi Wire</a> reports that Dabel Brothers Productions will start adapting some popular SFF novels to graphic novels. If they do it half as well as Mike Carey and Glenn Fabry are depicting Neil Gaiman&#8217;s <em><a href="http://www.dccomics.com/comics/?cm=5050">Neverwhere</a></em>, look to see some good stuff. The first three titles up will be Orson Scott Card&#8217;s <em>Red Prophet</em> and <em>Wyrms</em> and Laurel K. Hamilton&#8217;s <em>Anita Blake</em> book, <em>Guilty Pleasures</em>.</p>

<p>[EDIT- these are not the first titles, these are the first of a new batch. They&#8217;ve been doing this with other titles already. Thanks for the comment, John!]</p>

<p>The blogosphere was <a href="http://coffeeandink.livejournal.com/588823.html">on fire yesterday</a> with the news that apparently a piece of fanfiction (&#8221;Arcana&#8221; by Emily Brunson - the work has since been removed from the web) was on the long list for this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tiptree.org/">Tiptree Award</a> (1). There are, of course, strong opinions on either side. Fanfic has been looked down upon for years - it&#8217;s a copyright violation (which is true), it&#8217;s not &#8220;real writing&#8221; (not quite so true), it takes no skill (untrue) and there&#8217;s a lot of crap out there (true of any art). The other side, well, they just argue the opposite. I (2) realized that there&#8217;s a fine line - if someone hires you to write, it&#8217;s no longer fanfic. But what&#8217;s the difference between a Star Wars fanfic and a Star Wars novel? Money, licensing, permission, and perhaps skill. I write professional fanfic when I write in established RPG worlds. I&#8217;ve written World of Warcraft fanfic and Exalted fanfic, technically. </p>

<p>However, the sticky situation comes up when you realize if the piece had won, then the author would have received things such as chocolate, a trip to the award ceremony at WisCon, and&#8230; money. That&#8217;s right. The author would have received money, making the &#8220;homage&#8221; copyright violation (something that&#8217;s usually accepted online) into a definite illegal commercial copyright violation. </p>

<p>People are questioning the credibility of the judges, as fanfic isn&#8217;t even considered &#8220;published&#8221;, was the piece good enough, should it be judged on writing or just gender exploration, etc. It&#8217;s an interesting situation. I have to admit that my opinion of fanfic has changed in the past years, but I&#8217;m still firmly in the camp that it should be seen as a hobby that hones writing skill and is fun to do, not something you can publish, no matter how good it is. </p>

He pointed to her handheld. “You say you have my argument in there.”

“I do. And I find it specious.”

Rated G.  Contains politics and reference to moral issues.  (Your kids may not get it, but it shouldn’t offend.)

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>Just a quick heads-up that due to a last minute technical issue (that I&#8217;m too annoyed at myself to describe), today&#8217;s Escape Pod will be posted sometime this afternoon.</p>

<p>Our official release schedule is &#8220;Sometime Thursday,&#8221; so strictly speaking this doesn&#8217;t make us late.  However, I know that many of you are used to getting the files in the morning, and for those of you who&#8217;ll miss having it for these few hours, I apologize.  </p>

<p>If all goes well it&#8217;ll be the first of our Hugo nominees, so hopefully it&#8217;ll be worth the wait.  And my new job schedule <i>should</i> mean this is the last time I stay up this late to get things done.</p>

<p>Thanks for your understanding!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Summer Brooks, Producer of <a href="http://www.dragonpage.com">The Dragon Page</a> podcasts, reports that this Saturday they will be doing something new with Cover to Cover. </p>

<blockquote>We will be recording the next &#8220;Cover to Cover&#8221; feature on Saturday, May 13th, beginning at 10:30am Pacific Time.

What makes this different is that we&#8217;ll be talking with 3 authors from Edge Publications, and you&#8217;ll be able to call in with questions and comments during and after their roundtable discussion.

Rebecca Rowe (&#8221;Forbidden Cargo&#8221;), Lynda Williams (&#8221;Courtesan Prince&#8221;, &#8220;Throne Prince&#8221;, &#8220;Righteous Anger&#8221;), and Australian author and Borealis winner K.A. Bedford (&#8221;Orbital&#8221;, &#8220;Eclipse&#8221;, &#8220;Hydrogen Steel&#8221;) will be talking about their books, all of which have something to do with genetic modification and the use of nanotechnology in humans.

Listeners will be able to hear the feed here:
<a href="http://haven.homelinux.net:12346/listen.pls">http://haven.homelinux.net:12346/listen.pls</a>

Australian listeners can catch a feed closer to home:
<a href="http://stream.froosh.net:8000/wingin_it.m3u">http://stream.froosh.net:8000/wingin_it.m3u</a>

We are in the process of adding another server, so keep an eye out here, and in the new IRC channel #dragonpage for more news.

Both IRC channels #dragonpage and #wingin_it are available at irc.freenode.net</blockquote>

<p>Leave it to Michael and Evo and the Kick Ass Mystic Ninjas to fiddle with the possibilities of the awesomeness of podcasting. If you&#8217;ve got some time Saturday, check it out.</p>
