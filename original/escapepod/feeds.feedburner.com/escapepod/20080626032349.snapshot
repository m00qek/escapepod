<em>Special closing music:</em> &#8220;Think For Yourself&#8221; by <a href="http://geologicrecords.net">George Hrab</a>.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you necessarily think it leads to the Chrono area,&#8221; Monty said, playing devil&#8217;s advocate. It was a month earlier, at the usual place: The Trotsky, a damp, dark watering hole in a run-down part of town which, rumour had it, was once visited by the man himself, in his own dark, yet colourful, past.
</em></p>

<p><em>&#8220;Where else would it lead, man?&#8221; Morgan sparked up a joint and stared at him across the table. The smoke framed her face like the shape of a heart. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be here –&#8221; she waved her finger at him, &#8220;and you wouldn&#8217;t be here, if it wasn&#8217;t something both of our respective organisations thought was worth pursuing.&#8221;
</em></p>

<p><em>I smiled, admiring her strength and her energy. Monty scowled. &#8220;Take that puppy-dog-in-love look off your face. It&#8217;s embarrassing. And you,&#8221; he said, addressing Morgan, &#8220;should know better than to get your hopes up. After all, as the saying goes, they only ever bring back Shakespeare.&#8221;

<p><i>When you&#8217;re as old as I am, you&#8217;ll find your memory&#8217;s not what it was. It&#8217;s not that you lose memories. That hasn&#8217;t happened to me or anyone else since the Paleocosmic Era, the Old Space Age, when people lived in caves on the Moon. My trouble is that I&#8217;ve gained memories, and I don&#8217;t know which of them are real. I was very casual about memory storage back then, I seem to recall.

<p><i>Some of the tales about me contradict each other, or couldn&#8217;t possibly have happened, because that&#8217;s how I told them in the first place. Others I blame on the writers and tellers.

First appeared in <a href="http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0805/Distantreplay.shtml">Asimov&#8217;s Science Fiction</a>, April/May 2007.</p>

<p><i>That Winter, Will le Fey held down a job working for a haint politician named Salem Toussaint. Chiefly, his function was to run errands while looking conspicuously solid. He fetched tax forms for the alderman’s constituents, delivered stacks of documents to trollish functionaries, fixed L&amp;I violations, presented boxes of candied John-the-Conqueror root to retiring secretaries, absent-mindedly dropped slim envelopes containing twenty-dollar bills on desks. When somebody important died, he brought a white goat to the back door of the Fane of Darkness to be sacrificed to the Nameless One. When somebody else’s son was drafted or went to prison, he hammered a nail in the nkisi nkonde that Toussaint kept in the office to ensure his safe return.</i></p>

<p><i>He canvassed voters in haint neighborhoods like Ginny Gall, Beluthahatchie, and Diddy-Wah-Diddy, where the bars were smoky, the music was good, and it was dangerous to smile at the whores.

Closing Music: &#8220;Juzt Mizunderztood&#8221; by <a href="http://www.normansherman.com/">Norm Sherman</a>.</p>

<p><i>My head throbs. I think about the mess in the fridge, the heaps of crap in the flat while I force the clumps of wet clothes into the dryers.</i></p>

<p><i>As far as I know I am the only Union member who works outside the system, the only one tasked specifically with fighting crime, secretly, of course. Darksider put the program together with one of the Luminaries as a way to explore expanding our role in the maintenance of Normal society. He chose me specifically because I am the only super-agile who is also an orphan. Therefore, I won&#8217;t be tempted to throw my costume in a dumpster and make a break for mom and dad.</i></p>

<p><i>Communication with the Union ended seven months ago. Darksider was supposed to make sure that a stipend was deposited into a bank account under my phony name every month. But that stopped too. I don&#8217;t know why. I tried everything to make contact short of walking up to the Boston Pyramid and knocking. Not that it would have done any good since none of the regular Union knows I even exist. </i></p>

<p><b>Rated R</b>.  Contains sordid occupations, drug use, and violence.  Welcome to the city.</p>

Closing music: &#8220;I Crush Everything&#8221; by <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com">Jonathan Coulton</a>.</p>

<p><i>I spent the longest five weeks of my life in that tank and in a deeper pool, healing, testing, practicing.  My feet and toes had been augmented much like my hands, my thighs shortened to maximize the available muscle.  I was damned quick.  Relearning construction techniques with my new fingers was sometimes frustrating, yet my progress was real and those periods of solitary labor became important to me.</i></p>

<p><i>At the surface, in the shallows, doctors poked and prodded and put me through redundant tortures.  I had been warned that the study of my new body would be extensive and did my best not to fear or hate them, but I&#8217;d never imagined such intense scrutiny.  During my years as a SEAL, I had been like a bug under a microscope, constantly evaluated and scored.  Here I was the microscope, my body the only lens through which they could measure their work.  Stenstrom tried to be my buddy, as he had always tried, joking and asking what I&#8217;d do with the money, yet his possessiveness was obvious.  &#8220;We&#8217;ll be famous,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll change the world.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>I wasn&#8217;t a slave or a pet, exactly, but I was anxious to get started.  To get away from them.</i></p>

<p><b>Rated PG</b>.  Contains moderate violence.</p>

First appeared in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0972054774/escapepod-20">All-Star Zeppelin Adventure Stories</a> (ed. David Moles &amp; Jay Lake).</p>

<p><i>We are somewhere among the tallest mountains of the world. When we arrived, I was locked away in a cargo hold, so I don’t know exactly where. Our home is a small, drafty castle and a separate laboratory. Dr. Octavio had the locals construct the lab before he tested the new death ray on their village. There&#8217;s very little left there. In my little bit of spare time, I try to bury the bodies and collect anything useful to the doctor’s experiment.</i></p>

<p><i>My primary duties consist of keeping the castle&#8217;s furnace running and clearing the never-ending snow from the path between the two buildings. Sometimes, it falls too fast for my slow treads and shovel attachment to keep up with and I find myself half-buried in the snow. It is horrible on my gears when this happens, but I use heavyweight oil now and it helps.</i></p>

<p><i>It is one of the few benefits of my metal frame that I appreciate. Life in this contraption is like being wrapped in swaddling clothes. I wonder if I would feel anything if my casing caught on fire? I need to ask the doctor when he isn’t in one of his moods.</i></p>

<p><i>Gruen was on the sixty-first master, and while his wisdom had

well-preserved&#8211;the palms of his three-fingered hands still sported the
deep, swirling ridges that had worn to nothing in most people before
they&#8217;d lived thirty years.  Indeed, all of the myriad folds and ridges
in his thick maroon skin were for the most part intact.  His eyes were
still housed in tight sockets, surrounded by thickly-ridged cheeks.
Besides the feet, the eyes were the greatest point of weakness for those
who aspired to read the works of the masters.  Ceaseless up-and-down eye
movement caused the sockets to wear out, and eventually the reader&#8217;s
eyes fell out.  At that point they were forced to trace the carved words
with their fingers.  Friction quickly took its toll on the hands;
readers rarely made it through one master&#8217;s teachings this way before
their hands were ground to the wrist, and they were finished.</i></p>

they'd lived thirty years.  Indeed, all of the myriad folds and ridges

Closing Music: "O Come All Ye Faithful," performed by Twisted Sister.

Gloria blinked. "Why do the people in Cleveland love Christmas more than anywhere else?"

Toby grinned and spread his hands on the bar, unadorned fingers splayed. He stared at them,  "I didn't say Cleveland's people loved Christmas. I said Cleveland."

"And you're saying Charlotte doesn't like Christmas?"

Toby took a deep breath and let it out. "Oh, no. I'm saying Charlotte flat out hates Christmas."

Gloria kept her voice level, the best thing to do when dealing with a crazy person. "And why do you think this?"

"I'm an urban shaman. A citytalker. I'm here to talk to Charlotte to find out why it's unhappy."

Rated PG.  Contains moderate violence and stronger weather.

<p><i>Survivors isn&#8217;t exactly the word. What they found were sixteen bodies without arms, legs, and most organs.

<p><i>There was no hesitation on the part of Command.  They ordered everyone, except combat types like us, from the most likely targets.  Humanity couldn&#8217;t allow any more people to become components for the Shardie offense.</i></p>

<p><i>But civilians never listen.  Farmers were the worse, hanging onto their little plots and crops until somebody dragged them away, kicking and screaming at the injustice of it all.  That&#8217;s why we were here.  Forty settlers had stupidly refused to be evacuated from New Mars. Forty we didn&#8217;t know about until we got that one brief burst.</i></p>

<p><i>My mission was to make certain that they didn&#8217;t become forty armless, legless, gutless, screamless weapon components.</i></p>

<p><i>Which is why she was hoping that the venture capitalist would just leave her alone. He wasn&#8217;t a paying customer, he wasn&#8217;t a fellow artist &#8212; he wanted to *buy* her, and he was thirty years too late.</i></p>

<p><i>&#8220;You know, I pitched you guys in 1999. On Sand Hill Road. One of the founding partners. Kleiner, I think. The guy ate a salad all through my slide-deck. When I was done, he wiped his mouth, looked over my shoulder, and told me he didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d scale. That was it. He didn&#8217;t even pick up my business card. When I looked back as I was going out the door, I saw his sweep it into the trash with the wrapper from his sandwich.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>The VC &#8212; young, with the waxy, sweaty look of someone who ate a lot of GM yogurt to try to patch his biochemistry &#8212; shook his head. &#8220;That wasn&#8217;t us. We&#8217;re a franchise &#8212; based here in LA. I just opened up the Inglewood branch. But I can see how that would have soured you on us. Did you ever get your VC?&#8221;</i></p>

		<itunes:summary>By Cory Doctorow.
Read by Amanda Fitzwater.
First appeared in Forbes Magazine, October 2007.

Which is why she was hoping that the venture capitalist would just leave her alone. He wasn't a paying customer, he wasn't a fellow artist -- he wanted to *buy* her, and he was thirty years too late.

"You know, I pitched you guys in 1999. On Sand Hill Road. One of the founding partners. Kleiner, I think. The guy ate a salad all through my slide-deck. When I was done, he wiped his mouth, looked over my shoulder, and told me he didn't think I'd scale. That was it. He didn't even pick up my business card. When I looked back as I was going out the door, I saw his sweep it into the trash with the wrapper from his sandwich."

The VC -- young, with the waxy, sweaty look of someone who ate a lot of GM yogurt to try to patch his biochemistry -- shook his head. "That wasn't us. We're a franchise -- based here in LA. I just opened up the Inglewood branch. But I can see how that would have soured you on us. Did you ever get your VC?"

Rated G.  Contains Byzantine finance and potentially disturbing art.

<p><i>&#8220;We&#8217;re all committing a crime,&#8221; Audra said, leaning back and closing her eyes.  &#8220;That&#8217;s part of what we&#8217;re paying you for.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>Technically, she was right.  Extreme Safaris took their clients to unsanctioned or dangerous worlds, trips which could result in serious fines or, in Bryer&#8217;s case, the loss of his ship&#8217;s clearance for those areas.  So far, Bryer had managed to avoid the fines simply by having his clients sign a document that said they had insisted on a trip to the unsanctioned area.  He had never had his clearance removed, but he figured it wouldn&#8217;t be a serious problem.  He could always charter another ship.</i></p>

<p><i>&#8220;You shot a sentient being,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t pay for that right.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>&#8220;Oh?&#8221; She tilted her head toward him.  &#8220;Is there a higher fee for that?&#8221;</i></p>
