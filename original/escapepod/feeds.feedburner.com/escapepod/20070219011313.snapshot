Read by Matthew Wayne Selznick (of <a href="http://www.bravemenrun.com/">Brave Men Run</a> and <a href="http://www.fiveminutememoir.com">Five Minute Memoir</a>).<br />
First appeared in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375829636/escapepod-20">Young Warriors</a>, ed. Tamora Pierce &amp; Josepha Sherman.</p>

<p><i>Now, this Land was the home of exceptionally brave warriors 
and beautiful damsels (and occasionally they were the same person, 
since beautiful damsels were pretty assertive back then). Each 
young boy and girl was taught all the arts of warfare, and were 
soon adept with sword, mace, lance, bow and arrow, dagger, and the 
off-putting snide remark. They were schooled in horsemanship, 
camouflage, and military strategy. They learned eye-gouging, ear-biting, kidney-punching, and &#8212; since they were destined to become 
knights and ladies &#8212; gentility.</i></p>

<p><i>So successful was their training that before long enemy 
armies were afraid to attack them. Within the borders of the Land 
justice was so swift that there was not a single criminal left. It 
would have been a very peaceful and idyllic kingdom indeed &#8212; 
except for the dragons. </i></p>

<p><b>Rated G</b>.  It&#8217;s a children&#8217;s story.  Not recommended for cynical audiences.</p>

<p><i>After the first week of practice, I knew how to anticipate Mickey&#8217;s

and would inject increased levels of oxygen into his airflow when I
did. I knew that his heartbeat grew irregular when the platoon crossed
a rope bridge high over the practice-room floor, and for that exercise
I would work a calming agent into his stream. I liked to chant
patriotic slogans in his ear as we practiced. &#8220;Oh the children of
empire are marching,&#8221; I sang, &#8220;to crush the rebel threat.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>Although my programmers intended these songs to stimulate high levels

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I announced this in the intro to <a href="http://www.escapepod.org/2006/12/28/ep086-when-we-went-to-see-the-end-of-the-world/">last week&#8217;s episode</a>, but got distracted and didn&#8217;t put it into written form here.  Until now.</p>

<p>With the aid of an anonymous donor, Escape Pod is presenting a contest for <b>the best SF story of 300 words or less</b>.  There are no restrictions on theme, plot, or structure.  The goal is simply to present a strong idea-based story in the minimum space possible.
<a id="more-185"></a></p>

<p>To enter, simply send your name, address, and the title and story to <a href="mailto:contest@escapepod.org">contest@escapepod.org</a>.  Please look at our <a href="http://www.escapepod.org/guidelines">submission guidelines</a> for formatting instructions.  This is effectively an Escape Pod story submission; only the selection process is different.  Please send a <i>maximum</i> of three stories to us.  If you happen to have a trunk full of really short pieces, select your three best.</p>

<p>After you&#8217;ve sent your story, I&#8217;ll strip your name from it and post it to a members-only area on the <a href="http://forum.escapeartists.info">Escape Pod forum</a>.  Because it won&#8217;t be publicly viewable or searchable, it shouldn&#8217;t count as &#8216;published&#8217; by anyone&#8217;s guidelines, and you&#8217;ll retain all rights to the story.  Interested forum members will be able to review the stories and comment on them.  On February 1, I&#8217;ll create a poll (or a series of polls, if there are too many entries) and invite people to select their favorites.  </p>

<p>The highest-rated story will receive an Escape Pod contract to run their story as flash fiction at a rate of $100.  That&#8217;s five times our standard flash rate.</p>

<p>The second-highest rated story will receive a contract at a rate of $50.  </p>

<p>The third-highest rated story will receive a standard flash contract, and so will any others that I, as EP&#8217;s editor, think are excellent choices for Escape Pod.</p>

<p>The stories will then be produced in audio and will go out on Escape Pod&#8217;s feed, and be made available for any other non-commercial use as specified in our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/">Creative Commons  license</a>.</p>

<p><b>The deadline is January 31, 2007.</b>  Anything we receive after that will be forwarded back to our usual submissions process.</p>

<p>Sound like fun?  Any questions?  </p>

        <itunes:summary>Hi all,

I announced this in the intro to last week’s episode, but got distracted and didn’t put it into written form here.  Until now.

With the aid of an anonymous donor, Escape Pod is presenting a contest for the best SF story of 300 words or less.  There are no restrictions on theme, plot, or structure.  The goal is simply to present a strong idea-based story in the minimum space possible.


To enter, simply send your name, address, and the title and story to contest@escapepod.org.  Please look at our submission guidelines for formatting instructions.  This is effectively an Escape Pod story submission; only the selection process is different.  Please send a maximum of three stories to us.  If you happen to have a trunk full of really short pieces, select your three best.

After you’ve sent your story, I’ll strip your name from it and post it to a members-only area on the Escape Pod forum.  Because it won’t be publicly viewable or searchable, it shouldn’t count as ‘published’ by anyone’s guidelines, and you’ll retain all rights to the story.  Interested forum members will be able to review the stories and comment on them.  On February 1, I’ll create a poll (or a series of polls, if there are too many entries) and invite people to select their favorites.  

The highest-rated story will receive an Escape Pod contract to run their story as flash fiction at a rate of $100.  That’s five times our standard flash rate.

The second-highest rated story will receive a contract at a rate of $50.  

The third-highest rated story will receive a standard flash contract, and so will any others that I, as EP’s editor, think are excellent choices for Escape Pod.

The stories will then be produced in audio and will go out on Escape Pod’s feed, and be made available for any other non-commercial use as specified in our Creative Commons  license.

The deadline is January 31, 2007.  Anything we receive after that will be forwarded back to our usual submissions process.

Sound like fun?  Any questions?  

Go to it, and we look forward to seeing your (very short) work!

<p><i>I launched into my next bit, which I&#8217;d rehearsed that morning on the tram. &#8220;What I liked about your stories is that you never knew where they were going. It&#8217;d start off as a World War II military adventure, but then it would wind up being about android worms from another dimension out to steal Earth&#8217;s dirt. It&#8217;s like other writers&#8217; stories are bridges: There&#8217;s a beginning, there&#8217;s an end, and it&#8217;s a pretty straight shot through. It might be a long bridge, or curvy, maybe, so you can&#8217;t quite see the ending coming. But the trip basically makes sense. Your stories were different, though. You always blew up your bridges halfway across, and you&#8217;d have to swim for the banks, and you&#8217;d end up on some rock with weird lizards.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>On the verge of laughter, he looked at me. &#8220;You&#8217;re kidding, right?&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>That night I was faced with a major decision. I didn&#8217;t want
to read a book called </i>Travels With My Cats<i> by a woman called
Miss, but I&#8217;d spent my last nickel on it &#8212; well, the last until
my allowance came due again next week &#8212; and I&#8217;d read all my other
books so often you could almost see the eyetracks all over them.</i></p>

<p><i>So I picked it up without much enthusiasm, and read the first
page, and then the next &#8212; and suddenly I was transported to Kenya
Colony and Siam and the Amazon. Miss Priscilla Wallace had a
way of describing things that made me wish I was there, and when I
finished a section I felt like I&#8217;d </i>been<i> there.</i></p>

<p><b>Rated PG</b>.  This product may be too disillusioning for young children.</p>
