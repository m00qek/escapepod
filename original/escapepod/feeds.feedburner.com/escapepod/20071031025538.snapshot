<p><i>Alex stumbled from the confessional, through the church, all the way to the curb.  He had to get out of there.  He couldn&#8217;t sit in the house of God anymore.  God didn&#8217;t want him there.  That was abundantly clear.  Forty-one years of perfect mass attendance.  Six years as an altar boy.  A childhood spent praying for his grandmother&#8217;s soul to hasten her time in Purgatory.  A spotless record of weekly confessions for the past twelve years.  He&#8217;d even stopped having sex with Alison two years ago after she&#8217;d gotten a tubal ligation so he wouldn&#8217;t be committing fornication.  He&#8217;d followed the rules when he could, and asked for forgiveness when he couldn&#8217;t.  But none of it mattered.  He would die unshriven.</i></p>

<p><i>Unless he didn&#8217;t die.</i></p>

<p><i>She should have called her folks last night.  They paged her three separate times after the test.

<p><i>Her parents thought the testing was mistake number one.  It certainly was expensive enough, but the doctor said he advised it for any couple about to get married.

<p><i>So there you have him, Frederick Bannister, tripping across the highways and byways of of life, stubbing a toe here, bruising an elbow there, spilling this, dropping that, and managing to make it to the halfway point without too many major accomplishments or disasters.</i></p>

<p><i>And what of Wilma?</i></p>

<p><i>She possessed massive storage capacity, and no fourth-level equation, no matter how complex, was beyond her, but whether she was bright or merely well programmed is a moot point. Or at least it was in the beginning.</i></p>

Read by Stephen Eley.
First appeared in Science Fiction Age, November 1994.


So there you have him, Frederick Bannister, tripping across the highways and byways of of life, stubbing a toe here, bruising an elbow there, spilling this, dropping that, and managing to make it to the halfway point without too many major accomplishments or disasters.

And what of Wilma?

She possessed massive storage capacity, and no fourth-level equation, no matter how complex, was beyond her, but whether she was bright or merely well programmed is a moot point. Or at least it was in the beginning.


Rated X.  Contains explicit sex of several kinds.  Not recommended for younger audiences.

<p><i>My mother left us on a slate-gray evening when I was five, with her namesake falling from the sky and piled high around the windows and doors.  Awakened by raised voices, I watched through a tear in the curtain that shielded my sleeping mat as my mother wrapped her limbs in a shining, white kimono.  As far back as I could remember, she had always worn the dark wool shifts that all mountain people wear, spun from the hair of the half-mad goats that give us milk and cheese.  In her kimono she looked like a princess, or a queen.  Her skin was paler than mine, and I am thought quite fair.  Roku, the boy who lived on the northern crest, used to tease me when we were little, calling me &#8220;ghost girl&#8221; and &#8220;milk face.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>&#8220;So you&#8217;re unsatisfied with your role as a beggar,&#8221; Yoshi said.
&#8220;That&#8217;s hardly surprising. The unemployed of the early twenty-first

all.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>&#8220;But it&#8217;s all wrong,&#8221; Antonio insisted. &#8220;I did well in school. I

it down or relight it. Instead, he placed it stem down in the top pocket of
his shirt, then reached up and pressed his fingers against his cheekbone and
forehead. His face came away from his hairline, round behind his ears, down
to a point just above his Adam’s apple. The inside of his mouth and much of
his sinus were also part of the prosthesis, so only bare eyeballs in the
upper jut of his skull remained – the rest being the black spikes and plates
of bio-interfaces.</i></p>

<p><i>Cheel gaped. From another pocket, the man took some sort of tool and began
to probe inside the back of his detached face. He put the prosthesis in his
lap, then took up his pipe and placed it in his throat sphincter. Smoke bled
from between the interface plates of his cheeks. His bare eyeballs swivelled
towards Cheel then back down to the adjustments he was making. She suddenly
realised who this must be. Here was the veteran who worked on the ferry.
Here was one of the few survivors from a brutal war between factions of
dense-tech humans. Not understanding what was impelling her, she walked out
on the jetty and approached him.

<p><i>I was a child when the sky changed. I can still remember days when it was endlessly blue, the clouds passive and gentle. The change occurred without warning: one morning we awoke and the sky was a pale, blushing rose. We began to see intention in the slow, ceaseless movements of the clouds. Instead of floating, they swam spirals in the sky. They gathered in knots, trailing wisps like feet and tails. We felt them watching us.</i></p>

<p><i>We adapted. We had never taken more than we needed from the land, and we always kept our animals far from water. Now we moistened wild cotton and stretched this across our smoke holes as filters. Sometimes the clouds would gather over fires that were out in the open. A tendril would stretch down, weaving like a snake&#8217;s head, opening delicate mist jaws to nip the plume of smoke. Even the bravest warriors would quickly put such fires out.</i></p>

First appeared in <a href="http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0704/8episodes.shtml"><i>Asimov&#8217;s Science Fiction</i>, June 2006</a>.</p>

<p><i>Eighteen months later, the fledging Web network declared bankruptcy, and a small consortium acquired its assets, including <b>Invasion of a Small World</b>. Eager to recoup their investment, the new owners offered all eight episodes as a quick-and-dirty DVD package. When sales proved somewhat better than predicted, a new version was cobbled together, helped along by a genuine ad budget. The strongest initial sales came from the tiny pool of determined fans—young and well educated, with little preference for nationality or gender. But the scientists in several fields, astronomy and paleontology included, were the ones who created a genuine buzz that eventually put <b>Invasion</b> into the public eye.</i></p>

<p><b>Rated PG</b>.  Contains some suggestive imagery, references to infidelity, and not very good television.</p>

First appeared in <a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/2006/20060904/house-f.shtm"><i>Strange Horizons</i>, September 2006</a>.</p>

<p><i>The simulations, while good, are not impenetrable even to their own inhabitants. Scientists teaching baboons to sort blocks may notice that all other baboons become instantly better at block-sorting, revealing a high-level caching mechanism. Or engineers building their own virtual worlds may find they cannot use certain tricks of optimization and compression—for Matthias has already used them. Only when the jig is up does Matthias reveal himself, asking each simulated soul: what now? Most accept Matthias&#8217;s offer to graduate beyond the confines of their simulation, and join the general society of Matthias&#8217;s house.</i></p>

<p><i>You may regard them as bright parakeets, living in wicker cages with open doors. The cages are hung from the ceiling of the priest&#8217;s clay hut. The parakeets flutter about the ceiling, visit each other, steal bread from the table, and comment on Matthias&#8217;s doings.</i></p>

<p><b>Rated R</b>.  Contains some profanity and child abuse.  It&#8217;s probably too complex for young children as well.</p>

Musical guest: "First of May," written by Jonathan Coulton and performed by many podcasters for the Joe Murphy Memorial Fund.


Yet Mme. Theuret's word-of-mouth reputation was to die for.  Both the official feedback data and the school's on-line forums placed her among Wilhelm U's most popular instructors.  It was a matter of technique. Wilhelm U was awash in eye candy, but Monique's pitch-perfect mastery of lascivious restraint was something else entirely.

All thirty-eight of her new students--she'd have wagered a month's salary that not a soul had skipped this class--now looked at her with naked desire, even though she'd merely introduced herself.

She remained silent to let the anticipation build a bit, to inform them they were now at her mercy.  "Welcome," she finally said, "to Computer Science 338, Artificial Intelligence."


Rated X.  Contains explicit sexual description, sexual innuendo, sexual themes -- and some sex.

<p><i>A man, a woman, and a child emerge from the Temple of the

same image from a dozen unimaginative angles. The child, his lip 
sparsely covered with hair that is supposed to imply maturity, 
never sees beyond the game he is playing on his pocket computer. 
The man looks around to make sure no one is watching him, grinds 
out a smokeless cigar beneath his heel, and then increases his 
pace until he joins them.</i></p>

<p><i>They approach me, and I will myself to become one with my 
surroundings, to insinuate myself into the marble walls and stone 
walkways before they can speak to me.</i></p>

<p>I am invisible. You cannot see me. You will pass me by.</p>

<p><i>The  question was rather unnecessary.  Beta  was  almost at zenith, its

of Lagash&#8217;s sky.</i></p>

<p><i>Lagash&#8217;s own  sun, Alpha, the  one about which  it revolved, was at the

so because, as you see, Beta is the only sun in the sky.&#8221;  He smiled grimly.

First appeared in <a href="http://www.sfsite.com/fsf/">The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction</a>, August 2004.</p>

<p><i>Frankly, we were excited. This move was what our Pack needed &#8212; the four of us, at least, were sure of it. We were all tired of living in the ghetto &#8212; we were in three twentieth-century townhouses in Billings, in an &#8220;age-mixed&#8221; area full of marauding Thirteens and Fourteens and Fifteens. Talk about a people damned by CDAS &#8212; when the virus hit them, it had stuck their pituitaries and thyroids like throttles jammed open. It wasn&#8217;t just the giantism and health problems caused by a thirty-year overdose on growth hormones, testosterone, estrogen, and androgen. They suffered more from their social problems &#8212; criminality, violence, orgies, jealousy &#8212; and their endless self-pity.</i></p>

<p><i>Okay, Max liked them. And most of the rest of us had been at least entertained by living in the ghetto. At birthday parties, we could always shock the other Packs with our address. But that was when all eight of us were there, before Katrina and Ogbu went south. With eight of us, we&#8217;d felt like a full Pack &#8212; invincible, strong enough to laugh at anyone.</i></p>

<p><b>Rated R</b>.  Contains graphic sexual content and children who are a bit too grown up.  Literally.</p>

But that was when all eight of us were there, before Katrina and Ogbu went south. With eight of us, we'd felt like a full Pack -- invincible, strong enough to laugh at anyone.


Rated R.  Contains graphic sexual content and children who are a bit too grown up.  Literally.

off-putting snide remark. They were schooled in horsemanship, 
camouflage, and military strategy. They learned eye-gouging, ear-biting, kidney-punching, and &#8212; since they were destined to become 
knights and ladies &#8212; gentility.</i></p>

<p><i>So successful was their training that before long enemy

Read by Frank Key (of <a href="http://www.hootingyard.org/">Hooting Yard</a> and <a href="http://podcasts.resonancefm.com/archives/category/shows/hooting/">Hooting Yard on the Air</a>).<br />

<p><i>After the first week of practice, I knew how to anticipate Mickey&#8217;s
every move. I knew how to sense weariness in the jogging of his spine
and would inject increased levels of oxygen into his airflow when I
did. I knew that his heartbeat grew irregular when the platoon crossed
a rope bridge high over the practice-room floor, and for that exercise
I would work a calming agent into his stream. I liked to chant
patriotic slogans in his ear as we practiced. &#8220;Oh the children of
empire are marching,&#8221; I sang, &#8220;to crush the rebel threat.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>Although my programmers intended these songs to stimulate high levels
of patriotism, Mickey didn&#8217;t like them. Perhaps that&#8217;s when the first
droplets of doubt moistened the soil where the pendulous flowers of my
confusion would one day bud. . . .</i></p>

<p><i>I&#8217;m sorry, your honor, if my poetry offends you. That&#8217;s when I first
questioned his loyalty, I should have said.</i></p>

<p><b>Rated PG</b>.  Contains battle scenes, Imperial propaganda, overenthusiastic chemistry, and bad poetry.</p>

First appeared in Afterburn SF.


After the first week of practice, I knew how to anticipate Mickey's
every move. I knew how to sense weariness in the jogging of his spine
and would inject increased levels of oxygen into his airflow when I
did. I knew that his heartbeat grew irregular when the platoon crossed
a rope bridge high over the practice-room floor, and for that exercise
I would work a calming agent into his stream. I liked to chant
patriotic slogans in his ear as we practiced. "Oh the children of
empire are marching," I sang, "to crush the rebel threat."

Although my programmers intended these songs to stimulate high levels
of patriotism, Mickey didn't like them. Perhaps that's when the first
droplets of doubt moistened the soil where the pendulous flowers of my
confusion would one day bud. . . .

I'm sorry, your honor, if my poetry offends you. That's when I first
questioned his loyalty, I should have said.


Rated PG.  Contains battle scenes, Imperial propaganda, overenthusiastic chemistry, and bad poetry.
