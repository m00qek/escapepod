			<content:encoded><![CDATA[By Isaac Asimov.
Read by Stephen Eley.
First appeared in Astounding Science Fiction, September 1941.

&#8220;Of the six suns, only Beta is left in the sky. Do you see it?&#8221;

The  question was rather unnecessary.  Beta  was  almost at zenith, its
ruddy light  flooding the landscape to an unusual  orange  as  the brilliant
rays of setting Gamma died. Beta was at aphelion. It was small; smaller than
Theremon had ever seen it before, and for the moment it was undisputed ruler
of Lagash&#8217;s sky.

Lagash&#8217;s own  sun, Alpha, the  one about which  it revolved, was at the
antipodes, as were  the two distant companion pairs. The red dwarf Beta &#8212; Alpha&#8217;s immediate companion &#8212; was alone, grimly alone.

Aton&#8217;s upturned face flushed redly in the sunlight. &#8220;In just under four
hours,&#8221; he said, &#8220;civilization, as we know it, comes to an end. It will do
so because, as you see, Beta is the only sun in the sky.&#8221;  He smiled grimly.
&#8220;Print that! There&#8217;ll be no one to read it.&#8221;

Rated G.  Contains some violence and apocalyptic themes.

Read by Chris Fisher (of The Adult Space Childfree Podcast).
First appeared in The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction, August 2004.

Frankly, we were excited. This move was what our Pack needed &#8212; the four of us, at least, were sure of it. We were all tired of living in the ghetto &#8212; we were in three twentieth-century townhouses in Billings, in an &#8220;age-mixed&#8221; area full of marauding Thirteens and Fourteens and Fifteens. Talk about a people damned by CDAS &#8212; when the virus hit them, it had stuck their pituitaries and thyroids like throttles jammed open. It wasn&#8217;t just the giantism and health problems caused by a thirty-year overdose on growth hormones, testosterone, estrogen, and androgen. They suffered more from their social problems &#8212; criminality, violence, orgies, jealousy &#8212; and their endless self-pity.

Okay, Max liked them. And most of the rest of us had been at least entertained by living in the ghetto. At birthday parties, we could always shock the other Packs with our address. But that was when all eight of us were there, before Katrina and Ogbu went south. With eight of us, we&#8217;d felt like a full Pack &#8212; invincible, strong enough to laugh at anyone.

Rated R.  Contains graphic sexual content and children who are a bit too grown up.  Literally.

&#8220;What do you see?&#8221; he asks.

I want to say a menace, but instead I tap the delivery barrel and give the context-appropriate answer.  &#8220;Unused ad space.&#8221;

Suddenly he&#8217;s a schoolmaster who has finally found a bright pupil in a classroom full of dunces.

&#8220;Exactly, Ms. Monroe.  Exactly.  No square millimeter wasted, that&#8217;s what I say.&#8221;  He leans across the table and whispers conspiratorially, &#8220;We&#8217;re looking at co-branding an AOL-Time-Warner-Starbucks Lattepaloosa Crave with a Forever Fitness session discount.&#8221;

Rated R.  Contains sexual innuendo, advertising warfare, and better living through chemistry.

Read by MarBelle (of Director&#8217;s Notes).
First appeared in Strange Horizons, May 2006.

List, then. 1788, New Holland becomes New South Wales, and dear England starts to send her slithies there, her dribs and drabs and pick-pocks and whores and cutthroats, to drain the cesspool Britannia&#8217;s become. And then we pin the gravitational constant, and solve Pringle&#8217;s Mysterious Logarithm, and then just when we&#8217;re ready for it there&#8217;s an explosion of a different sort (I&#8217;m a proud product of my state school, whoreboy though I became). From the skies over Van Diemen&#8217;s Land streaks a merry flaming angel arcing down to earth and boom! Kills most of the slithies, and their Bulls, and the Murri and the Nunga in their Dreamtime too, far as any know. Sky goes red from Yangtze to Orkney. A few Nunga are left, fishing the Outer Isles. And more slithies come soon, for England&#8217;s still all-of-cess, and we&#8217;d just as soon have them die.

But! Scattered all about, like Father Christmas tossing pennies, rare earth, yttrium and scandium in luscious ashy chunks. And soon there are Magnetic Clocks, and Automatons, and Air-Cars, and good Queen Vickie trulls about in a Magnetic Carriage like everybody else. But still there is cess, and ever will be, pretend as they might at home, so still the slithies are transported.

And a good thing for Merrie Olde too, because nowhere is there as much rare earth as Australia, being that&#8217;s where the Great Boom happened, and nothing so useful for gathering ore and jellies as a big jolly family of convicts. Work for the Squatters when you&#8217;re Docked; work for them after you serve your time and are pensioned, but on your own terms. Or whore-about. Or prentice to the tech gnomes. Or mine gold, which never goes out of style. Or wander the Nullarbor, looking for the Source, and die. Or fish with the Nunga, if they&#8217;d have you, which they won&#8217;t. Stick with your duet/triune mates, if you would live out the year.

Always something to do.

But don&#8217;t fly, not much, because the variable-mag will crash you deep, and don&#8217;t depend on Carriages to work all the time. Beware your metal, for it can betray you.

Rated PG.  Contains violence, unsavory characters, and opaque slang.

Candidate Berthold gave a dismissive wave.  That wont be necessary.  Im already tired of the incessant paperwork, and I havent even been elected yet.  He laboriously began to sign each one.  Ill have plenty of time to learn after I get into office.

&#8220;Blink. Dont blink. Dont blink. Blink.&#8221; The human voice was familiar this time, expected. New orders did not come from computer voices. &#8220;This one will have to happen in a hurry, while were airlifting you to the crash site. It will be rougher than the first.&#8221;

It was. William listened to the hard drone of the aircraft engines in flight. He let that sound become the direction he followed while the pain made him into another shape so swiftly that even he did not know what he was becoming. His nanites had been commanded to emergency pitch. William was certain he could feel them racing through his cells.

Rated PG.  Contains violent crime and unusual punishment.

Rusty Tanton of the Georgia Podcast Network spoke with me for about ten minutes about Escape Pod at the SoCon 2007 unconference last week:

Bazooka Joe of the Small World Podcast did a much longer and more detailed interview that covered Escape Pod in depth and some of my other opinions on science fiction as a whole:

Read by Frank Key (of Hooting Yard and Hooting Yard on the Air).

From what I gather, there are two competing theories about me. The ones who come with binoculars and cameras believe in the monster theory. I consider myself as siding with this group. The scientists, on the other hand, with their annoying echolocation devices, hold that Im a prehistoric Earth creature, the last of my kind, cut off from my fellows. Sentimental drivel, of course. Drifting along under their hulls at night, I eavesdrop. They think Im some kind of fish. But if they ever caught me, the DNA analysis would give them a bit of a jolt.

Rated G.  Contains aquatic monsters with a penchant for memorabilia.  That&#8217;s about as scary as it gets.

Read by Matthew Wayne Selznick (of Brave Men Run and Five Minute Memoir).
First appeared in Young Warriors, ed. Tamora Pierce &amp; Josepha Sherman.

Now, this Land was the home of exceptionally brave warriors 
and beautiful damsels (and occasionally they were the same person, 
since beautiful damsels were pretty assertive back then). Each 
young boy and girl was taught all the arts of warfare, and were 
soon adept with sword, mace, lance, bow and arrow, dagger, and the 
off-putting snide remark. They were schooled in horsemanship, 
camouflage, and military strategy. They learned eye-gouging, ear-biting, kidney-punching, and &#8212; since they were destined to become 
knights and ladies &#8212; gentility.

So successful was their training that before long enemy 
armies were afraid to attack them. Within the borders of the Land 
justice was so swift that there was not a single criminal left. It 
would have been a very peaceful and idyllic kingdom indeed &#8212; 
except for the dragons. 

Rated G.  It&#8217;s a children&#8217;s story.  Not recommended for cynical audiences.

except for the dragons. 


Rated G.  It's a children's story.  Not recommended for cynical audiences.

The alien looked down the hall as though hed rather be home nursing a beer than dealing with a disgruntled housewife at 4:00 p.m. on a Friday afternoon.

Please. She tried not to sound desperate. Hes young and healthy. College degree, business administration. She thought that last might not help. With a math minor.

Rated PG.  Contains some sexual innuendo, relationship issues, and unpleasant cheese odors.

First appeared in Afterburn SF.

After the first week of practice, I knew how to anticipate Mickey&#8217;s
every move. I knew how to sense weariness in the jogging of his spine
and would inject increased levels of oxygen into his airflow when I
did. I knew that his heartbeat grew irregular when the platoon crossed
a rope bridge high over the practice-room floor, and for that exercise
I would work a calming agent into his stream. I liked to chant
patriotic slogans in his ear as we practiced. &#8220;Oh the children of
empire are marching,&#8221; I sang, &#8220;to crush the rebel threat.&#8221;

Although my programmers intended these songs to stimulate high levels
of patriotism, Mickey didn&#8217;t like them. Perhaps that&#8217;s when the first
droplets of doubt moistened the soil where the pendulous flowers of my
confusion would one day bud. . . .

I&#8217;m sorry, your honor, if my poetry offends you. That&#8217;s when I first
questioned his loyalty, I should have said.

Rated PG.  Contains battle scenes, Imperial propaganda, overenthusiastic chemistry, and bad poetry.

Read by Jared Axelrod (of The Voice of Free Planet X).

The doors whooshed open and the Goddess Kali strode up to the counter. She stopped in front of him, grinning wickedly. Straight platinum-blonde hair spilled down over her shoulders and high bare breasts, contrasting with her inky black skin. Jeremy noticed a necklace of tiny, perfectly-formed ceramic skulls hung around her neck.

&#8220;Hi, Jeremy.&#8221;

&#8220;&#8216;Lo, Suzy.&#8221;

The Goddess Kali&#8217;s eyes flashed red with anger. &#8220;Don&#8217;t call me that!&#8221; Behind her, a whole pantheon wandered the aisles, looking for late-night snacks.

Rated R.  Contains partial nudity, some language, petty crime, and a few gods&#8217; names taken in vain.

Read by Stephen Eley.

Other dragons cavorted on the airy currents. Those dragons were cherry red or lime green or creamy brown. Their riders steered them up the beach, or inland toward the mall, or back to campus.

A slender girl on a pink dragon passed us going the opposite way, her blond hair billowing. Matt waved to her. He said over his shoulder, I met that girl last night. Hold on, I want to say hi. He yanked the reins and we banked sharply. My stomach lurched. We swept around in an arc and came up alongside the girl. Her dragon had the guileless beady eyes and scrunched up cheeks of a lap dog. Matt said, Hi. Dora, right?

Deirdre, she corrected. And youre &#8230; Matt? He grinned, and she said, I like your dragon.

Rated R.  Contains sexual themes, third-world exploitation, and awkward freshmen.
