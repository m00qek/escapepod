Friday I had the incredible opportunity to have dinner with <a href="http://www.oneamericacommittee.com/">Senator John Edwards</a> and his wife Elizabeth.  (They have their own podcast and videoblog &#8212; and yes, I&#8217;m a subscriber.)    </p>

<p>I was busy literally all day Saturday, from presenting a morning &#8220;How to Podcast&#8221; seminar with <a href="http://www.podcast411.com">Rob Walch</a> to a midnight podcast-and-beer in <a href="http://www.addcast.net/">Paul Fischer&#8217;s</a> hotel room.  To everyone I met there, thanks for an incredible time and some of the best conversations I&#8217;ve had all year.  (By which I mean &#8220;last 365 days,&#8221; not 2006.)</p>

<p>If you weren&#8217;t there and you want to <i>see</i> what you missed, the fine folks at <a href="http://www.macpropodcast.com">Mac Pro Podcast</a> have put together an excellent 12-minute video summarizing the con.  They&#8217;ve got a number of great interviews in there &#8212; and if any of you wanted to know what I look like, here&#8217;s your chance.  (They say the camera adds 20 pounds&#8230;  Alas, I was in it twice, so it must have added 40 to me.)</p>

<p>The video is <a href="http://www.macpropodcast.com/2006/01/mac-pro-podcast-19-special.html">here</a>.  Check it out, and see how much fun you&#8217;ll have if you come <i>next</i> year!</p>]]></content:encoded>

lungs rattled. A few thousand years of being overweight had caused
innumerable cardiac and respiratory problems, but the job demanded it.

<p><a href="http://www.podtrac.com/audience/start-survey.aspx?ver=1&amp;pid=oahiG5aimVY$"><img src="http://www.podtrac.com/podcaster/images/survey/podtrac_survey_120x120_v1.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>Why should you fill it out?  Because it&#8217;ll help us understand how we&#8217;re doing, what you like and what you don&#8217;t, who listens to us, and it might help us in the future with grants or funding.</p>

<p>And also because I&#8217;m giving $1 to Penny Arcade&#8217;s <a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org">Child&#8217;s Play</a> for each completed survey.  Click some boxes, help a kid.  How good a deal is that?</p>

<p><b>UPDATE:</b> Janice&#8217;s comment (thanks!) made me understand that I probably ought to be a lot clearer about my intent with this.  Yes, the survey was composed by a marketing company.  <i>Their</i> intent with it, I think, was to help podcasters prepare a pitch to advertisers.  That is not <i>my</i> intent with it.  We seriously are doing better with donations right now than I think we&#8217;d be likely to do running ads, and I know as well as anyone that if we started running commercials the donations would probably drop to nothing overnight.  I don&#8217;t want to do that.  You all have been incredible in your support, and I want to redeem that trust.</p>

<p>The reason we&#8217;re using this survey (despite some annoying questions) is because it was free and ready-made, and that saves us a lot of time.  Also, we <i>do</i> want to prepare a pitch &#8212; but not to advertisers.  I&#8217;m hoping that some of this information will be useful in our application to the IRS for 501(c)(3) status, and later on if we decide to go looking for public arts grants or ad-free sponsorships.  And some of this stuff we&#8217;d simply like to know.  I&#8217;m far more interested in the questions like &#8220;What do you think of the Web design/show length/frequency?&#8221; than &#8220;How much would you trust this host to recommend real estate products?&#8221;  </p>

<p>If you find those questions obnoxious, just skip them.  I can&#8217;t really can&#8217;t blame you.  Heck, I&#8217;m not sure <b>I</b> would trust me to recommend real estate products.  If you would, you haven&#8217;t seen my lawn.</p>]]></content:encoded>

“They do talk wrong,” she whispered. “They say ‘aboot’ instead of ‘about’ and ‘proh-gress’ instead of ‘prah-gress.’ It’s like they can’t almost speak English right.”

“That’s how you tell,” Lois said. “Aliens can’t figure out how to say the letter O. Have y’all ever heard a body talk like that?”

Rated G.  Contains mild provinicialism, non-explicit discussion of sexual preferene, and screwdrivers.  (The kind with vodka.)

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I mentioned recently on the podcast, Escape Pod just reached its  six-month anniversary.  Since May of this year we&#8217;ve enjoyed  tremendous success, with thousands of listeners worldwide and new fun  stories every week.  We&#8217;re now reported to be the largest source of  free audio fiction on the Internet, and of course we&#8217;re still growing.</p>

<p>To help us celebrate, Jesse Willis of the <a href="http://www.sffaudio.com">SFFAudio.com</a> review site  has helped us to design and produce a collectible MP3 CD containing every  audio file we&#8217;ve podcast in the first six months.  These CDs are  produced using the <a href="http://www.lightscribe.com">LightScribe</a> labeling technology, which burns an  image directly to the front side of the disc, allowing us to number  and put a customized inscription on each disc.  An example of the CD:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.escapepod.org/wp-images/EP_Collection1.jpg"/></p>

<p>We&#8217;re offering these CDs as a special reward for anyone who donates $20 or more to Escape Pod between now and January 31, 2006 &#8212; or until we&#8217;ve made 200 of them, whichever comes first.  You can keep it for yourself, to catch up  on our archives, or inscribe it as a gift for somebody else and have it sent to them.</p>

<p>Want one?  All you have to do is include the following information in the comments field of your donation:</p>

<ul>
<li>The name of the recipient (yourself or anyone else)</li>
<li>The address of the recipient</li>
<li>Any personal message you&#8217;d like inscribed on the edge of the CD, up  to about 60 characters or so.  (There&#8217;s no absolute limit, but the  longer the text the more we&#8217;ll have to shrink the font.)</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that, in accordance with Escape Pod&#8217;s values, the  <em>contents</em> of the CD are all Creative Commons-licensed and can be  freely copied for all your friends.  However, the front of the disc  is absolutely unique, and cannot be easily duplicated.  I&#8217;d like to  think that someday these CDs will have collectible value, just as old  science fiction magazines have value today.</p>

<p>Thanks to all of you for your support!</p>]]></content:encoded>
